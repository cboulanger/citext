              | ABSTRACT. This study investigated correlates of five time per-
              | spectives (TPs) and the Balanced Time Perspective (BTP) construct
              | proposed by Zimbardo and colleagues. Two hundred and sixty
              | Scottish participants completed the Zimbardo Time Perspective
              | Inventory (ZTPI: Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), Subjective Happiness
              | Scale (Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999) and Mindful Attention
              | Awareness Scale (Brown and Ryan, 2003). The most prevalent TP
              | profile was moderate to high scores on all five TPs of the ZTPI. BTP
              | participants were significantly happier and more mindful. Happiness
              | and mindfulness were positively correlated but a future TP did not
              | correlate with subjective happiness. KEY WORDS • Balanced Time

              | Introduction
              | Time is not just a physical phenomenon but open to psychological interpretation
              | (James, 1890/1950). Indeed, Suddendorf and Corballis (1997) noted that the
              | monitoring of time underpinned cognitive functioning. Thus learning to deal
              | with time, at both a subjective and objective level, is vital. Since time does not
              | exist independently of the person and is in fact a psychological construct, then it
              | is one that the person continually identifies with and refines (Block, 1990).
              | Gonzalez and Zimbardo (1985) believed that the way in which we seek to

              | separate and apportion, or encircle chunks of time is a powerful and pervasive
              | characteristic of the human experience.
              | As the interest in studying time has increased so too has the terminology
              | researchers use to describe its various facets. This hasn’t necessarily led to
              | confusion but some blurring of concepts and constructs related to the study of
              | time do exist (Wallace and Rabin, 1960; Hoornaert, 1973; Hulbert and Lens,
              | 1988; Nuttin, 1985). Time attitude, time perspective, temporal orientation, and
              | time perception are often synonymous with each other and interchangeable
              | (Hulbert and Lens, 1988). Other terms such as sense of time, subjective experi-
              | ence and temporal experience all point to the notion that individuals are aware
              | of the passing of time and may crudely divide time into frames or periods. While
              | time attitude is the affective response (positive or negative) towards past, pre-
              | sent or future time frames (Nuttin, 1985) time orientation is concerned with
              | determining which of these time frames an individual tends to favour (De
              | Volder, 1979). Nuttin (1985) defines time perception as judging the passage of
              | time itself but sees time perspective as a complex construct of four sub-factors,
              | namely extension, structuralization, and realism that can be applied to both past
              | and future perspectives (see Nuttin, 1985 for more detail on factors).
              | The present article does not disagree with these definitions but chooses to
              | focus on how Zimbardo and colleagues define and operationalize TP. That is
              | that TP is ‘the manner in which individuals, and cultures, partition the flow of
              | human experience into distinct temporal categories of past, present and future’
              | (Zimbardo et al., 1997: 1008). Zimbardo and colleagues also sought to investi-
              | gate these past, present and future time frames more thoroughly by developing a
              | scale to measure TP, namely the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI).
              | Here the past, present and future temporal frames are subdivided into five sub-
              | scales. These are, firstly, the Past Negative (PN) temporal frame. This reflects a
              | pessimistic attitude towards the past and possibly the experience of traumatic
              | life events. Secondly, the Past Positive (PP), which is marked by a more
              | sentimental and positive view of one’s past. Thirdly, Present Hedonistic (PH),
              | associated with the desire for spontaneous pleasure with slight regard to risk or
              | concern for future consequences. Then there is the Present Fatalistic (PF) frame
              | which is defined as a lack of hope for the future and belief that uncontrollable
              | forces determine one’s fate. The fifth and final dimension, the Future (F), is
              | characterized by reward dependence that occurs as a result of achieving specific
              | long-term goals.
              | Time Perspective and Wellbeing Research
              | Research thus far suggests that particular temporal frames have implications
              | for various aspects of wellbeing. For example, PN has been correlated with
              | DRAKE ET AL.: TIME PERSPECTIVE AND CORRELATES OF WELLBEING
meta          | 49
text          | depression, anxiety and low self-esteem, and it has been demonstrated that PN
              | individuals have fewer close friends (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), gamble more
              | (Wassarman, 2002) and are more likely to be in alcohol and drug programmes
              | (Klingeman, 2001) than those in other TP groups. Findings from Lyubomirsky
              | and Nolen-Hoeksema (1995) and Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow (1993) confirm
              | this. In contrast, high PP scores are related to high levels of self-esteem and
              | happiness (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), agreeableness and energy (Goldberg and
              | Maslach, 1996) and indicative of the use of social support networks (Holman
              | and Zimbardo, 1999, cited in Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999). Present oriented (PH
              | and PF) individuals are less influenced by safe sex practices (Rothspan and
              | Read, 1996) and tend to engage in risky driving (Zimbardo et al., 1997),
              | alcohol and drug misuse (Strathman et al., 1994; Keough et al., 1999) and suffer
              | chronic homelessness (Epel et al., 1999). However, moderate scores for the PH
              | factor, which have been positively correlated with novelty and sensation seek-
              | ing, can be beneficial for the individual provided they have some concept of
              | future consequences (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999).
              | The Future sub-scale has been associated with less psychopathy (Wallace,
              | 1956, cited in Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), and positively correlated with partici-
              | pation in a cancer-screening programme (Guarino et al., 1999). It is therefore
              | regarded as the more constructive time perspective in terms of engaging in
              | positive health behaviours. According to Kazakina (1999, cited in Zimbardo
              | and Boyd, 1999), individuals with a more future-oriented outlook are more
              | optimistic and anticipate positive outcomes. This can, in itself, perpetuate more
              | positive functioning and can lead to higher levels of academic achievement
              | (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), elevated levels of participation in research studies
              | (Harber et al., 2003), success in prison training programmes (Chubick et al.,
              | 1999) and more adaptive coping strategies for obtaining shelter when homeless
              | (Epel et al., 1999). It has, however, been suggested that an overemphasis on
              | future goals compromises spontaneity resulting in poor ability to ‘switch off’
              | and enjoy the present (Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2003). Similarly an over-
              | emphasis, or a temporal bias, towards a present orientation is associated with
              | negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety and depression (Wills et al.,, 2001),
              | alcohol use, smoking and illegal drug use (Keough et al., 1999; Wills et al.,
              | 2001) and engaging in risky sexual practises (Rothspan and Read, 1996).
              | Despite some findings suggesting that a focus on the present is associated with
              | subjective wellbeing and general happiness (Csikszentmihalyi, 1992; Keough,
              | et al., 1999) it seems that seeking immediate gratification, while disregarding
              | the consequences of actions, is typical of a predisposition to a present temporal
              | bias.
              | To facilitate wellbeing Boniwell and Zimbardo (2004) propose that one
              | should strive to achieve what they call a Balanced Time Perspective (BTP). This
              | is characterized, statistically, as moderate to high scores for the PP, PH, and F

              | factors and relatively low scores for the PN and PF factors. It is operationally
              | defined as the ability to hold past present and future time perspectives concur-
              | rently but importantly to be able to move between each perspective and to use
              | the most appropriate one in a given situation. Zimbardo and Boyd (1999) go as
              | far as to suggest that a BTP is central to optimal functioning. By that they mean
              | that the individual will reap psychological benefits if they are able to ‘work hard
              | when there is a mission to be accomplished, but play hard when the work is
              | done’ (Zimbardo, 2002: 62). By achieving a BTP an individual’s actions are
              | shaped by a consideration of all three temporal zones (Zimbardo and Boyd,
              | 1999; Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2003, 2004) as opposed to the limiting ability of
              | a dispositional bias towards one particular time frame. Accordingly, Boniwell
              | and Zimbardo (2004) propose that individuals with a BTP will be happier than
              | those who do not have a BTP. However, most TP research has yet to establish
              | this. Most of the research has focused on specific temporal frames using varied
              | TP measurements rather than focusing on the BTP construct. For example,
              | Kazakina (1999, cited in Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999) found positive correlations
              | between a present orientation and positive affect and between a past positive ori-
              | entation and life satisfaction. There is also evidence of positive relationships
              | between present orientation and general happiness (Kammann and Flett, 1983),
              | life satisfaction (Diener et al., 1985) and optimism (Lennings, 2000). Similarily,
              | Zaleski et al. (2001) showed that a future perspective was positively associated
              | with subjective wellbeing. However, a future orientation is positively correlated
              | with higher socio-economic status, which is only weakly related to wellbeing
              | (Diener, 2000). Assessing subjective wellbeing has been done in many ways
              | (e.g. Diener, 1997; Peterson, 2000) and there are numerous constructs that relate
              | to subjective wellbeing. For the purposes of the present study we chose to focus
              | on a global, subjective assessment of happiness. Thus the present study used the
              | Subjective Happiness Scale (Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999). This simply asks
              | people to evaluate how happy or unhappy they are and does not involve cogni-
              | tive evaluations of the quality of, or satisfaction with, life (Lyubomirsky, 2001).
              | The notion that a BTP allows the individual to be more fully engaged in any
              | given situation corresponds with an aspect of consciousness called mindfulness.
              | Mindfulness, according to Hanh (1976) facilitates conscious awareness of the
              | reality of the present. Brown and Ryan (2003) investigated mindfulness as an
              | individual differences attribute by adopting the Mindfulness Attention
              | Awareness Scale (MAAS). The study demonstrated significant positive correla-
              | tions between mindfulness and self-esteem, optimism, life satisfaction, and
              | wellbeing, and negative correlations with neuroticism, anxiety and depression.

text          | Aims of the Present Study
              | Thus the aims of the present study were first, to operationalize the five TPs of
              | the ZTPI and establish what relationship there is between these five temporal
              | frames and subjective happiness. It is important that the measurement of happi-
              | ness chosen for this study is asking for a simple judgement of how happy or
              | unhappy participants feel which is in contrast to other studies that have used
              | more global judgements of life satisfaction. Second, the BTP construct will also
              | be operationalized to establish what relationship, if any, having a BTP has with
              | subjective happiness scores. Third, to investigate to what extent mindfulness
              | relates to each of the TPs and the BTP construct. Since mindfulness is synony-
              | mous with conscious absorption in the present then positive correlations
              | between particular TPs and the BTP should be evident. Thus the study will seek
              | to validate assumptions of the TP theory and the BTP construct as viewed by
              | Zimbardo and colleagues.
              | On the basis of findings from previous research several hypotheses were
              | proposed. First, that those participants with a BTP profile would be more mind-
              | ful and happier than those not achieving a BTP profile (scores spread across
              | the other five temporal factors of the ZTPI). Second, that PP and F would be
              | positively correlated with mindfulness, while PN and PF orientations would be
              | negatively correlated with mindfulness. Further, given that high scores on the
              | PH scale are associated with risky activities and thrill seeking (Boniwell and
              | Zimbardo, 2004), which would be considered unmindful behaviour, it was
              | predicted that there would be a negative correlation between PH and mindful-
              | ness. It was also hypothesized that PP, PH and F would be positively related
              | to subjective happiness, but that PN and PF would be negatively related to
              | happiness. Finally, based on Brown and Ryan’s (2003) findings it was predicted
              | that mindfulness and subjective happiness would be positively correlated.
              | Method
              | Design
              | A correlational questionnaire-based design was used. The dependent variables
              | were participants’ scores on the ZTPI, comprising five sub-scales; past negative
              | (PN), present hedonistic (PH), future (F), past positive (PP) and present fatalis-
              | tic (PF), the MAAS and subjective happiness scores.
              | Participants
              | Two hundred and sixty participants, 170 male and 90 female, ranging in age
              | from 16 to 83, completed the study. Participants were recruited via the adoption
meta          | 52

              | of opportunity and snowball sampling methodology and consisted of students at
              | the Glasgow Caledonian University (UK), family, friends and associates of the
              | research team. The sample was thus drawn from a wider age range and living
              | circumstances than an exclusively university-based sample.
              | Materials
              | The questionnaire consisted of demographic items ascertaining age and gender
              | and the following inventories.
              | Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI: Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999):
              | this is a 56-item self-report instrument, with five sub-scales as described previ-
              | ously, which measures participants’ time-related attitudes and behaviour by ask-
              | ing them to rate, on a Likert scale, how true each statement is of them (1 being
              | ‘very untrue’ and 5 being’ very true). The scale was developed from case
              | studies, surveys and factor analysis and has shown reliability, validity and ease
              | of administration (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999).
              | Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS: Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999): this is a
              | four-item self-report scale used to measure global subjective happiness. Two
              | items require participants to produce absolute measures of happiness with
              | regard to their own rating and that relative to peers. A further two questions ask
              | participants to rate to what extent descriptions of unhappy and happy people are
              | typical of them. All items are measured on a 7-point Likert scale and an average
              | score is taken across the four scores, with the fourth item being reverse-coded.
              | Higher scores reflect higher levels of subjective happiness.
              | Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS: Brown and Ryan, 2003):
              | this is a 15-item scale that assesses individual differences in the frequency of
              | mindfulness states by asking participants to rate how frequently or infrequently
              | each experience happens to them. It also utilizes a Likert scale where 1 repre-
              | sents ‘almost always’ through to 6 which represents ‘almost never’.
              | Procedure
              | A pilot study ensured that the questionnaires were feasible and easy to follow.
              | The battery of questionnaires were then distributed using opportunity sampling
              | and snowballing techniques. Written instructions informed participants that it
              | would take approximately 10–15 minutes to complete. Participants were given a
              | 14-day period within which to complete and return the battery of questionnaires
              | to a secure central point. Confidentiality was guaranteed. No payment or any
              | other incentive was offered.

text          | Results
              | Results pertaining to the number of participants holding a BTP profile will be
              | given first. These individuals were then tested against those with non-BTP
              | profiles (the other five temporal frames) in terms of subjective happiness and
              | mindfulness. A further analysis will concentrate on correlations between sub-
              | jective happiness, mindfulness and the five temporal frames themselves.
              | How many participants achieved a BTP?
              | To calculate this, low, moderate and high TP scores were obtained by dividing TP
              | scores for each of the five factors as close as possible to the 33rd and 66th
              | percentiles, resulting in three groups. Applying Zimbardo’s theory that low
              | scores on PN and PF, moderate to high on PP, F and PH constitute a BTP, we
              | could calculate that only 13 participants (10 females and 3 males) achieved a BTP.
              | BTP and subjective happiness
              | Table 1 shows means and standard deviations for SHS scores across two levels
              | of TP profile. Group 1 (n = 247) represents those participants who did not have
              | a BTP profile. Group 2 (n = 13) represents those who did. As can be seen from
              | Table 1 the group with a BTP profile scored significantly higher on the SHS than
              | those with other TP profiles (t = 5.04, df = 12, p = .0001). Thus the hypothesis
              | that happiness scores would differ significantly between those with a BTP
              | profile and those without was supported.

              | group with the BTP profile did indeed score significantly higher on mindfulness
              | than those with other TP profiles (t = 2.63, df = 12, p = .011). Thus the hypoth-
              | esis that mindfulness scores would differ significantly between those with a
              | BTP profile and those without was supported.
              | The five temporal frames and their relationship to subjective happiness
              | The correlation matrix (Table 2, next page) shows there was no significant rela-
              | tionship between the F and PF time perspectives and subjective happiness (F, r
              | = –.074; PF, r = –.0.97). However, PH and PP were significantly correlated with
              | happiness. For PH and PP, the relationship was positive (PH, r = .155, p < 0.01;
              | PP, r = .214, p < 0.001). The PN factor was negatively correlated with
              | happiness (r = –.416, p < .001). As this result accounted for 17 per cent of
              | the variance, there was a relatively strong tendency for individuals with a
              | pessimistic view of the past to score low on the happiness scale.
              | The five temporal frames and mindfulness
              | The five temporal frames (PN, PH, F, PP and PF) were correlated with mindful-
              | ness. Table 2 shows there were no significant correlations between F and mind-
              | fulness (r = .027). However, PP, PN, PH and PF related significantly to
              | mindfulness. For PP, the relationship was positive (R = .125, p < 0.5), account-
              | ing for 2 per cent of the variance and indicating a weak tendency for those with
              | a high PP score to be more mindful. For PN, the relationship was negative (r =
              | –.492, p < 0.001), accounting for 24 per cent of the variance, indicating that
              | those who score high in PN have a moderate tendency to be less mindful. For PF
              | and PH, the relationship was also negative (PF, r = –.23, p < 0.001; PH, r =
              | –.116, p < 0.05), accounting for 5 and 1 per cent of the variance respectively and
              | indicating that there is a weak tendency for those with high PF and PH scores to
              | be low in mindfulness.
              | Discussion
              | The present study operationalized the five temporal frames of the ZTPI and
              | established what relationship there was between these and self-reported subjec-
              | tive happiness. Moreover, the relationship between a BTP and subjective happi-
              | ness scores was investigated and compared to the five non-BTP temporal frames
              | or time perspectives. In addition, the extent to which mindfulness related to each
              | of the temporal frames and the BTP construct was clarified. It was proposed that
              | individuals with a BTP would be happier and more mindful than those with
              | other profiles. The results did indeed show that 13 individuals matched the

              | criteria for a BTP. Analysis of the BTP group compared to those with other
              | profiles showed that those with a BTP had significantly higher mean scores for
              | subjective happiness and mindfulness than individuals with other TP profiles.
              | However, this study found that the most prevalent temporal frame profile
              | constituted individuals with moderate to high scores in all five of the frames
              | (n = 43). These individuals set themselves apart from the BTP group by having
              | moderate to high scores in the risk factors of past negative and present fatalistic.
              | An analysis of the five temporal frames in relation to happiness and mindful-
              | ness was also carried out. It was hypothesized that the PH- and PP-subjective
              | happiness relationship would be positive and that the PN-subjective happiness
              | correlation be negative. These hypotheses were indeed confirmed and allow us
              | to state that the happier participants were those more likely to hold positive as
              | opposed to negative attitudes towards their past, be more spontaneous and live
              | more in the moment.
              | Rather surprisingly the F factor was not significantly correlated with subjec-
              | tive happiness. A future orientation is apparently linked to positive functioning
              | (Kazakina, 1999), participation in health screening (Guarino et al., 1999) and
              | less psychopathy (Wallace, 1956). It follows then that this would link to
              | higher levels of subjective happiness. However, it has to be acknowledged that
              | there is some degree of ambiguity in research findings between time perspec-
              | tives and wellbeing. Despite the links with higher optimism (Zimbardo and
              | Ryan, 1999), self-efficacy, and more adaptive coping strategies (Epel et al.,
              | 1999) one should temper these findings by bearing in mind that Boniwell and
              | Zimbardo (2003) have suggested that an emphasis on achieving future goals
              | may compromise the level of enjoyment in present activities and the importance
              | of family values at the root of our own past. The present authors propose that an
meta          | 56
text          | TIME & SOCIETY 17(1)
              | emphasis on future goals not only pulls people away from absorption in present
              | reality but could also create more anxiety and hurriedness. It is also the case that
              | one should take into account how future-oriented people would feel if goals and
              | plans are thwarted by current obstacles. Further investigations of the phenome-
              | nology of the future orientation is warranted.
              | It was expected that the PF sub-scale would be negatively correlated with
              | subjective happiness. It is not surprising that this aspect has been supported
              | since PF is said to be the most destructive factor as it has been associated with
              | higher levels of aggression, anxiety and depression (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999).
              | A fatalistic frame of the present does not however preclude concern for future
              | consequences. For example, in relation to health-promoting behaviour Hamilton
              | et al. (2003) found that a present orientation was not negatively correlated to
              | such behaviour.
              | It is our belief that this is the first study to test mindfulness in relation to time
              | perspective. It was hypothesized that if mindfulness represents awareness and
              | the keeping of conscious thoughts in the present then one would expect that
              | those high on mindfulness are first, happier and second, possess particular time
              | perspectives relevant to the mindfulness state. It may be that these people,
              | thanks to the mindfulness state, possess more ability to balance work, leisure
              | and family demands and may be more likely to possess a BTP profile. Thus it
              | was hypothesized that mindfulness scores would differ significantly across
              | those with a BTP profile and those without. Indeed the results showed that the
              | BTP group participants did score significantly higher on mindfulness than those
              | with other TP profiles. As predicted, certain temporal frames were related to
              | MAAS scores. As predicted the PP-MAAS correlation was positive, while the
              | PN-, PH- and PF-MAAS relationships were negative. However, the association
              | between the future temporal frame and MAAS scores though positive was not
              | significant. Overall we can say that those who were more mindful tended to have
              | a more favourable perception of the past and towards life in general. Examining
              | relationships between the ZTPI and MAAS and finding that PP-MAAS correla-
              | tions were in the predicted direction offers some validation for PP factor of the
              | ZTPI itself.
              | Limitations and Future Considerations
              | It has to be acknowledged that the correlational nature of the research design
              | precludes even the slightest speculation on causal connections or underlying
              | mechanisms between a BTP, the other temporal frames, and wellbeing.
              | However, the fact that those with a BTP showed higher levels of aspects of well-
              | being supports basic tenets of the BTP construct. This study, we believe, is the
              | first to attempt a BTP profile analysis and as such presents evidence in support
              | DRAKE ET AL.: TIME PERSPECTIVE AND CORRELATES OF WELLBEING
meta          | 57
text          | of the Zimbardo and Boyd’s (1999) BTP theory. However, these findings should
              | be regarded as preliminary. A replication study seeking to capture more indi-
              | viduals with a BTP profile would be a prudent next step. Since ethics stipulated
              | that anonymity be afforded each participant in the present study, in depth inter-
              | views with those with a BTP were not possible. We therefore suggest that future
              | studies consider case study analyses of those found to have a BTP. This would
              | allow extension of the theory and operationalization of it within a practical
              | setting.
              | The PP–subjective happiness correlation was the highest positive result of all
              | the time perspectives and subjective happiness scores. These findings are in line
              | with previous research on the happiness and time perspective (Kammann and
              | Flett, 1983; Lennings, 2000; Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2004). That a positive
              | relationship was found is accepted but it is only a relationship and in no way
              | constitutes a causal explanation nor indicates underlying mechanisms. In addition
              | the present study did not take into account participants’ past positive and/or
              | negative life events. Thus we have no understanding of context that may have
              | contributed to decisions made by participants when they were completing the
              | questionnaires. Future research should attempt to ascertain exposure to
              | past negative and positive life events as mediators. Better still would be an appre-
              | ciation of coping mechanisms in those with a PP profile alongside a personality
              | measure. Individual difference data such as this can inform theory and possibly
              | interventions aimed at altering temporal frames to maximise positive functioning
              | and wellbeing.
              | It is important to point out that results here could be influenced by the
              | measurement of happiness chosen. Equivocal results may be produced because
              | different surveys adopt different interpretations of the subjective wellbeing con-
              | struct. The adoption of the SHS scale in this study was a deliberate attempt
              | to use a global measure that measured simply how happy or unhappy people
              | perceived themselves to be. Since measures of wellbeing assess either cognitive
              | or the emotional components of the construct, the present authors argue that
              | simplification was needed here. Notwithstanding this, it would be interesting to
              | probe the emotional components with respect to time perspective more purpose-
              | fully. For example, studies could perhaps use such measures as the Positive and
              | Negative Affect Scale (PANAS: Watson et al., 1988) and/or adopt the Emotion
              | Diary (Oatley and Duncan, 1994; Duncan and Grazzani-Gavazzi, 2004) or
              | Experience Sampling Methodologies. Such strategies would place scores on
              | time perspective scales in context. These would be most appropriate in a study
              | that aimed to investigate possible changes in the five factors across time.
              | The extent to which these results are generalizable must be treated with
              | caution even though steps were taken to widen recruitment beyond the student
              | population and to use a wide age range. We did not feel that there were sufficient
              | numbers in particular age categories to be able to take a look at developmental
meta          | 58
text          | TIME & SOCIETY 17(1)
              | changes in time perspectives. This would be an important next step for future
              | research. Some consideration should also be given to the cultural context within
              | which this investigation took place. In this Scottish sample it was found that a
              | substantial number presented scores that indicated the predominance of past
              | negative and present fatalistic outlooks. The intriguing question is whether this
              | is serendipitous or a part of the character of Scottish culture? Indeed, to what
              | extent other cultures either share this profile or have their own unique profile is
              | worthy of investigation. Since some research has indicated cultural variation
              | with regards to time and time perspective (Spangler and Petrovich, 1978; Sagie
              | et al., 1996; Brislan and Kim, 2003) we may have to accept that results here may
              | not be generalizable. However, research on time perspective itself is not yet
              | extensive enough to begin to suggest that certain individuals and/or cultures
              | ‘own’ a particular global temporal bias.
              | This research offers preliminary data on the BTP profile and the five tempo-
              | ral frames of the ZTPI. There is much yet that can be done to elucidate the BTP
              | profile itself and whether a temporal bias that compromises wellbeing would be
              | amenable to change, given appropriate interventions. Perhaps interventions that
              | facilitate the reflective, self-awareness skills inherent in mindfulness are a first
              | step in this process.
