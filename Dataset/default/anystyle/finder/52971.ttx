              | Abstract: Vietnamese Buddhist monk and peace activist Thích Nhất Hạnh has been
              | a leading figure in the promotion of nonviolent practice throughout the world. We
              | examine his concept of engaged Buddhism, theories of nonviolence, and intersec-
              | tions with rhetorical and communication studies. His approach takes nonviolence
              | beyond the realm of refusing to use physical violence to the recognition that lan-
              | guage itself can be violent. In order to understand this approach we detail the con-
              | cepts of interbeing, loving speech, and deep listening. We examine the role of love
              | in Nhất Hạnh’s theory of nonviolence, comparing it with approaches taken by Ma-
              | hatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Examples are given from many of Nhất
              | Hạnh’s speeches and writings with particular attention paid to a love letter he wrote
              | to US President George W. Bush during the Iraq War. Thích Nhất Hạnh offers the
              | practice of writing a love letter to one’s perceived enemy as a means to persuade for
              | a turn to nonviolence.

              | Introduction
              | Most discussions of nonviolence focus on physical actions: protests, sit-ins, non-
              | cooperation, and other practices that do not cause physical harm to others (see Gal-
              | tung 1965, Martin & Varney 2003, Schock 2003, and Sharp 1973). Buddhist monk
              | and activist Thích Nhất Hạnh’s contribution to theories and practices of nonviolence
              | extends the concept to the discursive, the cognitive, and the spiritual spheres. Re-
              | lying on the concept of “interbeing” – a Buddhist concept of the interdependence of
              | all things on one another – Nhất Hạnh explains that seeking to change the world
              | through nonviolence should be practiced in each of these areas. The members of a
              | movement must not only eschew weapons and other forms of physical violence, but
              | also avoid speech that is harmful. In the sense of interbeing, when we use words of
              | force, of coercion, we are not only committing violence against those we perceive as
              | our adversaries, but against ourselves as well.
              | Nhất Hạnh is not a rhetorical theorist, but communication is at the heart of his
              | perspective. What we present is a synthetic rhetorical theory of nonviolence that
              | arises through his speeches, books, and other writings. In the following sections we
              | will briefly introduce Nhất Hạnh, discuss several of his key ideas about communica-
              | tion including interbeing, non-attachment to views, and the role of love. Next we
              | connect his theory to relevant scholarship about nonviolence in rhetorical and com-
              | munication studies. We conclude with an analysis of a love letter sent by Nhất Hạnh
              | to President George W. Bush in response to the Iraq War.
              | 1. Thích Nhất Hạnh’s life and ideas
              | Born in Vietnam in 1926, Thích Nhất Hạnh witnessed firsthand the death and
              | destruction brought on by war. Much of the 20th Century in Vietnam was marked by
              | internal conflict and struggles against foreign occupations. Nhất Hạnh entered a
              | Buddhist monastery at 16 and was fully ordained in 1949, at the age of 23. Nhất

text          | Hạnh quickly emerged as a leader, scholar, and independent thinker within the Viet-
              | namese Buddhist establishment.
              | In 1954, the French lost Vietnam to nationalist forces and the Geneva Accords
              | divided the country into North and South. During this time of great internal uphea-
              | val, Nhất Hạnh struggled with how, as an emerging monastic, he should respond to
              | the division and devastation around him. He coined the term “engaged Buddhism”
              | to describe his integration of contemplative life and social action (Ratner, 2016, p.
              | 34). Nhất Hạnh describes how his approach to activism was born out of his personal
              | experience of violence:
              | When I was in Vietnam, so many of our villages were being bombed.
              | Along with my monastic brothers and sisters, I had to decide what to do.
              | Should we continue to practice in our monasteries, or should we leave the
              | meditation halls in order to help the people who were suffering under the
              | bombs? After careful reflection, we decided to do both—to go out and help
              | people and to do so in mindfulness. We called it engaged Buddhism.
              | Mindfulness must be engaged. Once there is seeing, there must be acting.
              | … We must be aware of the real problems of the world. Then, with
              | mindfulness, we will know what to do and what not to do to be of help.
              | (1991, p. 91)
              | Buddhism, which had traditionally been more focused on inner transformation,
              | did not have a clear tradition of social activism. Nhất Hạnh collaborated with like-
              | minded peers in Vietnam as he continued to develop both a theory and practice of a
              | nonviolent, engaged approach to Buddhism.
              | In the early 1960s, Nhất Hạnh came to the United States for two years, where he
              | lectured on Buddhism at Cornell and Columbia Universities (Nhất Hạnh, 1991;
              | 1999). As the United States’ involvement in the conflict in Vietnam escalated, he
              | returned to North America in 1966 to speak out against the war. He took this oppor-
              | tunity to meet with and exchange ideas about nonviolence with important Western
              | spiritual figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Thomas Merton, and Daniel
              | Berrigan (King, 2003). As a result of Nhất Hạnh’s advocacy, both North and South
              | Vietnam considered him a threat and denied him the right to return to Vietnam,
              | beginning a 39 year exile. In 1967, Martin Luther King, Jr. nominated Nhất Hạnh
              | for the Nobel Peace Prize, saying: “Here is an apostle of peace and non-violence. …
              | His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world
              | brotherhood, to humanity” (1967). The Nobel Peace Prize, however, was not
              | awarded to anybody that year.
              | From his adopted home base in France, Nhất Hạnh has continued to advocate for
              | peace and social justice, while being a pioneer introducing many Westerners to
              | Buddhism. In addition to founding six monasteries and dozens of practice centers in
              | America and Europe, Thích Nhất Hạnh has published over 100 books on meditation,
              | mindfulness, and engaged Buddhism. Through these works he has presented his

              | ideas on the concepts of interbeing, non-attachment to views, loving speech, deep
              | listening, and the primacy of love that we will discuss in the next sections.
              | 1.1. Interbeing
              | In order to understand Thích Nhất Hạnh’s approach to nonviolence, it is essen-
              | tial to first explore his belief in the concept of interbeing. In Buddhist doctrine, this
              | principle is traditionally called dependent origination or dependent co-arising. It
              | refers to the idea that everything in the universe is interconnected through a complex
              | web of cause and effect. Thích Nhất Hạnh describes this principle of intercon-
              | nectedness through the exploration of the origins of a piece of paper:
              | If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this
              | sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees
              | cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essen-
              | tial for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot
              | be here either. We can say that the cloud and the paper inter-are. “Inter-
              | being” is a word that is not in the dictionary yet, but if we combine the pre-
              | fix “inter-” with the verb “to be,” we have a new verb, “inter-be”...Looking
              | even more deeply, we can see we are in it too. This is not difficult to see,
              | because when we look at a sheet of paper, the sheet of paper is part of our
              | perception. Your mind is in here and mine is also, so we can say that every-
              | thing is in here in this sheet of paper. (1987, p. 53)
              | Another way of saying this is that “we are a part of everything, and everything is
              | part of us” (Nhất Hạnh, 1991, p. 103). Looking at things from this perspective, it
              | becomes apparent that Nhất Hạnh believes that we are not really completely sepa-
              | rate from our enemies. He believes that “we belong to each other; we cannot cut
              | reality into pieces. The well-being of ‘this’ is the well-being of ‘that,’ so we have to
              | do things together. Every side is ‘our side’; there is no evil side” (Nhất Hạnh, 1991,
              | p. 103). Polinska (2007) reports that this concept of interbeing is at the center of
              | Nhất Hạnh’s ideas about nonviolence. She observes that Nhất Hạnh’s “Buddhist
              | teachings focus on how our interdependence with others makes partisan conflict
              | unintelligible. Our interbeing with others implies that whether we are so called ’op-
              | pressors’ or ‘the oppressed,’ we all contribute to injustice and violence in the world”
              | (Polinska, 2007, p. 93). So one can see how Nhất Hạnh’s concept of “loving your
              | enemy” comes from a perspective in which he sees himself as intrinsically con-
              | nected to any person or group of people that could be conceptualized as an “enemy.”
              | Even the very idea of an “enemy” does not fit into this worldview, in which
              | everyone is connected to one another.
              | 1.2. Non-attachment to views
              | Another essential Buddhist principle that informs Nhất Hạnh’s ideas about non-
              | violence is “non-attachment to views” (2008, p. 8). Nhất Hạnh emphasizes the cen-
              | trality of this tenant to his thinking, not just about social activism, but about the
              | world itself: “The basic spirit of Buddhism is non-attachment to views.” He even

text          | warns against attachment to Buddhist principles themselves: “If you are attached to
              | these teachings, you are lost” (Nhất Hạnh, 2008, p. 8). Nhất Hạnh is particularly
              | concerned about the relationship between inflexible opinions and violence. He
              | warns that “War is the outcome of attachment to views, of fanaticism...Peace cannot
              | exist if we maintain our fanaticism concerning our views” (Nhất Hạnh, 2008, p. 8).
              | The commitment to non-attachment to views is so essential to Nhất Hạnh, that this
              | principle informed the first three of The Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings, the foun-
              | dational precepts of the Order of Interbeing that he established in Saigon in 1964
              | (Nhất Hạnh, 1997a). “The Order of Interbeing was born as a spiritual resistance
              | movement. It is based completely on the teachings of the Buddha. The First
              | Mindfulness Training—non-attachment to views, freedom from all ideologies—was
              | a direct answer to the war. Everyone was ready to die and to kill for their beliefs”
              | (Nhất Hạnh, 2008, p. 8).
              | In the Third of the Mindfulness Trainings, the commitment to non-attachment to
              | views leads to a discussion of love and compassion:
              | We are committed to respecting the right of others to be different, to choose
              | what to believe and how to decide. We will, however, learn to help others
              | let go of and transform fanaticism and narrowness through loving speech
              | and compassionate dialogue” (Nhất Hạnh, 2007, p. 104).
              | The Eighth and Ninth Mindfulness Trainings bring our attention to deep listening
              | and truthful and loving speech that further develops his focus on communication as
              | central to engaged Buddhism. Nhất Hạnh’s particular approach to nonviolence is
              | encapsulated in The Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings, which advocate approaching
              | all people—including opponents—from a perspective of interconnection, openness,
              | and ultimately love.
              | 1.3. What does “love” mean?
              | At this point it is important to clarify what Thích Nhất Hạnh and others are refer-
              | ring to when they talk about love, because this word can trigger numerous associa-
              | tions. Frequently we think of romantic desire or familial affection when we hear the
              | word “love;” for Nhất Hạnh “love” has a different connotation. In his book
              | Teachings on Love, Nhất Hạnh discusses the Sanskrit word “maitri,” which “can be
              | translated as ‘love’ or ‘loving kindness’ :
              | Some Buddhist teachers prefer “loving kindness,” as they find the word
              | “love” too dangerous. But I prefer the word “love.” Words sometimes get
              | sick and we have to heal them. We have been using the word “love” to
              | mean appetite or desire, as in “I love hamburgers.” We have to use lan-
              | guage more carefully. “Love” is a beautiful word; we have to restore its
              | meaning. The word “maitri” has roots in the word mitra which means
              | friend. In Buddhism, the primary meaning of love is friendship. (1997b, p.

              | The primacy of love as a feature of nonviolence is also found in the words of
              | Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Terchek (2001) observes that “Gandhi
              | wants to weave the threads of love everywhere and extend them to everyone, inclu-
              | ding our enemies” and views “Gandhian love” as founded on an “openness that
              | enables a person to find a unity and mutuality with others.” Gandhi equated love
              | with nonviolence itself: “Nonviolence, in its active form, is goodwill toward all life.
              | It is pure love” (1996, p. 41). For Gandhi then, love is not only an interpersonal
              | emotion, that is, a feeling that exists between two people. Neither is love something
              | soft or sentimental. Key to Gandhi’s concept of nonviolence is his belief in love as
              | perhaps one of the most powerful forces for social change: “Power is of two kinds.
              | One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power based
              | on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent then the one derived from
              | fear of punishment” (Gandhi, 1925, p. 15).
              | It was after reading Gandhi that King first came to see “love” as applying to
              | more than just individuals, but as being a powerful force for change (1956, p. 97).
              | When King appealed to his followers to “love your enemy,” he used the Greek term
              | agape to describe the “love” that he referred to. “Agape means understanding, re-
              | deeming good will for all men,” explained King. He went on to describe it as a “love
              | seeking to create and preserve community” (King & Washington, 1986, p. 19). For
              | King, the principle of nonviolence in intrinsically linked to his ideas of “love”:
              | At the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love. The nonviolent
              | resister would contend that in the struggle for human dignity, the oppressed
              | people of the world must not succumb to the temptation of becoming bitter
              | or indulging in hate campaigns. To retaliate in kind would do nothing but
              | intensify the existence of hate in the universe. Along the way of life, so-
              | meone must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of
              | hate. This can only be done by projecting the ethic of love to the center of
              | our lives. (King & Washington, 1986, p. 19)
              | Just as “understanding” is the first word King used to define agape, it is also at
              | the center of Nhất Hạnh’s idea of love: “Understanding and love are not two things,
              | but just one” (Nhất Hạnh, 1987, p. 14). For Nhất Hạnh, looking deeply into the
              | wants, needs, and suffering of another is essential for achieving both love and peace.
              | Agreeing with King and Gandhi, Nhất Hạnh believes that “Love is the essence of
              | nonviolence” (1993, p. 39). He goes on to say that that “love” is essential to both the
              | principled and pragmatic goals of nonviolence: “Out of love and the willingness to
              | act selflessly, strategies, tactics, and techniques for a nonviolent struggle arise natu-
              | rally” (Nhất Hạnh, 1993, p. 39). Nhất Hạnh’s view is not universally shared. In the
              | next section we will discuss differing conceptions of nonviolence and review the
              | ways that rhetorical and communication studies, and to a more limited extent politi-
              | cal science and peace studies, have treated the subject.

              | principled nonviolence (see Martin & Varney 2003, Schock 2003, and Sharp 1973).
              | Those taking the pragmatic approach view nonviolence primarily through the lens of
              | action, including peaceful protest, sit-ins, and boycotts, without the necessity for a
              | corresponding set of beliefs in the fundamental values of nonviolence. According to
              | Schock, “nonviolent action is active—it involves activity in the collective pursuit of
              | social or political objectives—and it is non-violent—it does not involve physical
              | force or the threat of physical force against human beings” (2003, p. 705). This
              | strategic approach focuses on nonviolent action as a purely tactical tool, even a wea-
              | pon, which can be used to fight oppressive regimes.
              | Another important perspective on nonviolence is that the motives and beliefs of
              | those employing nonviolence are essential elements in its practice. Principled non-
              | violence, exemplified by Gandhi, King, and Nhất Hạnh, “seeks to love potential
              | enemies rather than destroy them and promotes nonviolent peaceful means to peace-
              | ful ends. Its preferred processes are persuasion, cooperation and nonviolent resis-
              | tance to forceful coercion for political purposes” (Clements, 2015, p. 12). Alternati-
              | vely, Gene Sharp, a leading proponent of pragmatic nonviolence, argues that:
              | the use of the term “nonviolence” is especially unfortunate, because it con-
              | fuses these forms of mass action with beliefs in ethical or religious nonvio-
              | lence (“principled nonviolence”). Those beliefs, which have their merits,
              | are different phenomena that usually are unrelated to mass struggles con-
              | ducted by people who do not share such beliefs. (2005b, p. 9)
              | The principled nonviolence approach finds support from religious figures, but is
              | not sectarian in its practice. That the three leaders in nonviolent movements come
              | from Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist perspectives demonstrates that their perspec-
              | tive transcends exclusionary religious beliefs. Whether pragmatic or principled,
              | nonviolence aims to create change by making visible that the institutional power’s
              | perceived legitimacy is based on force and not on moral authority or public agree-
              | ment. This is principally a communication activity.
              | 3.1. Rhetoric and Nonviolence
              | Nonviolent rhetoric engages the world and seeks to change it by speaking with
              | and listening to “the other”. Gorsevski finds in a review of rhetorical studies of non-
              | violence that “it remains a marginalized area of research, tending to represent the
              | rhetorics of specific interest groups such as women or minorities, rather than cases
              | of rhetoric of general interest to a wider array of students and scholars” (2012, p.
              | 10).
              | Given the seeming affinity between rhetoric and nonviolence, it is surprising that
              | there has not been more scholarship on the subjects. Gorsevski (2012) offers an
              | analysis of the intersections between theories of nonviolence and rhetoric. She
              | argues “Nonviolent theory shows rhetoricians that language and culture, in a sense

              | Writing…
              | our way of creating and perpetuating our reality, can be devoid of, or impose mini-
              | mal, aggression” (Gorsevski, 2012, p. xxiv). Nonviolent actions are almost always
              | communicative and rhetorical. Speaking, listening, writing, occupying a space, mar-
              | ching, and noncooperation are all rhetorical moves. The people employing them do
              | so to communicate an idea to their supporters, their (perceived) opponents, and the
              | media.
              | Herrick (2013) explains that “rhetorical discourse typically is a response either to
              | a situation or to a previous rhetorical statement” (p. 11). Nhất Hạnh’s concept of
              | compassionate communication and deep listening merges clearly with Herrick’s
              | terminology of rhetoric as “response-making” and “response-inviting” (Herrick,
              | 2013, p. 11). Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s New Rhetoric Project tried to theo-
              | rize a way in which people could argue to gain the adherence of others without re-
              | sorting to force. They wrote that “recourse to argumentation assumes the establish-
              | ment of a community of minds, which while it lasts, excludes the use of violence”
              | (Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969, p. 55). They did not frame their task explicitly
              | as nonviolent rhetoric, but there are clear connections.
              | Very few works in communication and rhetorical studies have looked at Nhất
              | Hạnh. Ucok-Sayrak (2014) compared the ethics of communication in the works of
              | Levinas and Nhất Hạnh finding that in both “frameworks, the ethical response to the
              | Other requires a kind of receptivity beyond the boundaries of rational-discursive
              | thinking and the conventional ‘I’” (p. 262). There have not been studies in rhetoric
              | and communication that directly examine Nhất Hạnh’s ideas about nonviolent
              | communication. We seek to show how Nhất Hạnh’s engaged Buddhism can be read
              | as a rhetorical theory of nonviolence.
              | Nonviolent methods can take many forms, most of which are clearly communi-
              | cative. Sharp (1973) categorizes them as protest and persuasion, noncooperation,
              | and intervention. Though he explicitly includes persuasion in the first group, actions
              | in each of three categories are rhetorical. Certainly protest and persuasion, including
              | speeches, music, and picketing are designed to communicate and persuade. In the
              | second category, noncooperation, actions such as strikes and boycotts serve not only
              | to disrupt normal social and economic activities, but to persuade the public that the
              | values of the nonviolent movement are worthy of attention and superior to those of
              | the opposition. The third category, intervention, includes the actions of sit-ins, hun-
              | ger strikes, and seeking imprisonment. Again, these actions have their principal
              | force as communication events. The pain and possible death of the protestor has no
              | material effect on institutional power. The force of the action is communicative.
              | Martin and Varney (2003) note that nonviolent action “creates meanings among
              | observers, though explanations help to crystallize the purposes of the actions or,
              | semiotically speaking, select out denotations from a range of connotations” (p. 215).
              | These actions garner attention for the movement, demonstrate commitment and
              | credibility, and engage the audience in a reconsideration of the values of those enga-
              | ged in the movement and institutional power.

text          | We often think of persuasion as opponents who try to change the mind of the
              | other. Success is measured by the change of belief. But this rarely happens in prac-
              | tice. How often do we really change our minds about something, particularly
              | something we strongly believe? Nhất Hạnh is not the only one to think about alter-
              | natives to narrow theories of persuasion. Two theories that have attempted this are
              | Gilbert’s coalescent argumentation and Foss and Griffin’s invitational rhetoric.
              | One approach that seeks to move beyond traditional theories of persuasion is
              | Gilbert’s coalescent argumentation. He describes it as
              | a normative ideal that involves the joining together or two disparate claims
              | through recognition and exploration of opposing positions. By uncovering
              | the crucial connection between a claim and the attitudes, beliefs, feelings,
              | values, and needs to which it is connected dispute partners are able to iden-
              | tify points of agreement and disagreement. These points can then be uti-
              | lized to effect coalescence, a joining or merging of divergent positions, by
              | forming the basis for a mutual investigation of non-conflictual options that
              | might otherwise have remained unconsidered. (Gilbert, 1995, p. 837)
              | Rather than attitude change, argumentation often leads to outcomes that “include
              | a negotiated agreement, a compromise, or a realization that further dispute is futile”
              | (Gilbert, 1995, p. 837). This determination requires listening between dispute part-
              | ners and a willingness to speak what they believe deeply. The ability to both listen
              | and speak in this way is reflected in Nhất Hạnh’s ideas of loving speech and deep
              | listening. This approach is challenging given how complex beliefs are.
              | The first step of coalescent argumentation is asking the question “why are we ar-
              | guing?” (Gilbert, 1995, p. 841). “If I do not know what you want, what you believe,
              | what you feel, then it is difficult, to say the least, for me to satisfy or shift those
              | needs through argumentation” (Gilbert, 1995, p. 842). Persuasion is often thought of
              | as taking something (e.g., an arguer takes a point or position away from the other).
              | Gilbert argues that “most analytical tools focus on the desire of the respondent to
              | eliminate, defeat or otherwise invalidate the proponent's reasons. While this can be
              | important in certain circumstances, it should not be the major goal of a respondent,
              | and certainly not at the outset of a dispute” (Gilbert, 1995, p. 842). Nhất Hạnh and
              | coalescent argumentation can be read as viewing argumentation as an opportunity to
              | give things to one another. Those gifts may be a change in attitude, the space to
              | reconsider beliefs, or even just the chance to be heard.
              | Gilbert writes that a claim is like the tip of an iceberg for a much larger, more
              | deeply held position: “To effect persuasion one must impact on the entire position
              | and not just the claim…[The position] is a matrix of beliefs, attitudes, emotions,
              | insights, and values connected to a claim” (1995, pp. 839-840). A critical part of
              | Gilbert’s theory is the recognition that arguers do not always have self-awareness of
              | the depths of their positions. In the way that a person who is tortured may say
              | something they do not believe in order to stop the physical violence, arguers may
              | make claims that they do not believe or are fearful to question if there is a threat of

              | physical or communicative violence. Nhất Hạnh’s approach calls on practitioners to
              | engage their own complicated feelings and to listen to those of others.
              | While most Western rhetorical theorists have thought of rhetoric and persuasion
              | as synonymous, Foss and Griffin (1995), offer an invitational rhetoric that chal-
              | lenges that assumption. It is a rhetoric that is “rooted in equality, immanent value,
              | and self-determination” (p. 5). Nhất Hạnh might say that the invitation stems from
              | an understanding of interbeing. Foss and Griffin highlight other features that would
              | be familiar to Nhất Hạnh including, non-judgement, appreciation, listening, and
              | nonadversarial positioning. Such an approach emphasizes a context in which parti-
              | cipants are not opponents and persuasion is not coercion. In relation to nonviolent
              | rhetoric, Gorsevski (2012) states that “persuasion is not necessarily violent (or even
              | coercive) when it is performed in the context of true nonviolent action. True nonvio-
              | lent action means action that is aimed at resisting oppression, either purposefully or
              | unwittingly” (p. 186).
              | The idea that participants in argumentation are willing to change is both necessa-
              | ry and challenging. Nhất Hạnh (1995) writes:
              | We have to appreciate that truth can be received from outside of—not only
              | within—our own group. If we do not believe that, entering into dialogue
              | would be a waste of time. If we think we monopolize the truth and we still
              | organize a dialogue, it is not authentic. We have to believe that by engaging
              | in dialogue with the other person, we have the possibility of making a
              | change within ourselves, that we can become deeper. Dialogue is not a
              | means for assimilation in the sense that one side expands and incorporates
              | the other into its “self.” Dialogue must be practiced on the basis of “non-
              | self.” We have to allow what is good, beautiful, and meaningful in the
              | other’s tradition to transform us. (p. 9)
              | If we do not believe that we ourselves are capable of changing our beliefs as a
              | result of dialogue and persuasion, then why should we believe that others have this
              | ability or desire? If we think that the “other side” is persuadable (not just that they
              | should be persuadable) is it only because we think that their belief is a weak one,
              | that they do not really believe their stated position, or that they are willing to let go
              | of their belief in exchange for something of greater value? In order to have a dia-
              | logue in which one’s opponent is open to persuasion, we must also be open to such
              | persuasion. The ability to persuade, or be persuaded, requires some realization of
              | non-attachment to views.
              | The persuasive function of nonviolence engages several audiences. In a nonvio-
              | lent action, there is the immediate audience, usually institutional powers or their
              | representatives. A consequence of nonviolent action may be a violent response, and
              | to suffer violence is, itself, a communicative act of nonviolence. In Gandhi’s view
              | “Suffering is infinitely more powerful than the law of the jungle for converting the
              | opponent and opening his ear, which are otherwise shut, to the voice of reason” (as
              | cited in Southern Christian Leadership Conference, p. 2). As a matter of persuasion,

meta          | 83
text          | it may be very difficult to find immediate attitude change. But the audience that may
              | be more open to change is that which views the action from afar. This mediated
              | experience is the goal of much of nonviolent action. In Gandhi’s protest on the Dha-
              | rasana Salt Works in 1930, the greatest change in beliefs about the movement came
              | from those with a mediated experience of the action, particularly an international
              | audience who read about the protests in their newspapers (Martin & Varney, 2003,
              | p. 215).
              | If we transfer Nhất Hạnh’s concepts of interbeing and engaged Buddhism to rhe-
              | toric’s concern with audience, we are left in an interesting place. In traditional Bud-
              | dhism, the self is often seen as the primary rhetorical audience. In Nhất Hạnh’s
              | rhetorical nonviolence, the self and the other are simultaneous audiences. In rhetori-
              | cal studies we are used to talking about multiple audiences for discourse. For Nhất
              | Hạnh, all beings, in fact all creation, is part of the audience for every speech. This
              | includes the speaker as an audience as well. Perelman and Oblrechts-Tyteca (1969)
              | wrote that it “very often happens that discussion with someone else is simply a
              | means we use to see things more clearly ourselves” (p. 41). When we move past the
              | idea of self versus enemy, rhetoric addressed outwardly also has a persuasive effect
              | inwardly. To use violent language when speaking to, or about, the perceived enemy
              | is to perpetuate violence against oneself. This does not, however, take away from
              | persuasion as the main tool of nonviolence.
              | 3. Why nothing less than love?
              | Even for many who accept a nonviolent approach to conflict resolution, the idea
              | of “loving your enemy” can be a difficult concept to embrace. One might think,
              | “Just because I don’t like violence, doesn’t mean I’m ready to love my enemy.”
              | Sharp directly questions the need for a nonviolent ethic that is based in moral ideals
              | like “loving your enemy.” He states that,
              | when understood as a requirement for nonviolent action (rather than a
              | helpful refinement), the demand for “love” for people who have done cruel
              | things may turn people who are justifiably bitter and unable to love their
              | opponents toward violence as the technique most consistent with bitterness
              | and hatred. (Sharp, 2005a, p. 635)
              | In response to Sharp’s casting of “love” as an unnecessary “refinement” of non-
              | violent social movements, critics have explored the limitation of a solely strategic or
              | pragmatic approach to nonviolence to achieve the lasting goals of peace and social
              | justice (Bharadwaj, 1998; Clements, 2015; Braatz, 2014). They point to recent ins-
              | tances in which pragmatic nonviolence was effective at bringing about regime
              | change, but ultimately failed to provide citizens with basic assurances of safety or
              | equality, including the Philippines and Egypt. Braatz (2014) observes that even “a
              | successful civilian resistance movement, one that removes an unpopular repressive
              | regime, is no guarantee of democratic inclusion, social justice, equality of opportuni-

              | Writing…
              | ty, and human rights protections” (p. 5). Braatz goes on to argue that “if the goal is
              | to reduce violence of all types … [then] the principled approach—identifying and
              | rejecting any and all forms of violence—is also the pragmatic one” (2014, p. 11).
              | The strategic approach to nonviolence is very different from what Nhất Hạnh
              | and others who prioritize the pursuit of peace and understanding among people arti-
              | culate. They are not focused on just short term goals of policy or regime change.
              | Gandhi suggested that without love, you cannot really have nonviolence. He said:
              | We can only win over the opponent by love, never by hate. Hate is the sub-
              | tlest form of violence. We cannot be really non-violent and yet have hate in
              | us …Violent non-co-operation only multiplies evil. … As evil can only be
              | sustained by violence, withdrawal of support of evil requires complete abs-
              | tention from violence. (Gandhi, 1971, p. 96)
              | Martin Luther King, Jr. also spoke unequivocally about his commitment to “love our
              | enemies.” King explains that “We never get rid of an enemy by meeting hate with
              | hate; we get rid of an enemy by getting rid of enmity. By its very nature, hate des-
              | troys and tears down; by its very nature, love creates and builds up” (2012, p. 50-
              | 51). Both King and Gandhi are looking beyond just removing current sources of
              | oppression, to how to build communities that make it hard for oppression to take
              | hold.
              | In highlighting the diverse spiritual origins of the concept of “loving your ene-
              | my,” Thích Nhất Hạnh (1995) acknowledges its apparent contradiction: “When
              | Gandhi said that love is the force that can liberate, he meant we have to love our
              | enemy. Even if our enemy is cruel, even if he is crushing us, sowing terror and in-
              | justice, we have to love him. This is the message of Jesus” (p. 84). He says that
              | gaining knowledge and understanding is the key to this challenge: “Understanding a
              | person brings us the power to love and accept him. And the moment we love and
              | accept him, he ceases to be our enemy. To ‘love our enemy’ is impossible, because
              | the moment we love him, he is no longer our enemy” (Nhất Hạnh, 1995, p. 85). For
              | Nhất Hạnh, communication and love are necessary partners in nonviolent practice.
              | This is a different approach from many rhetorical and nonviolence theorists, but
              | there are bridges when we consider the rhetorical value of understanding one’s au-

              | 4. How can you start to love your enemy?
              | Nhất Hạnh also recognizes that it is not obvious to most of us how to cultivate a
              | peaceful presence: “Everyone knows that peace has to begin with oneself, but not
              | many people know how to do it” (as cited in Malkin, 2003). He often uses the image
              | of seeds in ground to illustrate the tendencies that are in each of us. He says that we
              | have both the seeds of love, compassion, and understanding; as well as the seeds of
              | fear, anger and intolerance. According to Nhất Hạnh (2003), “when we know how

meta          | 85
text          | to cultivate the seeds of love, compassion, and understanding in us every day, those
              | seeds become stronger and the seeds of violence and hatred will become weaker and
              | weaker” (p. 2).
              | In his books and lectures, Nhất Hạnh outlines practical steps—including
              | breathing and meditation—that people can take to help transform the seeds of vio-
              | lence. Even as he encourages the cultivation of internal peace, Nhất Hạnh (2003)
              | urges people to actively practice cultivating love and understanding in our interac-
              | tions with others: “There are concrete ways to train ourselves to communicate non-
              | violently so that compassion for one another is awakened and mutual understanding
              | becomes possible again. Speaking and listening with compassion are the essential
              | practices of nonviolent communication” (p. 21). His idea of engaged mindfulness
              | involves engaging in practices that build peace both inside oneself and in the world.
              | One such practice is writing love letters, both to loved ones and to political lea-
              | ders. Nhất Hạnh (1991) refers to letter writing as not just a powerful act of loving
              | speech, but also “a practice of looking deeply” (p. 110). Nhất Hạnh was concerned
              | by his observation of anger and aggression in the American peace movement noting
              | that “People in the peace movement can write very good protest letters, but they are
              | not so skilled at writing love letters” (1991, p. 110). Nhất Hạnh hopes that they
              | could use practices, like writing love letters, to give them a “fresh way of being
              | peace” (1991, p. 110). The letter writing that he encourages is an embodiment of his
              | rhetorical nonviolent approach.
              | 5. Thích Nhất Hạnh’s Love Letter to President Bush
              | As a Buddhist and peace activist, Nhất Hạnh opposes all armed conflict. During
              | the early 2000s, he advocated for the United States to withdraw from the conflict in
              | Iraq. In 2006, he wrote a letter to President George W. Bush about his feelings about
              | the war.1 There are several features of the letter that should be examined. First, the
              | 1 This is the letter Nhất Hạnh wrote to George W. Bush. He sent a handwritten letter to the White House
              | and released a copy to the public.
              | Dear Mr. President,
              | Last night, I saw my brother (who died two weeks ago in the USA) coming back to me in a dream. He
              | was with all his children. He told me, “Let’s go home together.” After a millisecond of hesitation, I told
              | him joyfully, “Ok, let’s go.”
              | Waking up from that dream at 5 am this morning, I thought of the situation in the Middle East; and for the
              | first time, I was able to cry. I cried for a long time, and I felt much better after about one hour. Then I
              | went to the kitchen and made some tea. While making tea, I realized that what my brother had said is
              | true: our home is large enough for all of us. Let us go home as brothers and sisters.
              | Mr. President, I think that if you could allow yourself to cry like I did this morning, you will also feel
              | much better. It is our brothers that we kill over there. They are our brothers, God tells us so, and we also
              | know it. They may not see us as brothers because of their anger, their misunderstanding, and their discri-
              | mination. But with some awakening, we can see things in a different way, and this will allow us to res-
              | pond differently to the situation. I trust God in you; I trust Buddha nature in you.
              | Thank you for reading.
              | In gratitude and with brotherhood,

              | Writing…
              | form of the letter is important. Nhất Hạnh wrote it by hand. The format of the com-
              | munication may contribute to its reception. We write and receive fewer pieces of
              | handwritten mail today. Noam (2005) remarks that the flood of electronic messages
              | may reduce their persuasiveness and that in that environment “the most effective
              | means of communications to an elected official—other than a campaign contribution
              | check—becomes the handwritten letter”. We do not know if President Bush received
              | the letter or was persuaded by it because he did not offer any response. But Bush
              | was not the only audience for the letter. Nhất Hạnh released the letter publically and
              | posted it on his website. This allows anyone who can access it the opportunity to be
              | persuaded by Nhất Hạnh’s words.
              | Nhất Hạnh begins this letter with an intensely personal memory. In this introduc-
              | tion, he is clearly trying to approach Bush as another human, not as a leader or poli-
              | cy maker. Nhất Hạnh (1991) has written of the importance of attempting to engage
              | one’s intended audience. He encourages activists to write letters to leaders “that they
              | will want to read, and not just throw away” (p. 110). To this end, he writes that “the
              | kind of language we use should not turn people off. The President is a person like
              | any of us” (Nhất Hạnh, 1991, p. 110). In recounting his dream of his recently decea-
              | sed brother, Nhất Hạnh is acknowledging the very human nature of both himself and
              | George W. Bush.
              | Also in this anecdote, Nhất Hạnh is recounting a moment of joy. This may be an
              | unexpected emotion in the context of both Nhất Hạnh’s personal loss and the con-
              | flict in the Middle East that he addresses. This reference to his own joyfulness
              | makes sense in the context of his belief that “To suffer is not enough” (Nhất Hạnh,
              | 1987, p. 3). In pursuing an end to war, injustice, and even personal suffering, Nhất
              | Hạnh emphasizes the importance of stopping in order “to be in touch with the won-
              | ders of life” (1987, p. 3). He believes that cultivating the “seeds” of peace and joy
              | within oneself is important to being able to bring peace and joy to the world.
              | When Nhất Hạnh mentions that he “was able to cry,” he is modeling his own
              | ability to acknowledge and take care of his own feelings. He warns that “when we
              | hold back our feelings and ignore our pain, we are committing violence against
              | ourselves,” (Nhất Hạnh, 2003, p. 16). The importance of being aware of, and nurtu-
              | ring, our own suffering is frequently reiterated by Nhất Hạnh as an essential step
              | towards peace. He writes, “The practice of nonviolence is to be here, to be present,
              | and to recognize our own pain or despair” (Nhất Hạnh, 2003, p. 16). He suggests
              | that to “recognize, embrace, and transform” difficult feelings can help us from har-
              | ming ourselves or others (2003, p. 17). Gilbert’s idea of a claim being the tip of an
              | iceberg resonates here. Nhất Hạnh is sharing with Bush his matrix of beliefs and
              | values that support his opposition to war. That sharing may lead to more effective
              | persuasion that engages the communicative partner.

text          | When Nhất Hạnh (2003) states that “our home is large enough for all of us,” and
              | extends an invitation to “go home as brothers and sisters,” (p. 62) he is referring to
              | the concept of interbeing discussed earlier. Nhất Hạnh believes that once individuals
              | realize their “interconnectedness with others,” they will begin to see how their ac-
              | tions affect themselves and “all other life” (2003, p. 62). In the letter’s following
              | paragraph, Nhất Hạnh, continues in this vein by saying that “It is our brothers and
              | sisters that we kill over there” (2003, p. 62). While he draws attention to death and
              | destruction caused by the war, Nhất Hạnh avoids blaming Bush alone, by using the
              | words “we kill.” By communicating in this way, Nhất Hạnh illustrates that, in ac-
              | cord with his belief in interbeing, that he also considers himself part of the cause of
              | this suffering.
              | Nhất Hạnh, conscious of the background and beliefs of his direct audience, ap-
              | peals to Bush as a Christian when he writes that “God tell us so.” In the forward to
              | Living Buddha, Living Christ, David Steindl-Rast (1995), a Catholic Benedictine
              | monk, writes that “From the biblical perspective there is no human being who is not
              | alive with God’s own breath” (p. xiv). In his writing and talking about the intersec-
              | tion of Buddhist and Christian beliefs, Nhất Hạnh offers this relationship of God to
              | all beings as a way for Christians generally, and Bush specifically, to understand
              | interbeing. He also, however, acknowledges the challenge of seeing people as “bro-
              | thers” when you are in conflict with them. In writing about “their anger, their mi-
              | sunderstanding, and their discrimination,” Nhất Hạnh is addressing the issue of
              | understanding. He is modeling for Bush the practice of looking deeply, trying to
              | understand the suffering that leads to violence.
              | Nhất Hạnh concludes his letter on a hopeful note. He clearly believes that trans-
              | formation is possible, and that seeing “things in a different way” can lead to respon-
              | ding “differently to the situation.” While Nhất Hạnh is deeply opposed to Bush’s
              | actions in Iraq and the Middle East, this practice gave him an opportunity to practi-
              | cing his own deep looking and loving speech. In this letter, Nhất Hạnh is both lo-
              | ving his “enemy” and modeling for Bush how one can “love your enemy.”
              | Conclusion
              | Nonviolence, when viewed simply as a strategy to stop or avoid an immediate
              | conflict, can be successful for a time. Thích Nhất Hạnh shows us that nonviolent
              | rhetoric and nonviolent living as a continuing practice are necessary if we are to
              | create a world of peace. To this end, we have outlined what a rhetorical theory of
              | nonviolence looks like from the writings of Nhất Hạnh. His approach asks the non-
              | violent speaker to be concerned with audience, argument, and style. In the sense of
              | interbeing, audiences are composed of the speaker, all who encounter their discourse
              | and in a fundamental way, the whole universe; to harm one is to harm all. When
              | making arguments, we should examine why we hold the positions we do and articu-
              | late them truthfully, but be open to change. Non-attachment to views is central to
              | both engaged Buddhism and persuasion. In terms of style, we must be mindful that
meta          | 88
text          | M. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON, R. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON
              | Writing…
              | language can be violent. Speakers should not just avoid making threats, but ap-
              | proach themselves and their perceived enemy with love. Nhất Hạnh does not offer
              | this as a prescriptive rhetorical theory. Rather these are ideas designed to guide
              | people to speak and listen in way that increases love, decreases violence, and creates
              | the possibility for true peace.
              | If those of us who study rhetoric and communication believe that we can change
              | the world through language and that those efforts are preferable to violence, we
              | should devote more of our scholarly attention to nonviolence. Using violent rhetoric
              | and hating our perceived enemies while advocating for peace is still participating in
              | the culture of war. In many places, nonviolence is the only form of protest accepted
              | by most citizens and political institutions. Its effectiveness can be enhanced through
              | engagement with Nhất Hạnh’s approach of nonviolent communication. The success
              | or failure of nonviolence is not measured in one conflict, one movement, or one
              | time. We return to the ideas of the leaders of principled nonviolence because they
              | have applicability in all contexts, not simply in response to one instance of violence
              | or oppression. It is an ongoing practice that has the potential to save the world.
