              | Diffusion of ISO 9000 Standards and International Trade
              | Investigating the link between ISO 9000 standards and bilateral exports, this
              | paper contributes to the literature on standardization and international trade. A
              | debate exists as to how ISO 9000 impacts trade. First, it has been argued that
              | ISO 9000 is a “common language” that lowers information asymmetries
              | between firms, thus allowing more efficient organization of inter-firm trade.
              | Second, ISO 9000 has been criticized as a means of introducing market-entry
              | barriers and a tariff on international trade. To assess the actual impact we
              | estimate a gravity equation for bilateral exports incorporating ISO 9000
              | adoptions in each country as factors affecting bilateral trade barriers.
              | Endogeneity issues are carefully addressed. To obtain additional insights, we
              | separately estimate an ISO 9000 international diffusion equation. In general, our
              | results support the “common language” hypothesis, i.e., the empirical tests find
              | both domestic and foreign ISO 9000 adoptions to benefit bilateral exports.
              | Moreover, we find evidence for a substitution effect, as ISO 9000 certified firms
              | tend to trade with each other more than with uncertified firms. Consequently,
              | the positive impact of these standards on trade is more pronounced among ISO
              | 9000 abundant countries.

              | ZUSAMMENFASSUNG
              | Die Diffusion von ISO 9000 Normen und der Internationale Handel
              | Das vorliegende Papier ist ein Beitrag zur Literatur über den Zusammenhang
              | zwischen der Standardisierung und dem internationalen Handel, untersucht
              | anhand der Verbindung zwischen der ISO 9000 Normierung und bilateralen
              | Exportumsätzen. Über die Auswirkung von ISO 9000 auf den internationalen
              | Handel existiert eine rege Debatte. Einerseits wurde argumentiert, dass die ISO
              | 9000 Normen eine „gemeinsame Sprache“ bilden, die die Informations-
              | asymmetrie zwischen Unternehmen mindert und dadurch einen effizienteren
              | Handel zwischen ihnen gewährt. Andererseits wurde ISO 9000 kritisiert als ein
              | Mittel zur Einführung eines Marktzugangshemmnisses und als eine Steuer auf
              | den internationalen Handel. Um die tatsächliche Auswirkung zu beurteilen,
              | schätzen wir eine Gravitätsgleichung für die bilateralen Exportumsätze, die die
              | nationalen Einführungszahlen von ISO 9000 als Determinanten der
              | beidseitigen Handelshemmnisse berücksichtigt. Die Endogenitätsproblematik
              | wird sorgfältig behandelt. Um zusätzliche Einsichten zu gewinnen, schätzen wir
              | getrennt eine Gleichung der weltweiten Diffusion von ISO 9000. Unsere
              | Ergebnisse bestätigen im Allgemeinen die Hypothese der „gemeinsamen
              | Sprache“, d.h. die empirischen Überprüfungen stellen fest, dass sich die
              | inländischen sowie auch die ausländischen Einführungszahlen dieser Normen
              | positiv auf die Exportumsätze der Handelspartner auswirken. Außerdem finden
              | wir Anzeichen eines Substitutionseffektes, da die mit ISO 9000 zertifizierten
              | Unternehmen zu mehr Handel mit anderen zertifizierten Unternehmen neigen
              | als mit nicht zertifizierten Unternehmen. Folglich ist die positive Auswirkung der
              | ISO 9000 Normierung auf den Handel zwischen den Ländern mit einer hohen
              | Normierungsquote stärker ausgeprägt.

              | 1. Introduction
              | The main goal of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is to
              | harmonize standards around the world, which, as it is widely claimed, promotes trade and
              | therefore global welfare. Examples of the work done by ISO include technical, environmental,
              | and management standards. ISO 9000 family of standards – often referred to as generic
              | quality management standards – is one of them. The vision of the developers is that
              | (…) through its worldwide acceptance and use, the ISO 9000 family of standards will provide an effective
              | means for improving the performance of individual organizations and providing confidence to people and
              | organizations that products (goods and services) will meet their expectations thereby enhancing trade,
              | global prosperity and individual well-being.1
              | Critics of ISO 9000 claim, however, that it is merely a barrier to market entry and a
              | tariff on international trade. There are valid arguments on both sides. On the one hand, ISO
              | 9000 might be a common language, which lowers informational asymmetry between firms
              | and allows them to organize trade more efficiently. Indeed, the standards emphasize clear and
              | open communication with customers, as well as with suppliers.2 Furthermore, they provide a
              | tool facilitating screening and performance evaluation. Consequently, learning this common
              | language offers an alternative for establishing vertical relations based on long-term
              | relationship and brand reputation. On the other hand, ISO 9000 has been used as a standard
              | against which to assess performance in government procurements and in setting of minimum
              | quality requirements for imports. This raises a concern that the standard is mainly a tool for
              | protecting domestic markets.
              | This paper empirically investigates the impact of ISO 9000 on international trade. We
              | estimate a gravity equation for bilateral trade incorporating ISO 9000 adoptions in each
              | country as factors affecting bilateral trade barriers. As it has been pointed out in the literature,
              | the causality might go both ways. International trade might benefit (suffer) from standards’
              | harmonization, as trade barriers decrease (increase); and standardization process might in turn
              | be determined by intensity of foreign trade, which indicates openness of an economy ( see e.g.
              | Casella, 1996; Moenius, 2000). As a consequence, empirical models of international trade
              | using standardization as an explanatory variable may suffer from endogeneity bias. We

text          | carefully address this issue in the paper. Statistical tests do not reject strict exogeneity of ISO
              | 9000 adoptions in our gravity equation. As we discuss later, however, there are reasons to
              | believe that this result does not hold for other standards. Although, we do not need to
              | endogenize ISO 9000 adoptions for consistency of gravity equation results, we estimate its
              | international diffusion equation to obtain additional insights.
              | The empirical literature investigating the impact of common standards on trade is
              | scarce. In particular, we are not aware of any study that investigates the performance of ISO
              | 9000 in this context. Few existing empirical analyses of ISO 9000 focus on managers’
              | motivation to seek the certification and on market reaction to it. Examples include Anderson
              | et. al. (1999), who find that after controlling for regulatory and customer pressures, providing
              | credible signals of quality assurance to external parties motivates the adoption decision.
              | Further, Docking and Dowen (1999) examine the reaction of the firms’ stock price to the
              | announcement of ISO 9000 registration. They find that, for smaller firms, investors react
              | positively to the announcement and that there was no significant reaction for larger firms.
              | The work by Moenius (2000), looking at the impact of country-specific and bilaterally
              | shared product and process standards on international trade, is probably closest to our work.
              | He finds that both country-specific and shared standards are favorable to trade. Similarly,
              | Swann et al. (1996) report that both international and country-specific product standards
              | promote imports into the U.K. Further, Blind (2001) analyses Switzerland’s trade of
              | measurement and testing products with Germany, France, and the U.K. He finds that the stock
              | of both national and international standards in this sector has a positive impact on the trade
              | flows. In turn, Blind (2002) investigates factors responsible for intensity of standardization in
              | 20 industrial sectors of seven countries. He reports empirical evidence on the positive relation
              | between the stock of national and international standards in a sector and the ratio of exports to
              | total production in that sector.
              | More generally, our work also relates to the strand of literature considering the role of
              | networks in reducing information costs associated with international trade (e.g. Rauch, 1999;
              | Rauch and Trindade, 2002). In our view, the role of ISO 9000 for international trade very
              | much overlaps with the role of ethnic Chinese networks for trade studied by Rauch and
              | Trindade (2002). To the extent that ISO 9000 lowers information and search costs, it also
              | relates to the role of Internet for trade studied by Freund and Weinhold (2004). Neither of
              | these studies, however, discusses the potential endogeneity of networks’ formation.

text          | The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the ISO 9000 family
              | of standards and its role in international trade more in detail. Section 3 provides theoretical
              | models of bilateral trade flows and standard diffusion, which guide our empirical analysis.
              | Data, empirical implementation of the theoretical models, and discussion of the results are
              | presented in section 4. Section 5 concludes.
              | 2. ISO 9000 and its role in international trade
              | The ISO 9000 family of standards is often referred to as generic quality management
              | standards – generic in the sense that they can be implemented by any organization regardless
              | of its size, activity sector, and managerial or national culture. Quality management reflects
              | what the organization does to enhance customer satisfaction by meeting his/her requirements
              | and expectations.3 Compliance with ISO 9000 indicates consistent use of documents and
              | standardized procedures to produce a good or service, for which the customer contracts. In
              | other words, ISO 9000 certifies that the firm’s products conform to specification.
              | The history of ISO 9000 started in 1987 with publication of the ISO 9000 Quality
              | Assurance Standards by a Technical Committee (TC 176) of the International Organization
              | for Standardization (ISO). By the end of 2001, the number of ISO 9000 certificates exceeded
              | half a million in 161 countries around the world, contributing to its reputation as an
              | international reference for quality requirements in business-to-business dealings.4 We treat
              | ISO 9000 as a uniform standard although it consists of a series of nested standards, which
              | evolved over time. The core members of the original family with which firms could actually
              | be certified were ISO 9001, ISO 9002, and ISO 9003. They differed in terms of the quality
              | system elements they covered. The nested nature of these standards allowed firms to
              | accommodate differences in the scope of their operations.5 The 2000 edition of the ISO 9000
              | family replaced these three standards with a single one labeled ISO 9001: 2000. As
              | supplementary standards, the 2000 edition included ISO 9000: 2000, which describes
              | fundamentals and specifies vocabulary for a quality management system, and ISO 9004:
              | 2000, which provides guidelines for performance improvements. Both of them were
              | developed on the basis of previous standards, which they replaced. Given that the core

text          | members of the ISO 9000 family were finally replaced by a single one, our simplifying
              | assumption treating ISO 9000 as a uniform standard seems justified.
              | ISO 9000 adoption is a sovereign decision of each firm; however, they can seek
              | certification only in their home countries. Each country has one government-designed
              | accrediting agency that certifies the competence of third party registrars to conduct ISO 9000
              | quality audits. The registrars are also charged with the issuing of certificates.6 In general,
              | motivations behind the implementation of ISO 9000 could be divided into three main
              | categories: i) compliance with government regulations, ii) ability to enter new forms of
              | vertical relations due to use of a common language, and iii) internal efficiency gains. In fact,
              | all the factors influencing managers to seek ISO 9000 certification identified by Anderson et
              | al. (1999) in a comprehensive review of practitioners journals fall into one of the three
              | categories.
              | The first category stems from the fact that ISO 9000 has been used as a standard
              | against which to assess performance in government procurements and in setting of minimum
              | quality requirements for products that affect public safety. The Single Market Initiative of
              | 1992 initiated by the European Community involves the most noticeable example of such
              | regulations. The public safety argument obliged firms to attain a uniquely designed EC Mark
              | in order to get access to certain markets.7 ISO 9000 was selected as a means to attain the mark
              | in most of the cases. This raises the concern that ISO 9000 can be a barrier to market entry
              | and a tariff on international trade. We relate our empirical findings to potential effects of the
              | regulations.
              | The second category of motivations is the focus of this study. As noted by Bénézech et
              | al. (2001, p. 1396), “the ISO 9000 series can be viewed as a code, a language used by firms to
              | extend their industrial relationship”. Thanks to standardized documentation flow and
              | organizational procedures within certified firm, ISO 9000 provides a screening device that
              | allows other firms to observe and to evaluate its performance. This naturally lowers
              | informational asymmetries between firms. Consequently, ISO 9000 proxies for conformance
              | of the firm’s product to the specification, for which the customer contracts. This leads to
              | lower transaction and search costs in vertical relations between firms. To realize the benefits
              | of ISO 9000, however, both contracting parties should have adopted (i.e. learned) it in the first
              | 6 Ibid.
              | 7 Ibid; depending on the product category, the EC Mark must have been attained till 1992-1995.

text          | place. This is why the common language analogy is appropriate.8 Learning this common
              | language could be viewed as an alternative for establishing vertical relations based on long-
              | term relationship and trust reputation. This explains the potential of ISO 9000 for reducing
              | barriers to market entry and non-tariff barriers to trade.
              | Finally, firms seek ISO 9000 certification to realize efficiency gains. The discipline of
              | documentation and organizational procedures could reduce waste, lower costs, and improve
              | productivity. For example, relying on a survey of ISO 9000 certified firms in the U.S. (sales
              | from $100 million to $500 million), Anderson et al. (1999) report average annual savings of
              | $200,000 due to the certification.
              | The same authors further report that obtaining ISO 9000 certification at a
              | manufacturing site in the U.S. takes from 9 to 28 months and approximately 35-40% of all
              | sites fail the first audit. Beyond time, the actual costs of the standard adoption and
              | certification are also substantial. A medium size manufacturing facility employing 100 people
              | can expect to spend $50,000. For larger firms (sales from $100 million to $500 million), the
              | average cost that the authors report is $300,000. The above discussed potential costs and gains
              | will guide our ISO 9000 diffusion model developed in section 3.2.
              | 3. Economic models
              | 3.1 International trade flows
              | The standard empirical framework used to predict international trade flows is the
              | gravity equation. In a simple form, which explains its name, the equation reads
              | where Vij is value of exports from country i to country j, Yi and Yj are their economic masses
              | often measured by GDP or GNP, Dij is a measure of the distance between them, and A is a
              | constant of proportionality.9 Attractiveness of the gravity equation originally stems from its
              | empirical explanatory power. Recent developments, however, show that the equation can also
              | 8 We give the common language hypothesis a slightly different spin than Bénézech et al. (2001). They
              | concentrate rather on the role of ISO 9000 as a means to codify the knowledge within a firm.
              | 9 Some empirical studies, in which gravity equation for trade is not theoretically motivated, often define Vij as
              | bilateral trade flows rather than exports alone.

              | be theoretically motivated, in particular, in the context of classical Heckscher-Ohlin
              | framework, as presented by Deardorff (1998). He shows that in a frictionless world – i.e.
              | without transport costs and other impediments to trade – under some mild assumptions,
              | bilateral exports are given on average by (1) with constant of proportionality A = 1/Yw, where
              | Yw stands for world income. He argues also that the tendency of high-income consumers to
              | consume larger budget share of capital-intensive goods will lead high-income/capital-
              | abundant countries to trade more than average with each other and less than average with low-
              | income/labor-abundant countries. This would motivate inclusion of per capita income in the
              | gravity equation, as is often the case in empirical literature.
              | In the real world however, trade is impeded due to transportation costs, tariffs and
              | other non-tariff barriers to trade. Anderson and Wincoop (2003) derive a particularly elegant
              | gravity equation for bilateral exports with trade barriers. Their work falls under the stream of
              | research that – in contrast to the classical Heckscher-Ohlin framework – assumes product
              | differentiation by the place of origin. The key result of Anderson and Wincoop (2003) is that
              | the distance between countries in (1) Dij is determined by relative trade barriers. That is, it
              | directly depends on bilateral trade barriers between i and j and indirectly on bilateral trade
              | barriers between every other pair of countries. Unfortunately, empirical implementation of the
              | model is troublesome, as the closed-form solution for Dij in terms of all bilateral trade barriers
              | does not exist. Moreover, the authors show uniqueness of the implicit solution only for
              | symmetric trade barriers.10
              | As we have already argued, ISO 9000 can be understood as a common language,
              | adoption of which allows firms to lower the transaction and search costs. We will assume that,
              | by lowering these costs, adoptions of the standard in both country i and country j will
              | decrease their bilateral trade barriers. Section 4.2 on empirical implementation of the model
              | presents that in more detail.
              | 3.2 ISO 9000 diffusion
              | Our modeling of the ISO 9000 adoption process is driven by the common language
              | hypothesis, as explained before. This hypothesis naturally leads to network effects in the
              | adoption process, meaning that the value of certification for a firm depends on the total
              | number of certified firms. Intuitively, the more ISO 9000 certified firms the bigger the pool of
              | 10 I.e. barriers to exports form i to j are equal barriers to exports from j to i.

              | certified firm. Since we are interested in the link between ISO 9000 and international trade,
              | the relevance of foreign adoptions of the standard for the home country adopters is of crucial
              | importance. We want to test whether economic distance between countries in terms of trade
              | related factors matters for the foreign adoptions’ relevance. Finding such relationship would
              | give us additional insight about the role of ISO 9000 in international trade.
              | To facilitate the analysis we apply the model developed by Grajek (2002, 2003). It
              | allows us to derive structural country-specific diffusion equations from adoption decisions of
              | individual firms in each country. We assume that in each country i = 1, 2, …, I there is an
              | infinite number of heterogeneous firms, which instantaneously decide whether to adopt ISO
              | 9000 or not. The adoption decision is influenced by the firm-specific intrinsic valuation of the
              | standard, denoted by vi, which corresponds to the net efficiency gains that the firm realizes
              | after the adoption. Another factor influencing the adoption decision is the network size of
              | certified firms at time t denoted by xi(t). Network effects arise in the adoption of ISO 9000
              | due to potentially more efficient contracting among the certified firms. The efficiency gains
              | and network effects together shape the net instantaneous benefits of ISO 9000 adoption,
              | which for simplicity takes the following functional form
              | u(vi,xi(t)) = vi + cxi(t) + dxi2(t),
              | where c and d are parameters that capture the extent of network effects. The squared network
              | size term in (2) accounts for diminishing marginal network effect, as is usually assumed in the
              | theoretical literature. The costs of ISO 9000 adoption consist of a sunk investment in the
              | reorganization of the firm qi and an instantaneous audit fee pi, both of which are assumed to
              | be constant over time. The outside option is not to adopt and brings no benefits.
              | Firms maximize the net benefits adopting ISO 9000 when the present value of the
              | stream of future benefits exceeds the present value of the costs. As shown in appendix 6.1, we
              | can calculate the net-of-cost intrinsic valuation of indifferent firm in country i at time t,
              | denoted as v~i*,t , from the following first order condition
              | v~i*,t + cxi (t −δ ) + dxi2 (t −δ ) = 0 .

              | The lag of network size δ in (3) is crucial for the dynamic properties of the model. It can be
              | motivated by excessive optimism of the firms regarding time needed to implement the
              | standard in their own sites. In fact, as we point out in section 2, the adoption process takes
              | time and large share of firms fails the first audit.
              | Assume that the net-of-cost intrinsic valuations in each country – v~i,t – are uniformly
              | distributed over an interval (-∞, ai] with some density bi. Integrating over all firms with
              | intrinsic valuation higher than v~i*,t , we obtain the equilibrium number of adopters in each
              | country
              | yi (t) = (ai + cxi (t − δ ) + dxi2 (t))bi .
              | The final step in setting up the model is to define the relevant network for ISO 9000
              | adopters in each country. We are not going to differentiate the firms in a given country in
              | terms of their cooperation prospects with each other. Instead, we want to emphasize the
              | difference between the foreign and the domestic firms. Therefore, we define the network size
              | of ISO 9000 adopters as
              | xi (t) = yi (t) + ∑ wij y j (t) ,

              | (4)
              | (5)
              | where wij reflects the relative importance of country j adopters for country i adopters. Since
              | we expect that foreign markets are relevant for the adoption decisions of domestic firms, we
              | are going to relate wij to bilateral trade between i and j in the next section. The general idea is
              | that the intensity of trade indicates closeness of the economies, hence the relevance of foreign
              | firms as business partners for the domestic firms.
              | Finally, substituting (5) in (4), we arrive at the following adoption equation

text          | 4. Empirical model
              | 4.1 Data
              | Data on ISO 9000 adoptions comes from ISO (2002). Bilateral exports are taken from
              | the UN Commodity Trade Statistics Database (Comtrade), and GDP and population figures
              | come from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. The data ranges over 1995-2001 and
              | covers 101 countries. The sample is restricted to this period, because the main variable of
              | interest – ISO 9000 adoptions – is not available prior to 1995. Table 1 lists the countries
              | included in this study together with the number of firms that adopted ISO 9000 standard till
              | the end of 2001 in each of the countries. Summary statistics of the variables used in the
              | estimations are given in table 2.
              | A distinctive feature of this study is its particularly wide coverage of countries. In fact,
              | our sample covers approximately 80% of the world trade and 99% of the world ISO 9000
              | adoptions. A primary reason for this is that the adoptions of ISO 9000 in each country depend
              | on the world diffusion of the standard, as predicted by equation (6). Therefore, the smaller the
              | coverage of the sample, the more sever is the concern about omitted variable bias in the
              | estimates. Additionally, inclusion of the less developed countries, for which the trade barriers
              | aspect of ISO 9000 is potentially more severe, is important for the generality of our results. In
              | the context of gravity equation for trade, the wide coverage of countries might seem
              | problematic. The theories of trade in imperfect substitutes, which were the first to justify the
              | gravity model, were thought to apply only to the industrialized countries. However, as found
              | by Hummels and Levinsohn (1995), the model works equally well for the larger set of
              | countries.11
              | 4.2 Implementation of gravity equation for trade
              | In our empirical implementation of gravity equation, we apply panel data techniques,
              | which have the advantage over cross-section estimations that they can capture all time
              | invariant trade determinants by means of country-pair specific effects. This is very useful,
              | since the trade barriers in gravity models are usually difficult to quantify, as they might
              | consist of tariff barriers, transportation costs, information costs, etc., some of which are not
              | even observable. Among many variables proposed by researchers to approximate the trade

text          | barriers, there are geographical distance, linguistic and colonial ties, membership in trade
              | agreements and monetary unions, and common borders. To the extent that these variables are
              | time invariant, which is very likely given the relatively short time span of our data, the
              | country-pair specific effects will account for them. A particular ingredient of the trade barriers
              | we consider are search and transaction costs. According to the main hypothesis of this paper,
              | they can be lowered for firms that invested in learning of the common language – ISO 9000.
              | As it is commonly assumed, the trade barriers are approximated by a log-linear function.
              | Then, our specification of the trade barriers in (1) reads12
              | Dijt −1 = eηij (1 + ISOit )δ1 (1 + ISO jt )δ 2 .
              | According to (7) the lack of ISO 9000 awarded firms in both countries i and j simplifies the
              | measure of the bilateral trade barriers to a function of country-pair specific effect. Since, we
              | do not impose symmetry on the trade barriers, ηij is in fact importer-exporter specific. This
              | asymmetry is going to be important later on, because it allows us to distinguish the distance to
              | foreign customer (importer) from the distance to foreign supplier (exporter) from the domestic
              | firm viewpoint. Unilateral adoptions of ISO 9000 affect average trade barriers only
              | marginally.13 Bilateral adoptions multiply this effect, as follows from our interpretation of
              | ISO 9000 as a common language. For the sake of generality, we do not restrict the parameters
              | δ1 and δ2 to be equal, although this would fit our common-language hypothesis.
              | Then, after substituting the measures of economic masses and the constant of
              | proportionality in (1) with specific functions of the observables, the gravity equation that we
              | estimate becomes

              | ,
              | where Xijt denotes exports from country i to country j in year t.14 We do not restrict the
              | parameters on countries’ GDP – β1 and β2 – to be equal. We also include POP variable, which
              | measures the countries’ population in millions. The reason for that is to capture the tendency
              | 12 As discussed in previous section, the measure of distance between two countries Dij could be broadly
              | interpreted as the measure of trade barriers between them.
              | 13 We would like to stress that specification (7) describes average bilateral trade barriers, since the trade barriers
              | faced by ISO 9000 certified firms and non certified firms differ.
              | 14 In equation (8), a small technical difficulty arises, because of zero-valued entries in bilateral exports Xijt.

              | and εijt is a usual i.i.d. error term.
              | 4.3 Implementation of ISO 9000 diffusion equation
              | Now, we turn to the empirical implementation of the ISO 9000 adoption equation (6).
              | As already mentioned, we are mainly interested in the relevance of international markets for
              | the adoption decisions of domestic firms. Our assumption, which follows from the common-
              | language hypothesis, is that ISO adoptions in close economies reinforce each other relatively
              | more than ISO adoptions in distant economies. There are two natural candidates for
              | measuring this economic closeness/distance; intensity of bilateral trade and bilateral trade
              | barriers. In the context of gravity equation (8), the difference between the two is that intensity
              | of bilateral trade depends on the countries’ economic masses and some unobserved factors
              | captured by the error term on top of the bilateral trade barriers.
              | These two measures of economic distance differ also in terms of the econometric
              | treatment of the models they imply. The trade intensity measure obviously leads to
              | endogeneity of ISO 9000 variables in the gravity equation (8), whereas trade barriers measure
              | does not. Testing for the endogeneity of ISO 9000 in the gravity equation yields then a way to
              | discriminate between them.
              | Here, we proceed assuming that bilateral trade barriers are the relevant measure of
              | economic distance in the context of ISO 9000 adoptions. In other words, we assume that the
              | relevance of a foreign ISO adoption for domestic firms does not depend on the size of foreign
              | economy in which the adoption occurs. This is justified by the fact the ISO 9000 adoptions
              | take place at the individual firm level, as opposed to other – e.g. technical – standards, which
              | are usually adopted at the industry or nation level. Clearly, the size of the economy is more
              | relevant in the latter than in the former case. Our specification of the economic closeness then
              | reads
              | wij = w1eηij + w eη ji ,

              | in (8). Since ηij (ηji) reflects the barriers to exports from i to j (from j to i) specification (9)
              | distinguishes the distance to foreign customers – weighted by w1 – from the distance to
              | foreign suppliers – weighted by w2. In fact, estimation of the parameters w1 and w2 drives our
              | interest in the ISO 9000 adoption equation. Positive values of w1 and/or w2 would suggest that
              | the firms’ adoption decisions are indeed affected by the number of potential foreign customers
              | and/or suppliers certified with ISO 9000.
              | We also need to relate country-specific parameters of the types’ distribution ai and bi
              | to some observables in order to avoid estimation of excessive number of parameters in (6).
              | One could expect that bi, which reflects the number of firms with a given efficiency gains
              | prospects from ISO 9000 adoption, depends on the total number of firms in country i, which
              | in turn positively correlates with the GDP of that country. Similarly, one could argue that ai,
              | the maximum realizable efficiency gains across firms in country i, depends on the country’s
              | GDP. The rationale is that the efficiency gains due to ISO 9000 adoptions increase with the
              | firm size – so ai most probably reflects the efficiency gains of the largest firms in the country
              | – and the world largest firms are located in the richest countries. We are going to relate ai and
              | bi to the country’s GDP one at a time to keep the model as simple as possible. This leads us to
              | the following specifications
              | and

              | 4.4 Discussion of the results
              | First, we estimate (8) by fixed effects (FE). Typically, researchers report FE estimation
              | results along with random-effects (RE) results. The advantage of FE estimation over RE
              | estimation is that consistency in the former does not rely on orthogonality between the
              | country-pair specific effects ηij and all the other explanatory variables.18 We skip the RE
              | estimation, since we expect the adoptions of ISO in country i to depend on the economic
              | 16 Note that in contrast to (6), time in (11) is treated as discrete variable. As a consequence, δ in (6) becomes
              | “one period” in (11).
              | 17 The reason why we choose this particular normalization is merely that the order of magnitude of coefficients
              | in (11) and (11’) is not too diverse. This makes exposition of the estimation results look nicer.
              | 18 We follow the approach in Wooldridge (2002, p. 251–252), that FE and RE correspond to the assumptions we
              | are willing to impose on unobserved effects ηij in order to estimate the model rather than to their deterministic or
              | stochastic nature.

text          | distance to each trade partner indicated by ηij. The FE estimation results are presented in
              | table 3.
              | The first three columns (1) – (3) contain results of the regressions, in which we
              | exclude some of the explanatory variables and column (4) corresponds to the regression with
              | the full set of covariates. We see that estimated coefficients vary only marginally across these
              | different specifications. In general, we find the coefficient on countries’ own income β1 and
              | the coefficient on partner’s income β2 to lie about 0,3 and 0,7 respectively. Moreover, the
              | coefficients on population γ1 and γ2 tend to be of the same magnitude with reversed sign as
              | income coefficients. These estimates imply that, in contrast to theoretical prediction and the
              | results from cross-sectional studies (see e.g. Frankel et al., 1997, table 4.2 and table B6.6),
              | trade is almost entirely driven by countries’ income per capita. Glick and Rose (2002), who
              | also apply FE estimation, report findings, which are similar to ours (see table 4 in there).
              | The next four regressions (5) – (8) in table 3 augment the first four regressions by
              | inclusion of the leading explanatory variables in order to test the strict exogeneity assumption,
              | as suggested by Wooldridge (2002, p. 285). The null hypothesis of the Wald test reported in
              | table 3 is that coefficients on the leading explanatory variables equal zero. We see that the
              | Wald test rejects the null – and thereby strict exogeneity of the explanatory variables – in all
              | four cases at very high significance. Without strict exogeneity, the FE estimators become
              | inconsistent, so the estimates of the gravity equation coefficients in table 3 can be misleading.
              | We believe that the reason why strict exogeneity failed in the FE estimations is that
              | macroeconomic indicators like exports and GDP tend to be trending variables. This is also
              | true for population and ISO adoptions variables. As is well known from the time series
              | literature, simple OLS is likely to deliver spurious correlations between trending variables.
              | The most straightforward remedy for that is to use first differencing (FD) estimation.
              | Table 4 reports the results of the same exercise, as in table 3, using FD estimation.
              | Again, we see that the estimated coefficients of the gravity equation are stable across different
              | specifications. However, the estimates changed in comparison to the FE results. The most
              | noticeable change concerns population variables. The coefficient on country’s own population
              | γ1 changed sign to positive and the coefficient on partner’s population γ2 decreased in
              | magnitude. Both coefficients are now statistically insignificant, which is in contrast to the
              | findings of cross-sectional studies. The reason for this discrepancy might be that the intended
              | effect of countries’ income per capita on trade is already captured by the country-pair specific
              | effects ηij. This is in line with the Anderson and Marcouiller’s (2002) alternative explanation
meta          | 14
text          | of why capital-abundant countries trade disproportionately with each other. They argue that
              | strong institutions support trade security, which can be plausibly treated as constant in our
              | data.
              | Given the interpretation, that country-specific effects absorb the impact of per capita
              | income, the coefficient on partner’s GDP in table 4, which equals roughly 0,77, corresponds
              | well to the findings of cross-sectional studies. The coefficient on own GDP is however about
              | 10 times smaller and only marginally significant.19 The most important indicator, which gives
              | us some confidence about plausibility of our results, is the Wald test. It does not reject strict
              | exogeneity of the covariates in first differences in the regressions without population variables
              | (column 13 and 15 in table 4).
              | Finally, we turn to the impact of ISO-9000-adoptions’ variables, which are the focus
              | of our study. The FD estimates are lower than the FE estimates, but still significant at the 5%
              | level. The coefficients on own and partner’s adoptions equal 0,027 and –0,026 respectively.
              | This means that a 10% increase in the number of firms awarded with ISO 9000 certificates in
              | a country leads on average to 0,27% increase in bilateral exports and 0,26% decrease in
              | bilateral imports of that country. These results provide an empirical evidence for the role ISO
              | 9000 plays in international trade, although they are not fully in line with our expectations. The
              | common language hypothesis, as we stated it, suggests that bilateral trade flows should rise
              | with both, exporter’s and importer’s, adoptions, since they both contribute to the number of
              | potentially more efficient business links. This line of argument, however, does not take into
              | account the possibility of substitution between suppliers, i.e. exporters in this case. Freund
              | and Weinhold (2004) argue along the same lines interpreting their findings on impact of the
              | Internet on bilateral trade. Also, Anderson and Wincoop (2003) point to the fact that bilateral
              | trade flows depend on trade barriers between all trading parties.20 In our specification of the
              | gravity model, concentration of ISO 9000 adoptions in few countries around the world could
              | explain falling average bilateral imports with the number of adoptions. In fact, the OECD
              | members (30 out of 101 countries in our sample) account for 75% of ISO 9000 adoptions in
              | table 1.
              | To explore further the substitution effect of ISO 9000 on international trade we restrict
              | our sample to the OECD countries and rerun the FD estimations. The results are reported in
              | table 5. Again, the population variables proved to be insignificant and cause endogeneity
              | 19 Freund and Weinhold (2004) also report insignificant FD estimate of own GDP coefficient in their gravity
              | equation for exports. Moreover they find the coefficient on partner’s GDP to lie just slightly above 0,10 (see
              | table 3 in there).
              | 20 See the discussion in section 3.1.

text          | problems. Coefficients on own and partner’s GDP are higher than for the whole sample
              | roughly by 0,1 and 0,2 respectively and highly significant. Coefficients on own and partner’s
              | ISO 9000 adoptions are also significant and amount to 0,063 and 0,036 respectively. This
              | supports the substitution effects hypothesis. Bilateral exports between ISO 9000 abundant
              | countries indeed increase with both domestic and foreign adoptions. These results, however,
              | should be treated with caution, because the Wald test rejects strict exogeneity even in the
              | regressions without population variables (columns 21 and 23 in table 5). Now, the GDP
              | variables are responsible for the rejection. There are good reasons to believe that the
              | endogeneity of GDP in these regressions is merely a statistical phenomenon and that it does
              | not significantly bias the results. First, the inclusion of variables in levels does not
              | significantly change the coefficients on variables in differences. Second, Hummels and
              | Levinsohn (1995) report that correcting for the endogeneity of GDP with instrumental
              | variables makes very little difference.
              | As we mentioned in section 2, critics of ISO 9000 reasonably argue that the standard is
              | actually a barrier to trade, since it has been used as a tool for introducing import restrictions.
              | In fact, the positive effect of domestic ISO 9000 adoptions on exports, that we found, could be
              | explained by increasing access to the regulated markets. However, the impact of domestic
              | adoptions on imports, that we found, cannot be explained by the trade barrier hypothesis. In
              | particular, the finding that imports increase with domestic ISO 9000 adoptions within OECD
              | countries cannot be supported by this hypothesis. The reversed relation in the full sample
              | might be due to the use of ISO 9000 in introducing import restrictions, however, under
              | additional assumption that the restrictions increases with domestic ISO 9000 adoptions.21
              | Estimation results of the ISO 9000 diffusion equation provide additional insights about
              | the link between the standards and international trade. To estimate (11) and (11’) we follow
              | the general method of moments (GMM) approach for linear dynamic panel data models
              | proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991). By doing so, we allow for additional unobserved
              | heterogeneity on top of (11) and (11’). This unobserved heterogeneity accounts for
              | institutional factors, like the national accrediting agencies, which could either spur or hamper
              | the diffusion process.
              | To obtain linear models we multiply out the terms in the structural equations (11) and
              | (11’). By multiplying out the terms, the parameters ω1 and ω2 – the transformed weights in
              | 21 Since the panel data estimation techniques we use provide time-series evidence, because cross-section
              | differentiation is captured by country-pair specific effects, this assumption is much more heroic that it might
              | seem.
meta          | 16
text          | our measure of economic closeness (9) – become overidentified. This allows us to test the
              | underlying structure of the empirical diffusion equations. The estimated coefficients of the
              | linearized equations (11) and (11’) are reported in table 6, in columns (25) and (25’)
              | respectively.22 Except for the lagged dependent variable, all the regressors are treated as
              | strictly exogenous. We see that both regressions perform reasonably well in statistical sense,
              | as indicated by the Sargan and the Arellano-Bond test statistics at the bottom of the table. The
              | underlying economic structure of both regressions (25) and (25’) is, however, rejected by the
              | S
              | data. According to the structural equation (11), the ratio of coefficients on ΣISO i(t-1) and
              | S
              | ISOi(t-1) in the regression (25) should be equal to the ratio of coefficients on GDPitΣISO i(t-1)
              | and GDPitISOi(t-1), because both ratios identify the same parameter ω2. Yet, the ratios have
              | opposite signs. Similarly, the equation (11’) predicts that the ratio of coefficients on
              | (ΣISOCi(t-1))2 and ISO2i(t-1) in the regression (25’) should be equal to the squared ratio of
              | coefficients on ΣISOCi(t-1) and ISOi(t-1), since they identify (ω2)2. But, the first ratio is
              | negative.23 Therefore, we are going to treat the results as coming from a reduced form
              | approach and limit the discussion to pointing out major correlation patterns.
              | The results of the regressions (25) and (25’) suggest in general that ISO 9000
              | adoptions in each country are positively related to the market size measured by the country’s
              | GDP. The adoptions also exhibit significant inertia, as indicated by the coefficients on the
              | lagged dependent variable. Since we are mostly interested in the foreign trade considerations
              | in the adoption decisions of firms, the crucial result in table 6 are the coefficients on the
              | indices of foreign customers’ adoptions and foreign suppliers’ adoptions. We find that
              | domestic ISO 9000 adoptions are positively related to foreign customers’ adoptions, as
              | expected. In contrast, foreign suppliers’ adoptions are not or weakly negatively correlated
              | with domestic adoptions depending on the specification. In other words, the diffusion of ISO
              | 9000 seems to proceed from customers to suppliers and not the other way around, at least in
              | the international context. This asymmetry does not necessarily contradict our common
              | language hypothesis. It might reflect the fact that business customers are able to benefit from
              | ISO 9000 without actually being certified, as someone, who understands a language without
              | having passed exams that certify that. At the same time, certified suppliers might not care
              | about certification of the customers, if their relations are already established.
              | 22 In the regression (25) we additionally assumed that d = 0 in (11). Without this assumption the main
              | coefficients of the model turned out to be insignificant and the Arellano-Bond test indicated second-order
              | autocorrelation in the residuals. The likely reason for this is the multi-collinearity of the explanatory variables.
              | 23 We also carried out formal Wald-type tests, which confirm this intuitive argumentation.
meta          | 17
text          | To check the robustness of these findings, we perform additional two regressions (26)
              | and (26’), in which the indices of foreign ISO 9000 adoptions in (25) and (25’) are replaced
              | with simple unweighted sum of foreign adoptions. The coefficients on the unweighted foreign
              | adoptions are much less significant than those on the indices of foreign adoptions in the
              | previous regressions. In other words, our indices are much better predictors of domestic
              | adoptions than is the unweighted sum. This gives us some confidence in the effects of foreign
              | trade considerations on domestic adoptions we found in (25) and (25’).
              | 5. Conclusions
              | In this paper, we empirically assess the link between the ISO 9000 family of standards
              | and international trade. According to the vision of its developers, ISO 9000 should provide
              | confidence to people and organizations that products will meet their expectations, thereby
              | enhancing trade and global welfare. In contrast, its critics claim that it is merely a barrier to
              | market entry and a tariff on international trade.
              | Our modeling strategy is to look at the impact of ISO 9000 adoptions on bilateral trade
              | flows between countries. We estimate a gravity equation for bilateral exports using data on
              | 101 countries over 1995-2001. To obtain additional evidence, we estimate an international
              | ISO 9000 diffusion equation and test whether the number of certified foreign trade partners
              | plays a role in the domestic firms’ adoption decisions.
              | Using the full sample, we find that domestic ISO 9000 adoptions spur bilateral exports
              | and hamper bilateral imports. In the sample restricted to the OECD countries, however, the
              | domestic adoptions are positively related to both bilateral exports and imports. Additionally,
              | we find empirical evidence on the positive effect of foreign customers’ adoptions of ISO 9000
              | on domestic adoptions.
              | In general, these findings suggest that the ISO 9000 standards have indeed significant
              | positive impact on international trade. They are consistent with the common language
              | hypothesis, which states that ISO 9000 lowers informational asymmetry between firms and
              | allows them to organize vertical relations more efficiently. The negative effect of ISO 9000
              | adoptions on bilateral imports in the full sample can be explained by a substitution effect, as
              | ISO 9000 certified firms tend to trade with each other more than with uncertified firms. Since
meta          | 18
text          | domestic certified firms are likely to choose other certified firms as suppliers, the average
              | bilateral imports from all trade partners will fall with domestic adoptions if the concentration
              | of adoptions around the world is high enough.
              | The hypothesis that ISO 9000, as a tool for introducing import restrictions, is a barrier
              | to international trade is not able to explain our empirical findings, although we cannot reject
              | it. The substitution effect we pointed out might be, however, another way, in which ISO 9000
              | constitutes an effective trade barrier. If the diffusion of ISO 9000 in the less developed
              | countries remains sluggish – e.g. due to weak institutional framework – the benefits of ISO
              | 9000 envisioned by its developers will stay in the developed countries’ domain.
              | 6. Appendices
              | 6.1 Optimal timing of ISO 9000 adoption
              | We assume that once the standard is adopted, it yields the infinite stream of future
              | benefits. The present value of the stream of benefits can be written as
              | where ρ is a common instantaneous discount rate. The cost of adoption consists of the sunk
              | investment in reorganization of the firm qi and the instantaneous audit fee pi, both of which
              | are assumed to be constant over time. We write the present value of the cost as
              | ∞
              | V (vi , xi (t), t) = ∫ e−ρsu(vi , xi (s))ds ,
              | t
              | ∞
              | C(qi , pi , t) = e−ρt qi + ∫t e−ρs pi ds .
              | mtax[V (vi , xi (t), t) − C(qi , pi , t)].
              | The optimal timing of adoption involves solving the following maximization problem
              | Assuming that problem (14) is concave, we obtain the intrinsic valuation of the indifferent
              | firm vi,t* as the solution to

              | (13)
              | (14)
              | ddt V (vi*,t , xi (t), t) − ddt C(qi , pi , t) = 0 ,
              | which simplifies to
              | u(vi*,t , xi (t)) − ρqi − pi = 0 .
              | Now, substituting benefit function (2) in (16) we finally obtain
              | v~i*,t + cxi (t) + dxi2 (t) = 0 ,

              | (16)
              | (17)
              | (18)
              | where v~i*,t = vi*,t − ρqi − pi denotes the net-of-cost intrinsic valuation of indifferent firms.
              | Further, we modify solution (17) introducing a lag δ into the network size. The lag is crucial
              | for identification in this model (see Grajek, 2002). In the context of ISO 9000 adoption
              | decision, the lag can be motivated by an excessive optimism of firms regarding the time
              | needed to implement the standard. The fact that firms obtain certification later than implied by
              | (17) leads to the modified first order condition
              | v~i*,t + cxi (t −δ ) + dxi2 (t −δ ) = 0 .
              | Note that deriving (17) we assumed that the firms have perfect knowledge about the future
              | diffusion of network. This assumption carries over to (18). In other words, the firms know
              | that the others are overoptimistic.
