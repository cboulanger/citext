              | The use of coactors as non-group controls in prior social compensation research has left open
              | the possibility that the effect might artifactually have resulted from a confound between work
              | condition (Coaction vs. Collective) and the opportunity to make performance comparisons. A
              | direct empirical test of this alternative, artifactual explanation is reported. Its results contradict
              | that explanation and suggest that the use of coactors as controls has, if anything, resulted in an
              | underestimation of the magnitude of the social compensation effect. It is argued that multiple
              | alternative non-group performance baselines can be informative for analyzing group motivation
              | effects.

              | OVER the past 25 years there have been many
              | empirical demonstrations of motivation losses
              | or social loaﬁng in small performance groups
              | (see Karau & Williams, 1993; Shepperd, 1993,
              | for reviews). However, in the last decade or so,
              | a handful of studies (e.g. Erev, Bornstein, &
              | Galili, 1993; Hertel, Kerr, & Messè, 2000;
              | Kerr & MacCoun, 1984; Stroebe, Diehl, &
              | Abakoumkin, 1996) have documented group
              | motivation gain phenomena—that is, higher task
              | motivation within a group performance context
              | than within a comparable individual perform-
              | ance context. While empirical demonstrations
              | of motivation gains are rather rare (Hertel
              | et al., 2000), the social compensation effect is a
              | noteworthy example of one of the earliest and
              | most thoroughly studied of such phenomena
              | (e.g. Williams & Karau, 1991; Karau & Williams,
              | 1997; Hart, Bridgett, & Karau, 2001).
              | Social compensation occurs when ‘. . . indi-
              | viduals increase their efforts on collective tasks
              | to compensate for the anticipated poor per-
              | formance of other group members’ (Karau &
              | Williams, 1997, p. 158). In the generic social
              | compensation study, subjects work at a simple,
              | effort-sensitive task1 (e.g. writing down as many
              | uses for a common object as possible) either in
              | a coacting pair (who are not interdependent

              | formance, but simply work in one another’s
              | presence) or within a cooperative dyad (collec-
              | tive condition). The group task is (a) additive
              | (i.e. the group score is the simple sum of the
              | group members’ individual—but supposedly
              | unidentiﬁable—scores; Steiner, 1972) and (b)
              | information reducing (i.e. it is not possible to
              | identify the individual group members’ contri-
              | butions from the group performance; Davis,
              | 1969). These are precisely the conditions under
              | which early social loaﬁng research (e.g. Latané,
              | Williams, & Harkins, 1979) had found and
              | would predict less effort in the collective con-
              | dition. And indeed, when one receives pre-
              | performance information suggesting that one’s
              | partner is quite capable at the task (e.g. will
              | exert a high level of effort (Williams & Karau,
              | 1991, Experiment 2), or has high task ability
              | (Williams & Karau, 1991, Experiment 3)), this
              | is exactly what is observed (see the left sides of
              | Figure 1a and 1b, which reproduce the results
              | of two of Williams & Karau’s early social com-
              | pensation studies). However, when feedback
              | suggests that one’s partner is very incapable, a
              | rather different pattern obtains (see the right
              | sides of Figure 1a and 1b). In the collective con-
              | dition, a good group performance can only be
              | achieved if one works extra hard to compensate
              | for the anticipated poor performance by one’s
              | teammate; it is under these conditions that the
              | social loaﬁng effect is reversed and the social
              | compensation effect is observed.
              | This basic pattern has been replicated several
              | times (e.g. Karau & Williams, 1997; Hart et al.,
              | 2001) and appears to be robust. However, the
              | design of these studies introduced a potential
              | confound that raises an alternative, artifactual
              | explanation for this social compensation effect.
              | The collective versus coactive contrast is
              | intended to—and indeed does—compare a
              | particular type of group performance (viz. per-
              | formers are interdependent and the nature of
              | that interdependence permits one group
              | member to compensate through his/her efforts
              | for an expected incapacity of a teammate) with
              | a corresponding individual performance (viz.
              | performers are independent and cannot affect
              | one another’s score or outcome through their
meta          | 432
text          | own level of performance). A coaction control
              | condition has typically been used (rather than
              | a lone individual performer) to control for
              | nuisance factors like modeling, distraction, and
              | mere presence of another performer. Unfortu-
              | nately, the coaction control condition also
              | allows the possibility of a direct, immediate, and
              | public comparison of scores with another per-
              | former, whereas the information-reducing
              | aspect of the group task makes such an inter-
              | personal comparison unfeasible. In fact, not
              | only is such comparison possible in the coactive
              | condition, instructions that are delivered to the
              | two coactors prior to the task suggest that such
              | comparison is certain (‘The experimenter also
              | told the participants that he would count up
              | their individual scores . . . at the end of the
              | session and tell them how many uses they had
              | produced’, p. 574, Williams & Karau, 1991).
              | Such opportunities for a direct and immediate
              | comparison could well lead to one using the
              | anticipated output of the coactor as a basis for
              | choosing one’s own level of effort—a type of
              | ‘production matching’ with an implicit per-
              | formance standard (cf. Stroebe et al., 1996).
              | In sum, the social compensation effect could
              | be due: (a) to the imperative of compensating
              | for an incapable partner in the collective con-
              | dition (the usual interpretation); and/or (b) to
              | demotivating effects of public comparison with
              | an incapable other in the coaction condition
              | (an alternative, artifactual interpretation, which
              | we will term the social-comparison explanation).
              | The latter possibility is not theoretically far-
              | fetched; if one believes that the one person with
              | whom s/he will soon be publicly compared is
              | not very capable, one may feel that less effort is
              | required to insure a favorable comparison. In
              | addition, the expectation that one’s own per-
              | formance will probably surpass that of readily
              | available comparison others could well be
              | demotivating by reducing opportunities for
              | both meaningful self-evaluation and favorable
              | external evaluation (cf. Harkins, 2001). Consist-
              | ent with such speculation, empirical demon-
              | strations of the social compensation effect have
              | not been characterized by a dramatic rise in
              | effort when social compensation is needed (i.e.
              | in the incapable partner/collective condition),

              | but as the social-comparison explanation
              | implies, rather by a dramatic drop in effort in
              | the coaction control condition (see Figure 1).2
              | One counterargument to the artifactual
              | explanation is that a similar pattern of results
              | has been found (Williams & Karau, 1991,
              | Experiment 1) when the subject received no
              | direct feedback indicating that his/her partner
              | was incapable, but instead was chronically mis-
              | trustful of others (and thus, to ‘. . . expect
              | others to loaf’). Speciﬁcally, those medium and
              | high in level of trust showed a social loaﬁng
              | effect (i.e. coactive > collective), whereas those
              | low in trust showed the opposite, social com-
              | pensation effect (i.e. collective > coactive). It
              | might be argued that absent direct feedback
              | that one’s partner was incapable, the purported
              | demotivating effect of being compared with
              | him/her should not occur. But these data are
              | inconclusive. First, mistrustfulness could breed
              | lowered expectation of the other’s likely per-
              | formance not just when the other is a teammate
              | but also when s/he is a coactor. Expectations of
              | the other’s performance were collected, but
              | analyzed in such a way that it is unclear whether
              | or not expectations were equally low for mis-
              | trustful participants in both the collective and
              | coaction conditions. Second, unlike the other
              | social compensation studies, the key moderator
              | here is a personality (rather than a situational)
              | factor, and thus, other relevant individual
              | differences could have been confounds (e.g. if
              | low trusters are also relatively more concerned
              | about a possibly invidious comparison). Thus,
              | although these data are not irrelevant to the
              | artifactual explanation, they do not rule it out.
              | The purpose of this brief paper is to report an
              | empirical examination of the artifactual social-
              | comparison explanation. We sought to (a) repli-
              | cate the usual social compensation effect (i.e.
              | with a coaction control), and then (b) include
              | another isolated-individual-performer control
              | condition in which direct and immediate social
              | comparison with an incapable coactor was not
              | possible. The various nuisance effects that
              | coaction has been designed to control (e.g. dis-
              | traction, modeling, mere presence) were con-
              | trolled in all conditions here by preventing
              | participants from seeing one another or their
meta          | 434
text          | work products during the experiment.3 Of
              | special interest are two possibilities: (1) that the
              | pattern of results is the same with an individual
              | control as with coactor controls, which would
              | contradict the artifactual explanation; and (2)
              | that the social compensation effect is eliminated
              | when one uses an individual control, ﬁndings
              | that would suggest the effect is entirely due to
              | the artifactual explanation. Of course, other
              | patterns are also possible and of interest (e.g.
              | the social compensation effect is attenuated but
              | not eliminated with the individual control, sug-
              | gesting that the artifact contributes to but does
              | not wholly account for the effect; the social com-
              | pensation effect is even stronger with individual
              | controls, suggesting that the opportunity for
              | social comparison—even with a very incapable
              | partner—is motivating and hence, that the use
              | of coactor controls actually underestimates the
              | magnitude of the social compensation effect).
              | To the degree that the artifactual social-com-
              | parison explanation is supported, the attribu-
              | tion veracity of the observed effect being due to
              | a motivation gain would be undermined. As a
              | result, we would be forced to conclude that
              | group motivation gain effects are even rarer
              | than previously thought.
              | Method
              | Participants and design
              | The participants (Ps) were 167 female under-
              | graduate students from introductory psychol-
              | ogy courses who received course credit for their
              | participation. (Note that previous studies, e.g.
              | Williams & Karau, 1991 and Hart et al., 2001,
              | report no moderation of the social compen-
              | sation effect by sex of participant.) The design
              | was a 2 (Partner capability: High vs. Low) 3
              | (Work condition: Collective vs. Coactive vs.
              | Individual) between-Ps factorial.
              | Task and procedure
              | The task was the same idea generation exercise
              | that most previous social compensation
              | research has used. Ps were asked to generate as
              | many uses for a common object (viz. knife) as
              | they could in a 12-minute period. Instructions
              | (taken nearly verbatim from Williams et al.,
              | 1991) stressed quantity, not quality or creativity
              | of uses. In order to maximize the importance or
              | meaningfulness of the task, participants were
              | told that research suggested that performance
              | on the use-generating task is highly correlated
              | with intelligence and achievement; it has been
              | shown (Williams & Karau, 1991, Experiment 3)
              | that social compensation requires a task for
              | which good performance is important (other-
              | wise, why bother to compensate for an
              | incapable partner?). As they performed, Ps sat
              | opposite each other at computer tables with a
              | sight-blocking partition between them. In the
              | Coaction and Individual conditions, there was a
              | box on each table into which the uses were
              | placed (one per slip of paper). In the Collective
              | condition, there was a single, common box
              | inside the double-walled partition which caught
              | the slips of paper that both dyad members
              | pushed through slits in the partition walls.
              | These slits were so located that neither dyad
              | member could see when a slip was being
              | pushed through by her teammate or how many
              | slips there were in the box. To further eliminate
              | potential distraction, modeling, or mere
              | presence effects, Ps wore headphones playing
              | music as they performed the task.
              | Most Ps were scheduled in pairs and when
              | both showed up, either a Collective or Coactive
              | condition—randomly determined—was run.
              | When only one P signed or showed up, a female
              | confederate took on the partner role. Thus, all
              | sessions began with two partners present—
              | either two actual Ps or one P plus a confeder-
              | ate. As will become clear below, Ps in the
              | Individual condition always had the confeder-
              | ate as a partner.
              | The procedure used in this experiment was a
              | variation on the procedures used by Karau &
              | Williams (Experiment 2, 1997) and Hart et al.
              | (2001). Upon arrival, both the participants (or
              | the actual P and the confederate, if applicable)
              | were led to one of two computer tables in the
              | laboratory. Each of the computer tables was
              | equipped with a computer, a stack of exactly
              | ﬁfty blank slips of paper, a pen, and a pair of
              | headphones.
              | After signing a consent form, Ps received a
              | description of the uses-generation task. In the
              | Todd et al. social compensation
              | Coaction and Individual conditions, the exper-
              | imenter explained that she was interested in
              | their individual performances, not their collec-
              | tive performance. In the Collective condition,
              | the Ps were told that they comprised a two-
              | person group and that the experimenter was
              | only interested in the total number of uses
              | generated collectively by the group and not in
              | individual performances. The experimenter
              | also demonstrated how the single collection
              | box worked and, in doing so, stressed the
              | anonymity of individual contributions (e.g.
              | noted that the dyad members would use pens
              | with the same color ink).
              | Participants were then told that one purpose
              | of the experiment was to examine the effects of
              | standardized communication strategies on indi-
              | vidual and group task performance. Purport-
              | edly employees in large corporations had been
              | using banks of prewritten messages in order to
              | simplify email communication, and we were
              | interested in investigating the effect of this
              | form of standardized communication on
              | employee performance and satisfaction. Ps
              | were to choose one message from each of
              | three banks of standardized messages (three
              | messages total) that would be sent to their
              | coworker via computer. The first bank
              | expressed Ps’ interest in the task (seven alterna-
              | tive messages whose content communicated
              | differing levels of task interest, ranging from
              | very high to very low). The second bank
              | expressed Ps’ expected level of effort on the
              | coming task. The third bank expressed Ps’ self-
              | perceived ability at the coming task. After
              | choosing one message from each bank, Ps
              | clicked a button to send their message set to
              | their partner (in fact, these messages were
              | never sent). Ps then shortly after received three
              | messages, allegedly from their partner. In all
              | conditions, the partner’s first message
              | expressed a high interest in the task. The
              | remaining two messages manipulated the
              | partner’s task capability. In the High capability
              | condition, the messages were ‘My effort on this
              | task will be extremely high’ and ‘My ability on
              | this task is extremely high’. In the Low capabil-
              | ity condition, the messages were ‘My effort on
              | this task will be extremely low’ and ‘My ability
meta          | 435
text          | Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 9(3)
              | on this task is extremely low’.4 While the
              | message-exchanging portion of the experiment
              | was taking place, the experimenter left the
              | room; moreover, after reading the messages
              | received, Ps clicked a button that allegedly per-
              | manently erased the messages. This was done to
              | ensure that Ps believed that the experimenter
              | would not be able to ascertain either a P’s pro-
              | fessed level of motivation or their ability to
              | perform the task.5
              | After a short interval which gave Ps the
              | opportunity to read the messages sent by their
              | partner, the experimenter re-entered the lab.
              | In the Individual condition only, the experi-
              | menter asked the confederate whether she was,
              | as she had indicated on her consent form,
              | under 18 years of age. The confederate said she
              | was. The experimenter explained that she
              | could not participate without parental consent
              | and that she would have to obtain such consent
              | before she could be rescheduled. For this
              | reason, she was excused from the experiment
              | and left the lab. Note that this procedure
              | insured that the true P in the Individual con-
              | dition always had the knowledge that another
              | ostensibly random participant was either very
              | high or very low in task capability (as in the
              | other two work conditions), but it removed the
              | opportunity for a direct, immediate, and public
              | performance comparison with that participant
              | at the conclusion of the task. (Of course, in
              | theory, the experimenter could later compare
              | an Individual P’s performance with that of
              | other participants, but there was no possibility
              | in this condition of immanent comparison
              | which we assume to be the P’s concern in our
              | social-comparison alternative to the usual social
              | compensation explanation.)
              | At this point the participant(s) were directed
              | to put on their headphones and to follow the
              | rest of the instructions contained on the tape.
              | The experimenter again left the room. The
              | instructions on the tape, which described the
              | speciﬁc object (i.e. a knife) for which they were
              | to generate as many uses as they could, were
              | followed by 12 minutes of music, during which
              | the participants worked at the task—thinking of
              | uses for the target object, writing their answer
              | on slips of paper, folding the slips and placing
meta          | 436
text          | them in their collection box(es). The experi-
              | menter monitored the time using a stopwatch.
              | At the end of the work period, Ps were given a
              | post-experimental questionnaire that con-
              | tained manipulation checks and checks of
              | suspicion. Finally, Ps were debriefed, thanked,
              | and dismissed.
              | Results
              | Manipulation checks
              | P’s were asked to assess on 7-point rating scales
              | how much effort the partner was willing to exert
              | at the task and how much ability she had. As one
              | would expect, the partner in the Low capability
              | conditions was seen both as willing to exert less
              | effort (M = 3.92) and having less ability (M =
              | 4.22) than the partner in the High capability
              | condition (effort M = 6.31, t(152) = 8.36, p <
              | .001, d = 1.36; ability M = 5.65, t(152) = 5.79, p <
              | .001, d = .94); reduced degrees of freedom
              | reﬂect missing data due to failures to complete
              | the questionnaire). Hence, the manipulation of
              | partner capability was successful.
              | Analyses of performance
              | Replication of the social compensation effect?
              | The ﬁrst question we examined was whether we
              | replicated the basic social compensation effect
              | under the typical conditions (viz. with coactors
              | as controls). In all conditions, the ideas gener-
              | ated were counted by subtracting the number
              | of unused slips from 50 (all Ps were given 50
              | slips of paper before beginning the idea-
              | generation task). The key contrast tests an
              | interaction effect—is the usual social loaﬁng
              | effect observed when one believes that one has
              | a very capable partner (i.e. Collective <
              | Coactive) reversed when one believes that one
              | has a very incapable partner (i.e. Coactive <
              | Collective)? A test of this contrast was statisti-
              | cally signiﬁcant (F(1,161) = 4.02, p < .05, d =
              | .32), and as one can see in Figure 2 (white and
              | black bars), the same pattern is observed as in
              | the usual social compensation study (see Figure
              | 1). In the present study, the social loaﬁng effect
              | (High capability partner) was significant
              | (t(161) = 1.96, p = .05, d = .31), whereas the

              | could be that performance would also be lower
              | in the Individual/High capability condition
              | than the Coaction/High capability condition.
              | But as one can see in Figure 2, this was not the
              | case; there was no difference between these two
              | control conditions (t(161) = .07, ns). It is at
              | least possible, though, that ceiling effects may
              | have prevented such an effect from emerging
              | here.
              | Discussion
              | The use of coaction controls in prior social com-
              | pensation research has left open the possibility
              | that the effect might artifactually have resulted
              | from a confound between work condition
              | (Coaction vs. Collective) and the opportunity to
              | make performance comparisons. If making
              | such a comparison with a very incapable other
              | were demotivating, then it could have been the
              | case that the social compensation effect had
              | little or nothing to do with the need to compen-
              | sate for an incapable partner, but stemmed
              | instead from such a social comparison process.
              | In the present study, we directly tested this
              | alternative, artifactual explanation for the social
              | compensation effect. Our data strongly contra-
              | dict it. Removing the opportunity for immediate
              | public comparison with an incapable other did
              | not, as this explanation would predict, increase
              | effort, but actually tended (nonsigniﬁcantly) to
              | decrease effort. It appears that the opportunity
              | for comparison is (if anything) motivating, even
              | when the person with whom one will compare is
              | very likely to perform poorly. Thus, far from
              | being the source of an artifactual explanation,
              | the use of the coaction control in prior social
              | compensation has tended to work against
              | demonstrating the effect, and to underestimat-
              | ing its strength.
              | These findings have several useful impli-
              | cations. First, and most obviously, they bolster
              | the validity of the original interpretation of the
              | best documented of the few extant group moti-
              | vation gain effects, the social compensation
              | effect. That interpretation suggested that the
              | observed motivation gain was attributable to a
              | particular pattern of outcome interpendence—
              | where one’s prospects of obtaining a highly
meta          | 438
text          | valued outcome (e.g. a group success)
              | depended upon compensating for the per-
              | ceived incapacities of other group members by
              | working extra hard. However, quite apart from
              | the alternative social-comparison explanation
              | examined here, there were theoretical and
              | empirical reasons to doubt that interpretation.
              | For example, when the rewards of group
              | success are shared equally by all group
              | members (as they were here and in prior social
              | compensation research), socially compensating
              | for others can result in doing more than an
              | equal or fair share of the group’s work. Such an
              | inequitable arrangement has been shown to
              | lead to motivation losses under some con-
              | ditions—at times, group members will reduce
              | their own efforts (and consequently, the
              | chances of group success) rather than do more
              | than what they see as a fair share of the group’s
              | work. Williams and Karau (1991) suggest that
              | this aversion to ‘playing the sucker’ can be
              | overcome if one places a sufﬁciently high value
              | on group success; they even demonstrate (in
              | their Experiment 3) that the social compen-
              | sation effect is eliminated if the group’s task is
              | seen as unimportant to its members. By discon-
              | ﬁrming a plausible alternative to the social com-
              | pensation explanation, our results lend
              | credibility to their suggestion. Apparently,
              | group members who are exerting supernormal
              | levels of effort will put up with doing an
              | inequitable share of the group’s work if group
              | success is sufﬁciently valued.
              | Our study also touches on a fundamental
              | issue in the study of group motivation—what is
              | the proper non-group baseline against which to
              | detect group motivation gains or losses? Some
              | (e.g. Karau & Williams, 1993; Williams & Karau,
              | 1991) have argued that coactors provide the
              | most appropriate baseline. Others (e.g. Kerr,
              | 1983; Markus, 2001) have argued that isolated
              | individuals represent better baselines. As the
              | present paper suggests, this controversy is par-
              | tially a matter of how best to avoid uninterest-
              | ing confounds (e.g. to control for ‘mere
              | presence’ effects when probing for group moti-
              | vation gains or losses). But it is also a matter of
              | a fundamental conceptual issue—viz. ‘what is
              | and is not a group’? There is no universally
              | agreed upon answer to this question; however,
              | many if not most scholars include shared goals
              | and some degree of mutual interdependence as
              | necessary properties of a group, especially a
              | performance group (cf. Forsyth, 1999). Our
              | own preference for isolated individuals as the
              | best non-group baseline stems from the fact
              | that many typical elements of the coaction
              | setting (such as the mere presence of others,
              | the possibility of distraction, the possibility of
              | attentional conﬂict, the opportunity to observe
              | others perform, the opportunity to compare
              | levels of performance), while common
              | elements of performance groups, are not
              | defining necessary conditions. Thus, motiva-
              | tional gains or losses which ultimately stem
              | from such elements could well be viewed as not
              | being essentially group phenomena, but
              | instead being phenomena that can arise in
              | certain group settings but not others. On the
              | other hand, one could argue (as Latané et al.,
              | 1979, did implicitly in their seminal social
              | loafing paper) that if certain elements (e.g.
              | individual member contributions being
              | unidentifiable from a group product) are
              | routine features of many performance groups,
              | then the motivational effects of those elements
              | could fairly be classiﬁed as group effects (even
              | if those same elements are not necessary for all
              | or even most performance groups).
              | Clearly, this is partially a semantic issue, but it
              | is more than that. The answer to many import-
              | ant questions—e.g. is a particular effect a
              | genuine group motivation loss or gain? where
              | should one look for such effects? when it comes
              | to application, are groups or teams superior or
              | inferior to individuals as performers?—ulti-
              | mately depends on just what processes we
              | classify as group processes. And whenever indi-
              | vidual performance differs in individual and
              | coactive performance settings, the answers we
              | come up with depend on just which baseline we
              | choose. Consider, for example, the following:
              | • Another recently documented (purported)
              | group motivation gain is the Köhler motiva-
              | tion gain effect (Hertel et al., 2000). Here, it
              | is the least capable group member who must
              | work extra hard because the task demands
              | Todd et al. social compensation
              | are conjunctive (Steiner, 1972)—i.e. the
              | group’s performance depends on the least
              | capable member’s performance. The
              | original (Köhler, 1926) and subsequent
              | (Hertel et al., 2000; Messé, Hertel, Kerr,
              | Lount, & Park, 2002; Stroebe et al., 1996)
              | empirical demonstrations of the effect have
              | all used isolated individual performers as
              | their non-group baselines. But some of the
              | proposed explanations of this effect do not
              | require what we have advanced as conditions
              | necessary for groups. For example, Stroebe
              | et al.’s (1996) goal setting explanation only
              | requires the availability of a more capable
              | performer, not the existence of a more
              | capable group member working toward a
              | common goal with some interdependence
              | (e.g. a conjunctive group task). If such
              | explanations are valid, then we might expect
              | the Köhler effect to occur in a number of
              | coaction settings. Although an initial attempt
              | to test this possibility offered little support to
              | the goal setting explanation (see Hertel
              | et al., 2000, Experiment 2), subsequent tests
              | suggest that it does provide a partial expla-
              | nation of the effect (Kerr, Seok, Poulsen,
              | Harris, & Messé, 2006). The important point
              | is that we could have come to different con-
              | clusions about whether the Köhler effect was
              | a genuine group motivation gain, how large
              | it was, and why it occurred had we chosen
              | isolated individuals or coactors as our
              | baseline of non-group performance.
              | • Members of mixed-sex dyads have been
              | shown to work harder than either members
              | of same-sex dyads or isolated individual
              | controls, an effect that has been interpreted
              | as a group motivation gain (Kerr & Sullaway,
              | 1983; Kerr & MacCoun, 1984). But if this
              | effect is the result of concerns about violat-
              | ing traditional sex role expectations, then it
              | may not require collaborative group
              | action—mixed-sex sets of coactors could
              | show a similar effect.
              | • Other work has shown that members of
              | groups who can engage in intra- (Stroebe
              | et al., 1996) or intergroup (Erev et al., 1993;
              | Worchel, Rothgerber, Day, Hart, & Bute-
              | meyer, 1998) competition work harder than

              | •
              | individual controls. But certain explanations
              | of this effect suggest that coaction settings
              | which offer similar opportunities for compe-
              | tition might produce quite similar effects.
              | Markus (2001) has shown that some social
              | loaﬁng effects might be attributable to the
              | differential effects of individual vs. coaction
              | work conditions on intrinsic task motivation.
              | We suspect that such issues cannot and
              | should not be resolved by fiat—by simply
              | declaring one particular non-group baseline as
              | the ‘gold standard’ for group motivation
              | effects. Rather, we would like to suggest that the
              | two most popular non-group baselines—
              | isolated individuals and coacting individuals—
              | both provide informative baselines for
              | analyzing psychological processes of relevance
              | to how hard people work in groups. In the
              | present study we were able to narrow the range
              | of plausible explanations for the social compen-
              | sation effect by including both baselines.
              | Future work on group motivation could and
              | should be likewise enriched by including
              | multiple baselines. And even when this is not
              | possible, scholars would be well advised to
              | consider the theoretical implications of exam-
              | ining alternatives to the baselines they do
              | employ.
              | Notes
              | 1. By effort-sensitive, we mean a task for which
              | performance is entirely or almost entirely a
              | function of effort (rather than other factors, like
              | ability, insight, luck, etc.) and for which there is a
              | monotonic relationship between performance
              | and effort.
              | 2. It must be conceded that the pattern in these
              | data—a relatively low level of performance of the
              | coactor-low capability partner, compared to
              | coactor-high capability partner—could result
              | from processes other than the social comparison
              | explanation proposed here. For example, it is
              | conceivable that one tends to match a coworker’s
              | expected level of performance, regardless of
              | whether performance levels will subsequently be
              | compared. This would result in generally lower
              | performance in the low partner capability
              | conditions (which could then be further
meta          | 440
text          | moderated by a social compensation effect,
              | resulting in a relatively higher level of
              | performance in the collective-incapable partner
              | condition). Thus, we agree with Williams and
              | Karau’s suggestion that the result of primary
              | interest is a particular interaction effect, viz. the
              | reversal—when one has an incapable partner—of
              | the usual social loaﬁng effect (observed here
              | when one has a capable partner, or as in the
              | typical social loaﬁng study, when one knows
              | nothing about others’ capabilities).
              | 3. It should also be noted that the use of a coaction
              | control condition is not always simply a matter of
              | controlling nuisance variables. A number of tests
              | of substantive theories of social facilitation and
              | social loaﬁng have suggested that working alone
              | is psychologically different than working
              | alongside others (e.g. Cottrell, 1972; Harkins,
              | 1987, 2001; Sanna, 1992).
              | 4. Note that we jointly varied ability and motivation
              | feedback to create the High and Low
              | partner-capability conditions. In an experiment
              | which orthogonally manipulated ability and
              | motivation feedback, Hart et al., (2001) found
              | that the standard social compensation effect only
              | occurred when both were low. This suggests that
              | in earlier studies (e.g. Williams & Karau, 1991)
              | where only one of these two bases for capability
              | had been manipulated, Ps presumed that the
              | other varied in kind (e.g. a poorly motivated
              | partner was also likely to have low ability).
              | 5. Another possible boundary condition on social
              | compensation is that those who evaluate group
              | task performance (e.g. a supervisor; the
              | experimenter) should not know that there is an
              | incapable member in the group. Otherwise, such
              | an evaluator might attribute a poor group
              | performance not to the team as a whole
              | (including the more capable member) but just to
              | the incapable member’s probable poor
              | performance. The more capable member should
              | not be as likely to try to compensate under such
              | conditions.
              | 6. We have also argued (see Note 2) that neither the
              | signiﬁcance of the simple partner-capability main
              | effects nor or their relative (absolute) magnitudes
              | are of special interest here. However, for the
              | interested reader, the simple partner-capability
              | main effect under coactive conditions was not
              | signiﬁcant (t(161) = .73, ns), while the
              | corresponding simple main effect under
              | collective conditions was (t(161) = –2.01, p < .05,
              | d = .32).
