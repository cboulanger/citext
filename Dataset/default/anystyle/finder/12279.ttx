              | Abstract
              | Aims To ascertain physicians’ and parents’ attitudes to-
              | wards varicella vaccination acceptance and to compare
              | them between Germany (G), where routine varicella
              | vaccination is recommended in children, and France (F),
              | where it is not.
              | Methods Study design: cross-sectional pharmacoepidemio-
              | logical study conducted in pediatric practice. Data included
              | descriptions of the vaccinated children by pediatricians and
              | descriptions of the parents’ attitudes using a self-administered
              | questionnaire. The next five successive children, under
              | 15 years old, vaccinated against varicella were included in
              | the study.
              | Results Six hundred ninety-five pediatricians (F: 186; G:
              | 509) and 2,593 parents (F: 664; G: 1,929) were included in
              | the study. Initially, 7.1% of the German parents and 15.3%
              | of the French parents were reluctant to have their children
              | inoculated with the varicella vaccine (p < 0.0001). The
              | main reason for their reluctance was the ‘fear of
              | complications due to the vaccination’ in both countries
              | (G: 60.0% vs 55.5%; p: ns). Fewer German parents
              | thought that the varicella vaccine was too recent (5.9%

              | vs 45.5%; p < 0.0001), and they were also less reluctant
              | due to the cost of the vaccination (G: 11.9% vs F:22.8%;
              | p< 0.02). In both countries, the most convincing arguments
              | for parents who were initially reluctant were ‘information on
              | the potential seriousness of the disease,’ which was reported
              | by three-quarters of the parents (G: 70.0% vs F: 74.3%;
              | p: ns), and ‘availability of an effective, well-tolerated
              | vaccine’ (G: 59.4% vs F: 64.0%; p: ns).
              | Conclusion Even in the absence of an official recommen-
              | dation, French parents will accept varicella vaccine to the
              | same extent as German parents where it is advisable if they
              | receive appropriate information about the potential severity
              | of the disease and the efficacy and safety of the vaccine.

              | Introduction
              | Many studies have shown that vaccines can protect children
              | and adults from bacterial and viral infections. Vaccination
              | has led to important reductions in the incidences of several
              | diseases and even eradication in same instances, for
              | example, small pox. Despite their proven effectiveness,
              | many children do not receive vaccines because of their
              | parents’ philosophy or religious beliefs, their concerns
              | about costs, or doubts about the usefulness, safety, or
              | efficacy of vaccines (Poland and Jacobson 2001; Taylor et
              | al. 2002; Alfredsson et al. 2004; Fredrickson et al. 2004;
              | Freed et al. 2004). Reluctance to use vaccines has been
              | fueled by reports of alleged adverse events from vaccines
              | spread by anti-vaccination web sites, as well as by recent
              | vaccine recalls and modifications (Freed et al. 1996; Wolfe
              | et al. 2002; Flanagan-Klygis et al. 2005). The situation is

meta          | 72
text          | worse when the vaccine is not universally recommended,
              | and even when a vaccine is recommended, not all
              | physicians immediately adopt it in routine use.
              | Varicella vaccine is one example for which these issues
              | have slowed uptake. In the US, varicella vaccination has
              | been recommended since 1996, but it took nearly 5 years to
              | reach satisfactory coverage of more than 80% of children
              | (Sengupta et al. 2007). This vaccination has led to a
              | reduction in the incidence of varicella of about 75% (CDC
              | 2003). Doctors must be ready to answer parents’ questions
              | and address misconceptions since parental beliefs may be a
              | major factor influencing whether a child receives the
              | varicella vaccine (Taylor and Newman 2000).
              | The varicella vaccine is being increasingly used through-
              | out Europe, although with different administrative and
              | regulatory modalities. For example, in France, the varicella
              | vaccine has been registered since December 2003, but there
              | are no national recommendations for its routine use in
              | children. Recommendations exist for health-care and child-
              | care workers, those who have close contacts with immu-
              | nocompromised people, and children requiring a solid
              | organ transplant, and for people, at least 18 years old,
              | within 3 days of contact with an infected person. In
              | addition, this vaccine is not reimbursed by the health-care
              | insurance system. In contrast, in Germany, routine admin-
              | istration to healthy children has been officially recommen-
              | ded since July 2004, and it is reimbursed in most
              | administrative areas (Rasch and Hellenbrand 2004). Thus,
              | Germany and France provide an interesting comparison for
              | studying the effect of recommendations and funding on the
              | attitudes of parents concerning varicella vaccination. For
              | this we surveyed parents of children that were vaccinated
              | against varicella by private pediatricians or general practi-
              | tioners in Germany and France between March 2005 and
              | March 2006.
              | Materials and methods
              | The purpose of this cross-sectional study conducted
              | between March 2005 and March 2006 was to ascertain
              | physicians’ and parents’ attitudes towards varicella vacci-
              | nation acceptance and to compare them between Germany
              | (G), where routine varicella vaccination is recommended in
              | children, and France (F), where it is not. Two samples of
              | 600 pediatricians (or GPs with essentially child-oriented
              | practices) selected at random in France and Germany were
              | involved. They were asked to include the next five
              | successive children they vaccinated against varicella during
              | the next month. These recruitment conditions led in each
              | country to a sample of 3,000 cases providing a confidence
              | interval of under 2% in case of an observed percentage
              | under 5%. This choice was made due to the fact that we
              | J Public Health (2009) 17:71–76
              | expected a low value for some questions, in particular for
              | the spontaneous request for varicella vaccination, especially
              | in France, where it is not reimbursed. These children had to
              | be under 15 years of age and had to have no contra-
              | indications to the vaccine. Information on the main
              | demographic and clinical characteristics of the vaccinated
              | children as well as why the parents accepted the vaccination
              | was recorded by the physician on the physician’s question-
              | naire. Information on the parents’ attitudes concerning the
              | varicella vaccination was recorded on a self-administered
              | questionnaire that the pediatrician gave them after having
              | explained how to fill it in. This questionnaire was returned
              | directly to the data analysis center in a prepaid envelope to
              | protect anonymity. A common number included in the two
              | documents allowed matching the pediatrician form with the
              | self-administered questionnaire for the purposes of the
              | statistical analysis.
              | Results are expressed as means with their standard
              | deviations for quantitative variables and by numbers and
              | frequency distributions for qualitative variables. Chi-square
              | analysis and analysis of variance were respectively per-
              | formed to compare qualitative and quantitative values
              | between France and Germany. A P-value of less than 0.05
              | was considered to indicate statistical significance.
              | Results
              | Population and context of the vaccination
              | Between March 2005 and March 2006, 509 German
              | pediatricians participated in the study and only 186 French
              | pediatricians because of some recruitment difficulties in
              | relation to the absence of varicella vaccination recommen-
              | dations in France. This point will be discussed. The
              | questionnaire was given to the parents of 3,033 vaccinated
              | children. A total of 2,593 questionnaires was returned
              | (85.6% response rate; 1,929 from Germany and 664 from
              | France). The mean age, percentage of girls, family size, and
              | rank of the vaccinated children were similar for the two
              | countries (Table 1). The only variable that was significantly
              | different was the parent’s education level: 36.1% of parents
              | in Germany vs. 55.3% of parents in France were university
              | or advanced technical college graduates (P< 0.0001).
              | The rate of spontaneously requested varicella vaccina-
              | tion was significantly higher for German parents than for
              | French parents (20.9% vs 12.6%; P< 0.0001). As shown in
              | Fig. 1, except for ‘avoid illness’ and ‘child living in close
              | contact with other children,’ which are the two main
              | reasons for spontaneous requests for vaccination, nearly
              | all the other reasons given by parents were significantly
              | different between the two countries: ‘Prevent complica-
              | tions’ was mentioned more often in Germany than in

              | media’ (42.3% vs 19.2%; P < 0.0001). The reasons for a
              | spontaneous request for varicella vaccination were less
              | often in Germany than in France ‘avoid social and
              | professional impact of child’s illness’ (29.1% vs 47.7%;
              | P < 0.0001), ‘child’s relative currently has varicella’ (5.6%
              | and 21.5%; P < 0.0001), and ‘avoid scarring’ (20.5% vs
              | 29.6%; p < 0.05).
              | Parents’ opinions concerning varicella vaccination
              | The analysis of the parents’ questionnaire (Fig. 2) reveals
              | that 7.1% of the German and 15.3% of the French parents
              | were initially reluctant to allow their children to receive the
              | varicella vaccine (P < 0.0001). The two main reasons for
              | their reluctance were similar in the two countries, and both
              | concerned the vaccination itself: ‘Complications following
              | vaccination’ (G: 60.0% vs F: 55.5%; p: ns) and ‘too many
              | vaccinations’ (G: 43.0% vs F: 40.6%; p: ns). The varicella

              | than German parents (G: 5.9% vs F: 45.5%; p < 0.0001).
              | Also, more French parents were reluctant due to the cost of
              | the vaccination (G: 11.9% vs F: 22.8%; p < 0.02) or because
              | they considered their child too young (G: 5.9% vs F:
              | 13.9%; p < 0.05).
              | In both countries, the most convincing arguments for
              | parents who were initially reluctant or who did not know
              | that a varicella vaccine existed were ‘information on the
              | potential seriousness of the disease,’ which was reported by
              | three-quarters of the parents, and ‘availability of an
              | effective, well-tolerated vaccine,’ which was mentioned
              | by 59.4% and 64.0% of the parents in Germany and France,
              | respectively (p: ns) (Fig. 3). The other reasons, in
              | decreasing order of importance, were information that
              | ‘varicella is frequent and contagious’ and ‘prevention of
              | varicella scars’ and ‘impact on the family of the disease.’
              | Finally, the fact that vaccination is free of charge in
              | Germany was indicated as an advantage by 23.4% of the
              | German parents.

              | Discussion
              | In the current study, we investigated parents’ attitudes to
              | accepting varicella vaccination between France and Germany
              | and the best way to convince them to have their children
              | vaccinated.
              | The comparison with Germany was chosen because it
              | was the first country in Europe that added varicella
              | vaccination to the national routine vaccination schedule
              | for all children; it was the first country in the European
              | Union to do this. The Ständige Impfkommission (Standing
              | Committee on Vaccination, STIKO) at the Robert Koch
              | Institute in Germany announced the change in their
              | published update to the national vaccine schedule (Robert
              | Koch-Institut 2004a, b). According to these official
              | recommendations, varicella vaccination is scheduled for
              | infants aged between 11 and 14 months (given preferably
              | at the same time as the MMR vaccine). Catch-up
              | vaccination for children and adults is recommended, in
              | particular for persons aged 9–17 years who have not had
              | varicella infection. In France, no such recommendation
              | exists, and the comparison with Germany was done in
              | order to evaluate the impact of this recommendation and,
              | moreover, to analyze if the existence a such recommen-
              | dations was a sine qua non condition to the spreading of
              | the varicella vaccine.
              | Potential biases should be considered before generalizing
              | the results to all parents of young children.
              | Fig. 3 Most convincing
              | arguments in favor of varicella
              | vaccination. Comparison
              | between Germany and France
              | J Public Health (2009) 17:71–76
              | The most important possible bias is that the physicians
              | who agreed to participate in the study may be those who are
              | most in favor of varicella vaccination and therefore the
              | most inclined to convince the parents. This bias is
              | unavoidable, but its influence would be the same in both
              | countries. This potential bias may also have had some
              | impact on the parents’ opinion, but the effect would have
              | been minimal because the parents completed a strictly
              | anonymous self-administered questionnaire that they sent
              | directly to the data analysis center.
              | One other bias could be linked to the fact that the rate of
              | pediatricians participating to the study in France was much
              | lower than in Germany. The lack of a recommendation in favor
              | of varicella vaccination in France (and consequently the
              | absence of reimbursement) explains why many practitioners
              | are still reluctant to propose it to parents and thus the difficulties
              | we met recruiting regular varicella vaccine prescribers. These
              | recruitment difficulties have an unavoidable effect on the
              | precision of the results, providing an average confidence
              | interval of 2% for the German data and of 4% for the French
              | data rather than the initially expected <2%. However,
              | taking into account that the lowest percentage described for
              | the French sample is 12.6% of spontaneously requested
              | varicella vaccination, this precision of 4% still appears
              | satisfactory.
              | Another limit of our study is also due to the fact that we
              | only considered vaccinated children, while it could have
              | been interesting to describe the attitude and intentions from
              | the parents who refused the vaccination of their child. This
              | choice to focus our study on vaccination acceptance and
              | eventual previous reluctance and not on refusal was
              | dictated by the lack of recommendation for varicella
              | vaccination in France. Also, a written inquiry about the
              | patient’s refusal could have been interpreted by the health
              | authority as an unacceptable attempt to strongly influence
              | them, and the rate of spontaneous answer would have been
              | very low.
              | Despite potential biases and limits, our results revealed
              | that the presence of a recommendation for the vaccination
              | in Germany and its absence in France have a major impact
              | on the parents’ knowledge about the disease and its
              | complications as well as on health-care promotion of the
              | vaccine.
              | A first remark concerns the educational level of the
              | parents of the vaccinated children, which was higher in
              | France than in Germany. This reflects that in France, due to
              | the lack of official recommendation and of reimbursement,
              | the educational level and the level of income of parents has
              | a strong influence on the acceptance of varicella.
              | Due to the availability of an official recommendation,
              | more German parents were aware of the varicella vaccine
              | and spontaneously requested vaccination. In addition, their
              | reasons for requesting vaccination were different. German
meta          | 75
text          | parents identified the main purpose of the vaccine as
              | preventing complications and were convinced by information
              | from the media, whereas the French parents’ motivations were
              | linked to the social and professional consequences of the
              | disease, the prevention of infection of others, or the fear of
              | scars. These findings suggest that even the French parents who
              | spontaneously requested the vaccine were not aware of the
              | seriousness of the complications of varicella. In Germany, the
              | parents’ attitudes are similar to those described for parents in
              | the US (Taylor and Newman 2000). In particular, when a
              | recommendation exists, parents are more convinced about the
              | advantages of the vaccine to prevent serious complications
              | than its ability to reduce time lost from work.
              | The percentage of parents reluctant to accept varicella
              | vaccination in the current study does not reflect the
              | percentage in the global population; it reflects the initial
              | rate of reluctance of parents who finally agreed to have
              | their children vaccinated. Thus, the percentages reported
              | here cannot be used as the basis for making conclusions
              | about the reluctance for vaccination in the overall popula-
              | tion. The parents’ reluctance is mostly due to the fact that
              | they consider varicella to be a harmless disease and, above
              | all, fear of complications from the vaccine. The percentages
              | of parents who were reluctant due to fear of complications
              | of the vaccine (55.5% in France and 60.0% in Germany)
              | are similar to that reported in the US (69%) (Salmon et al.
              | 2005). The high proportion of French parents who said they
              | were reluctant because the varicella vaccine is too recent
              | (45.5%) is surprising, but is probably due to the fact that
              | since varicella vaccine is not officially recommended in
              | France, little information on varicella vaccination is
              | targeted to the general population. This is illustrated by
              | the fact that nearly half the French parents in our study
              | were unaware that a varicella vaccine has been available for
              | more than 10 years in the US, compared with 5.9% in
              | Germany.
              | Differences in reluctance to have children vaccinated due
              | to cost were not as big as expected. However, this finding
              | may be biased by the socioeconomic profile of the French
              | participants; on average, they have a higher educational
              | level and therefore a higher income than their German
              | counterparts. We cannot, therefore, conclude that French
              | parents are probably more willing to pay than German
              | parents. This finding could suggest that, in the absence of
              | reimbursement, the use of the vaccine will be dependent on
              | the parents’ incomes.
              | Our results show that in both countries the most
              | convincing argument in favor of the varicella vaccine is
              | the information given by the practitioner regarding the
              | seriousness of the disease and the availability of a well-
              | tolerated vaccine. The results from a study in the US, where
              | the varicella vaccine has been recommended for more than
              | 10 years, were similar; the most frequent factor influencing
meta          | 76
text          | parents’ decision was their doctor’s advice (Freeman and
              | Freed 1999).
              | In summary, our results show that both German and
              | French parents readily accepted varicella vaccination when
              | the practitioner recommended it and/or when they were
              | appropriately informed about the potential severity of
              | varicella disease and the safety of the vaccine, irrespective
              | of an official recommendation and reimbursement for the
              | vaccine. However, the absence of reimbursement may
              | affect some parents’ decision, due to the cost, and therefore,
              | this may lead to social inequality.
