              | Abstract
              | "Groupwork" is a particular form of work organisation typical for German
              | factories that has been strongly influenced by union views. Management and
              | trade unions present it as a radical innovation that calls into question the
              | principles of the former Taylorist organisation on the one hand, and the
              | meaning of production workers' work on the other hand. The workers I
              | interviewed at Volkswagen in Hannover actually develop a different analysis of
              | the new work organisation and of its outcome. Their original understanding
              | invalidates the appellation of "groupwork" itself. They strictly separate the
              | group: singular form of first-line supervision based on a new normative
              | framework, and the work: the meaning of which has remained unchanged
              | despite the implementation of the new organisation.
              | ZUSAMMENFASSUNG
              | Gruppenarbeit ist eine für die deutsche Automobilindustrie typische Form der
              | Arbeitsorganisation, die maßgeblich von Gewerkschaftsideen beeinflusst
              | wurde. Aus Sicht der Geschäftsleitungen und Gewerkschaften stellt
              | Gruppenarbeit insofern eine radikale Innovation dar, als dass sowohl die
              | Grundsätze der tayloristischen Arbeitsorganisation in Frage gestellt werden
              | sowie die Bedeutung der Arbeit, die von den Arbeitern geleistet wird. Allerdings
              | stellte sich bei Interviews mit Volkswagen in Hannover heraus, dass die Arbeiter
              | eine völlig andere Auffassung von Arbeitsorganisation und ihren Auswirkungen
              | haben. Die spezifische Vorstellung der Arbeiter widerspricht sogar dem
              | eigentlichen Begriff der "Gruppenarbeit". Sie nehmen eine strikte Trennung vor
              | zwischen der Gruppe einerseits (der singulären unteren Managementebene,
              | auf der Basis einer neuen normativen Anordnung) und der Arbeit andererseits
              | (deren Bedeutung trotz Verwirklichung der neuen Arbeitsorganisation
              | unverändert bleibt).

text          | INTRODUCTION
              | Being interested in workers and their work in Germany nowadays, it is actually
              | almost impossible to visit factories, and have discussions with managers or
              | union representatives without mentioning "groupwork" (Gruppenarbeit).
              | "Groupwork", as it is implemented in Germany neither fits Japanese teamwork
              | [Womack et al., 1990] nor a group of workers assembling an entire vehicle as in
              | Volvo's plant in Uddevalla [Sandberg, 1995], it is a particular form of work
              | organisation, typical for German factories, that calls into question the principles
              | of the former Taylorist organisation [Durand et al., 1999].
              | According to the German industrial relations system [Thelen, 1991] the
              | implementation of "groupwork" usually takes the form of a plant agreement
              | (Betriebsvereinbarung) between management and works council, and aims at
              | enhancing firm's competitiveness as well as improving work conditions.
              | From Automation to "Groupwork"
              | In the 1970s and the 1980s, technology and automation were the core of
              | management policies regarding rationalisation and competitiveness.
              | Management was aiming at replacing workforce through machines at every
              | possible place on the shopfloor. At that time, "groupwork" was a union word
              | only. It was part of the considerations arising from the project called
              | "humanisation of work" (Humanisierung der Arbeit) initiated by the federal State
              | in 1974. "Groupwork" was far from notions such as profitability and
              | competitiveness [IG Metall, 1980; Leminisky, 1980]. It was an alternative
              | proposal for better working conditions, through re-qualification of assembly line
              | work, tasks enrichment and greater workers' autonomy. It gave rise to some
              | experiences which were rapidly abandoned, as in the motor assembly
              | department at Volkswagen in Wolfsburg [Granel, 1980].
              | In 1990, the publication of the MIT study on world-wide car industry
              | [Womack et al., op. cit.] induced a major turn in western car manufacturers
              | rationalisation's strategy. This study strongly contributed to bring to light the
              | "Japanese model" and to diffuse teamwork. The automation strategy was
              | reaching its limits. Facing the emergence of very efficient Japanese competitors
              | organised in a completely different way regarding work, production or supplier
              | relations, western car assemblers started to re-think their rationalisation policy,
              | inspired by the Japanese success.

text          | At the beginning of the 1990s, German managers turned to the works
              | councils and the IG Metall1 to negotiate plant agreements on "groupwork",
              | considering now "groupwork" as a key element to restore competitiveness. By
              | doing this, they appropriated a term they have been rejecting before, and they
              | associated "groupwork" with rationalisation and profitability. As a former
              | alternative proposal to management projects, "groupwork" became the core of
              | management initiatives regarding work organisation. One observes a reversed
              | situation. Management now seeks to mobilise workers' know-how, experience
              | and creativity to enhance firms' competitiveness. "Groupwork" marks "workers'
              | come back" in management words and strategies. It also signals the collusion
              | (and sometimes the confusion) between management and union projects.
              | Work in Groups on the Assembly Line
              | In 1996, management and works council at Volkswagen Hanover decided to
              | gradually introduce "groupwork" in all departments. The negotiations' outcome
              | conducted to implement one of the most innovative forms in the German car
              | industry2. It meets what Gerst et al. [1995] call "self organised enhanced
              | groupwork". Workers are called together in groups composed of ten to fifteen
              | persons. They are collectively responsible for a portion of the line, are in charge
              | of distributing the tasks between the different jobs. They are incited to rotate
              | among jobs on a self-determined rhythm, so that each worker is able to occupy
              | any job on the group's portion of the line. Each group elects a spokesman who
              | is not paid for his function. He acts as an internal co-ordinator and represents
              | the group outside.
              | Besides production, the group as a whole is responsible for material
              | provisions, light maintenance, workplace tidiness, repairs on the product, quality
              | control and tools, but also for planning holidays and overtime recovery. In order
              | to be able to face those new responsibilities, groups are weekly given an hour
              | devoted to group-meetings, during working time. Workers themselves settle the
              | agenda, and may invite any "expert" (planning engineer, foreman, union
              | representative) being in a position to help them on any question they decide to
              | address. The most important instruction in a factory is still "never let the line
              | stop". However, group-meetings cause the stopping of the lines in the middle of
              | the day. As the works council insisted on the importance of group-meetings,
              | management finally agreed to implement them, provided that this would not
              | entail any production losses. As a consequence, daily productivity has been

              | enhanced, so that the time devoted for group-meetings does not provoke the
              | fall of the number of produced vehicles. The introduction of group-meeting has
              | then been followed by an intensification of the work on the line.
              | "Groupwork" between Innovation and Recurrence
              | This particular form of work organisation, strongly influenced by union's views,
              | proposes compatibility between assembly line work and workers' initiative. It
              | questions the traditional academic conception of assembly line work as an
              | execution of simple and repetitive tasks demanding no intellectual activity
              | [Sainseaulieu, 1998:30], as an extremely fragmented work [Friedmann, 1964],
              | or as a manual work bound by rates and technical constraints [Verret, 1999]. By
              | calling "groupwork" the new organisational pattern and the re-distribution of
              | responsibilities it is based on, management and union propose a new
              | understanding of the category of work. According to them, the new organisation
              | would radically put an end to the former vision of production workers' labour and
              | initiate an original one, including manual work and administrative
              | responsibilities, execution and planning.
              | The introduction of "groupwork" however maintains a recurrent
              | rationalisation policy and cost reduction strategy by intensifying production work
              | and enhancing rates. The outcome of the negotiations on group-meetings
              | shows that the production volume is intangible. According to this point,
              | "groupwork" only represents an adaptation of traditional rationalisation
              | strategies.
              | Consequently, "groupwork" contains a tension between two poles. On the
              | one hand, the re-distribution of responsibilities breaks with former forms of work
              | organisation: for the first time, management is giving workers the right to decide
              | on certain points, and is socialising the decision-making process. On the other
              | hand, the impossible negotiation on production volume and the continuous rise
              | in rates reiterate usual forms of rationalisation.
              | "Groupwork", Group and Work in Workers' View
              | What do workers think about this new organisation, which is regarded as a
              | success by the union, supported by management, and considered by the two
              | parties as an innovation? How do they themselves analyse "groupwork"? In
              | their opinion, does "groupwork" re-found the category of work? Do they develop
              | a new vision of factory workers since the introduction of "groupwork"?
meta          | 3
text          | I tried to answer those questions by conducting interviews with production
              | workers and asking them what they themselves think about "groupwork"3. By
              | doing this, I was not seeking to collect information from workers' side that could
              | validate or not my own hypothesis, but I was willing to get access to workers'
              | opinion and statements on "groupwork". I considered workers as real interview
              | partners, as interlocutors.
              | In the following lines, I will focus on workers' understanding of "groupwork"
              | by identifying the meaning workers give to "groupwork" only from their own
              | statements. This is a specific anthropological enquiry framework, which material
              | only consists of workers' words and assertions.
              | I could resume workers' propositions with an apparently absurd sentence:
              | everything has changed, everything is exactly as it used to be. In each of the 29
              | interviews I conducted, workers' declarations on "groupwork" are built on
              | paradoxical affirmations such as "it is better... but it has not changed anything"
              | or "it is new... but we could already do that before". Workers' quotations are
              | organised as a network of successive oppositions, separations and
              | connections. By using simple words, that can be banal or surprising, workers
              | dismantle and deny "groupwork's" mechanisms and principles. They not only
              | have their own vision of "groupwork", but also their own idea of work and the
              | role of factory workers.
              | Two cleavages organise workers' point of view. Workers dissociate
              | "groupwork" from the period prior to the new organisation. They sometimes
              | underlie a fracture at the beginning of a new period, they also compare the new
              | organisation with the time before its implementation to soften "groupwork's"
              | innovative character... and they also point to a fundamental continuity. More
              | importantly, contrary to the combination that "groupwork" contains, workers do
              | distinguish group and work and analyse these two words separately. These two
              | cleavages can cross or part, and require the collection of successive clues from
              | the anthropologist as well as from the reader.

text          | I spent 7 weeks at Volkswagen in Hanover, in September and October
              | 1998. This time has been devoted to many commented visits of different
              | departments of the plants, to interviews with middle managers, engineers,
              | foremen, unions representatives, and with production workers. The
              | interviews with the workers were strictly confidential. They took place within
              | the factory, during working time, and lasted an average of two hours. They
              | were based on a precise questionnaire. These interviews have been
              | recorded and then transcripted word for word. Céline Bocquillon has helped
              | with the transcription.
              | Work and Group-Meetings: "we do more every day,
              | nothing has changed"
              | We've been working the hours in advance for the group-meetings. The times we need
              | for group-meetings, we've been working them in advance.4
              | This first quotation indicates, on the one hand that the substance of group-
              | meetings has got nothing to do with work, and on the other hand, that meetings,
              | or more precisely, their duration has a particular relationship to work. Meeting
              | hours result from work, they have been earned by work.
              | We work the entire week to get this group-meeting, because we have a little bit faster
              | tempo because of that [...]. For this group-meeting, the 12 cars that get lost, we build
              | them during the week after, so that it's not given to us in that sense, we're working for
              | it.
              | For the time we've been loosing today [for the group-meeting], we do a bit more every
              | day, nothing has changed, in my opinion, nothing has changed.
              | Working for the meeting means producing during the week the vehicles that get
              | lost because of the meeting, it means working at a higher speed. So that work
              | relates to a double reference: rates and production. The meeting itself is free
              | from production and rates, its duration however is subject of a conversion in
              | production volume. The meeting's "container" do not escape production
              | constraint. It is absolutely hold in this constraint and transposed into work
              | through rates increase.
              | As a consequence, the implementation of group-meetings – the "content" of
              | which refers to singular5 principles distinct from the categories that identify work
              | (see below) – affects the work, in the form of a raise in work's burden through
              | rates increase (we do a bit more). It does not break with the absolute primacy of
              | production in the factory: within the factory, each hour is equivalent to a certain
              | production volume. Time is the expression of production within the factory
              | (nothing has changed).

text          | Some workers propose a discharge of the expression "to work for the
              | meetings" and employ an unusual and surprising form, even in German: "we
              | are working us the meetings"6.
              | We are working us [the meetings] in advance.
              | We are working us the group-meeting, because we got a little bit higher tempo during
              | the 5 days of the week, precisely to get these 60 minutes of group-meeting.
              | We are working us, because of its unusual form, puts worker in the middle of
              | the relationship between work and meeting duration. On the one hand, workers
              | do realise the demanded effort to implement group-meeting without any
              | production loss. Rates increase signals an intensification of workers' own work.
              | But on the other hand, workers do benefit from this additional effort and from
              | the raise in productivity with one hour every week free of both production and
              | rates for group-meetings. One can read we are working us group-meetings as:
              | workers are working for workers. Workers then point out the originality of rates
              | increase following upon the introduction of group-meetings, and specify it.
              | Workers do work more, some of them even consider they benefit from this
              | additional work via group-meetings. In their own words, nothing indicates, this is
              | modifying their own vision of work. They even declare that nothing has
              | changed. Nevertheless the expression working for group-meetings suggests an
              | essential disjunction between work and meeting: meetings are no work. This
              | represents the first clue, the starting point. I will then first examine what workers
              | say and think of the group, afterwards I will come back to their own
              | understanding of work.
              | The Group and the Foreman:"these problems just happened to
              | become ours"
              | The only thing is that, if any problems happen, we don't mention it to the foreman, we
              | do that within the group now.
              | For the foremen, these problems are over... for 15 years, if any worker wasn't able to
              | do a job, [the foreman] had to see how to handle that, how to do, it was always his
              | concern, he doesn't have this concern anymore, these problems just happened to
              | become ours, I would say. The foreman may have other concerns, but we have to
              | settle these problems.
              | Just like a double, the group substitutes the foreman since "groupwork" has
              | been introduced, and one word circulates from one to the other: the word
              | problem. Independent from what it refers to, if problem is associated to foreman
              | and is then transmitted, or if problem is associated to group and has to be

              | solved, it is always the same problem. There is no innovation regarding what
              | problem means, just a transfer (these problems just happen to become ours).
              | The group itself is responsible for quality, parts, duration of breakdowns, and
              | responsible for spare parts and those kind of things.
              | The problems and responsibilities the groups now have to face are methodically
              | listed. They are always technical ones and relate to the daily management of
              | the production process.
              | The group can be identified as a new form of "first-line supervision"7. Workers
              | now have to face the responsibility to manage daily production on the shopfloor
              | themselves and to fulfil production goals fixed by the firm. Comparing
              | responsibilities and goals given to the new first-line supervision with the former
              | organisation there is no innovation. It only consists in the transfer of the
              | supervising function formerly exercised by the foremen to groups of workers.
              | As well as the foreman used to be one in the former period, the group is a
              | decision-taking authority.
              | We can decide our work ourselves, we don't have to ask the foreman before: are we
              | allowed to transfer this job here? But we simply do it, it's a resolution of the group and
              | that's it, of course it has to be voted, so that it's really a resolution of the group, it's
              | written in the group's book, but without this resolution it doesn't work.
              | Before the introduction of "groupwork", to have to, to ask, to be allowed to
              | identify the relationship with the foreman, that was characterised by submission
              | and subordination. Group, on the other hand, is referred to decide, do,
              | resolution. To decide is not completely hold in what has to be decided, but also
              | concerns the decision about how to decide. It means that the group itself
              | determines the principles of its decision-making process. The vote and the
              | resolution of the group identify a singular decision-making pattern based on the
              | examination of different opinions.
              | Yes, we are a group now, and now... we have to manage, now we have to build cars
              | properly on our own, well, before if anything happened, we spoke to the foreman, and
              | now it's within the group and during group-meetings, we discuss about it, and also
              | when we can do it, we correct it, when we have problems, but we can't fix everything,
              | we try.
              | The group is a debating place (we discuss). Workers speak and exchange
              | within the group. There is no unique solution but several conceivable solutions

text          | Under "first-line supervision", I understand the responsibility the foreman

              | training... so that the qualitative and quantitative production program fixed
              | by management can be properly carried out [Labit, 1998]. There are still
              | foremen in the factory, but their role and function have undergone major

              | possible solutions, the diverse opinions and refers to the determination to
              | explore them.
              | In accordance with the transfer of the role and function of the foremen to
              | the groups, the group is a decision-taking authority. The singular form of the
              | decision-making, however, differs from the way the foreman used to decide
              | before: the group is a deliberative authority. Workers actually oppose group to
              | foreman and show the specificity of the worker-group relationship based on
              | discussion, contrasting with the worker-foreman relationship based on
              | commandment. The previous system was a hierarchical one, the foreman was
              | the only one who could give his opinion, workers were formally in charge of
              | executing his orders, there was no interlocution. Within the new system,
              | workers can speak, and talk to each other, they are responsible for determining
              | the rules about how to manage the production on the shopfloor. Discussion is
              | the word specifying the originality of the new form of first-line supervision.
              | To discuss, to find a solution: the meeting represents the support as well as
              | the necessary condition for the new first-line supervision to fulfil its obligations.
              | If we have a problem, we can expose it properly during group-meeting, discuss, find a
              | solution [...], I find it great.
              | [During group-meetings] we talk about issues, we don't have time to talk about
              | otherwise. During the breaks, we just switch off during the breaks, we read, or we
              | bring a book or anything else. We don't feel like talking about work... and we do this
              | here, during group-meetings we can do that, during the work itself, we don't succeed
              | [in talking] either, it's loud out there, and we always have something to do, and if 5
              | persons gather together and talk about anything, a supervisor comes to say: "don't
              | you have anything else to do!" so that during group-meetings, we have the
              | opportunity to settle those things, it's important.
              | The group-meeting is the only occasion to talk and solve problems that the
              | group now has to face. The new first-line supervision is the "content" of group-
              | meetings. So that we have already solved a part of the enigma, namely specify
              | the substance of group-meetings: devoted to discussion and decision, the
              | group-meeting is the place of the new first-line supervision.
              | The Group on the Line: "we are forced to support our colleagues"
              | I find it good, because groupwork, actually it means the works have to be
              | accomplished within the group and not by each individual. Before, it was this idea: "I
              | go to work now, I do my work and it's OK". Think another way means that the works
              | should be accomplished within the group.
              | Before, doing the work is referred to I, in a vis-à-vis. About the accomplished
              | work, an explanation just had to be given to oneself – and formally to the
meta          | 8
text          | foreman – but nobody was forced to give any explanation to the other workers.
              | "Groupwork" has modified the rules, the group is now the frame and the "judge"
              | of work (the works have to be accomplished within the group), this has to be
              | taken into account (think another way).
              | Within groupwork, everyone should try, not to work for himself but for the group.
              | Everyone should be willing to help the others, or in my opinion, help the one that is
              | not really fit anymore, whose productivity is reduced. [...] We can't think each one only
              | for himself, but we have to think for the whole... If one of us doesn't accept it, it's back
              | to the old relationship.
              | The group initiates a new relationship among workers on the line. It is no more
              | an individualistic relationship only referring to oneself (work for himself) but an
              | open relationship including the other workers and their abilities (help the one
              | whose productivity is reduced, think for the whole). This new attitude has to be
              | shared by everybody, its original character specifically happens upon its sharing
              | out (if one of us doesn't accept it, it's back to the old relationship). It is however
              | a fragile arrangement dependent on each worker's willingness to submit to
              | common rules and to take care of the others (everyone should be willing).
              | Well I find it good that we work in the group and that everyone has to participate, and
              | that there are not some persons anymore who can stay in the background as they
              | used to do, because they found an easier job or anything else.
              | To have to participate is a new principle "groupwork" has inaugurated. It
              | demands every worker of the group to contribute and to co-operate on the line.
              | The group marks the end of reserved job, and leads to a more egalitarian
              | treatment of workers. Workers consider this as positive.
              | Not being able to stay in the background anymore, having to participate,
              | think for the whole... the group is not only an authority that is deliberating and
              | deciding rules applicable to everyone, but also a control authority, supervising
              | the execution of its decisions on the line. Beside discussion, the new first-line
              | supervision can be distinguished from the old one by two other essential issues.
              | On the one hand, the application of group decisions on the line does depend in
              | the end on the commitment of each individual worker. Opposite to the foreman,
              | the group has no formal sanction power towards its members8. On the other
              | hand, even if the group actually represents management on the shopfloor, and
              | even if it has to meet production goals, the group bases its collective rules on a
              | concern for other workers. Egalitarian treatment concerning job distribution,
              | mutual aid, support, and the implementation of the new first-line supervision is
              | built on a certain solidarity compatible with the firm's objectives.
meta          | 8
text          | However, the group has informal sanction means at its disposal, such as
              | refusing to give holidays at the period asked by the one that doesn't commit
              | to collective rules. Not all groups use those informal sanctions (see note 8).
meta          | 9
text          | Workers declare that the singular relationship based on a mutual aid duty
              | begins with "groupwork". As a consequence we should deduce that the group
              | founds an original solidarity and generates a new idea of workers' collective.
              | But, a certain amount of other quotations deny the novelty of the new
              | organisation concerning this point and a few other ones.
              | We have always been doing this: "it's exactly as it used to be"
              | We've always been doing this! Yes, I work on a line where actually nobody never said
              | "it's my job, I do my work, and the rest can manage", and I've never had this attitude.
              | When someone just started, and had difficulties on his job, I helped him as much as I
              | could, I always cared, does he pull through or not? And on our line, it's always been
              | like that, if somebody had an emergency, the other helped, it was always like this,
              | one did this, the other did this also, it was one and the same... actually it didn’t
              | change so many things.
              | The idea this worker has of the relationship among workers on the line has not
              | changed (this attitude). Mutual aid and support specify this relationship
              | according to which doing the work is not an individualistic concern one has for
              | the individual job he has been put on (it's my job, I do my work), but a larger
              | concern one has for the others and for the work the others have to perform (one
              | did this, the other did this also).
              | As we work, we also worked like that before, that one supports another. Let's say,
              | there were colleagues that did a work and didn't look to the right or to the left, and
              | there were also other ones that worked in collaboration, you can do your work on your
              | own for yourself, you can work together in collaboration.
              | There is a possible multiplicity of the relationship to the others at work. Work
              | can refer to one's own in an individual relation, or work can refer to together and
              | collaboration, in a relation that takes the other workers on the line into account.
              | However, this multiplicity is still valid today, as the use of the present tense
              | testifies it in the last part of the quotation (you can... you can...). As a
              | consequence, workers' relationship on the line is not determined by and
              | subordinated to an organisational framework, it is independent.
              | Workers' solidarity identified by support, mutual aid and collaboration on the
              | line is not induced by the introduction of "groupwork" but pre-exists it. And
              | despite the group, it is still possible to escape group's pressure9.

              | 10
text          | Groups can be ruled along very different lines. Some groups have
              | introduced no collective rules. Some other are governed by rules that
              | strictly apply to every members. Another kind of group introduced collective
              | rules but apply them considering each individual situation. For example, if a
              | worker wants to stay on the same job whereas the others rotate among
              | jobs, this can be allowed by the group, either temporary or for a long period
              | of time.
              | If we compare the quotations we just examined, with the ones we analysed
              | before (third paradox), we find a coherence and a tension. All those quotations
              | do argue that worker's relationship specified by support and mutual aid
              | particularly characterises the actual relation among workers within the factory.
              | But in the quotations claiming that this relationship begins with "groupwork", it is
              | then presented as a duty and an obligation: "we are forced to support our
              | colleagues". Whereas in the quotations affirming that this relationship was prior
              | to the group, it is identified as one possible relationship among others. The
              | distinction between obligation and possibility identifies the gap separating
              | "groupwork" with the period before its introduction.
              | Before "groupwork", support, mutual aid and collaboration are the words of
              | some workers. They only belong to workers, and refer to a certain solidarity
              | intending to implement local justice on the line. As a consequence "groupwork"
              | does not inaugurate workers' solidarity but marks its institutionalisation. So that
              | what was previously independently determined by workers, far from hierarchical
              | influence, becomes part of the normative framework of the new organisation.
              | This framework consists in the affirmation and the implementation of new rules
              | that can not be ignored.
              | However, if solidarity is a norm or a possibility, if support and mutual aid are
              | related to be forced to or to can, it does not modify what those words mean.
              | Even if the collaboration on the line is identified as new rule, its effective
              | implementation still belongs essentially to each worker's attitude. According to
              | the workers, the group does not inaugurate a new vision of what worker means
              | for them, it does not initiate a new solidarity within the factory, it does not modify
              | the vision of workers' collective.
              | Group-meetings and the new first-line supervision are the only elements of
              | "groupwork" to still be considered as innovating, at this point. But the following
              | quotations soften the originality of workers' own supervision.
              | In principle it's not bad... but I think we could already do that before groupwork, the
              | work was distributed indeed, but I learnt it like this, as I started here, we could say,
              | you do this work, I do this other one, we could already say that... yes that's it... it's not
              | a big difference, it's just called groupwork.
              | The novelty that "groupwork" initiates does not refer to an absolutely new
              | possibility (we could already) but only to its name (it's just called groupwork).
              | According to the old organisation, the foreman was formally in charge of
              | distributing men and tasks among the jobs (the work was distributed), the
              | implementation of the rule however offered some room for manoeuvre that the
              | workers invested.
              | We were also 8 colleagues on the line, at the beginning we were always doing each
              | one his job, but one day we said, why not a job further every day, so that we also
              | worked in circle, today here, tomorrow there, because the works are not the same,
meta          | 11
text          | there's always one guy who can this job better, other works maybe worse, that's why
              | we said the best is every day a job further, and we always worked in circle, you may
              | have a worse work today, but tomorrow you may have better, so that there is always
              | this equilibrium (DC: When did you do this?) Since... it was for the T2, around 1981...
              | We did that at once, ourselves, it came from us.
              | Jobs are different, workers' capacities are unequal, above all the satisfaction is
              | not the same on each job (worse/better work). In order to compensate for these
              | inequalities, workers decided to implement job rotation, fifteen years before the
              | official introduction of "groupwork". As a consequence, neither workers'
              | initiatives, nor job rotation and workers' preoccupation for supervision issues
              | intending to achieve equity on the line have been initiated by the new
              | organisation in absolute terms.
              | The initiative conducing to the implementation of job rotation actually rests
              | on the category of equilibrium, and intends to prevent some workers to be
              | disadvantaged on the long run because of a particularly unpleasant and difficult
              | job whereas others would be systematically advantaged. This initiative is based
              | on a conception of work according to which other workers and their own
              | feelings about their work is essential.
              | Regarding supervision, the innovation of "groupwork" rests on its formal
              | implementation. Despite the clear separation between workers' and foremen's
              | role imposed by the old organisation, some workers already felt concerned
              | about the daily management of production, and did not exclusively leave this
              | task to the foreman. The new organisation relies on those sporadic initiatives,
              | extend them and give them the statute of a norm. "Groupwork" actually signifies
              | a rupture by formally constituting the group as a decision-taking authority, and
              | by granting a weekly meeting to the group, so that it is able to fulfil its
              | supervision role.
              | As they do it concerning solidarity, workers limit the innovation of
              | "groupwork" to the rule that management and works council decree. According
              | to them, "groupwork's" novelty only refers to the new organisational and
              | normative framework. They deny this framework the ability to have any effect
              | on their own subjectivity. The following quotation clearly presents this point:
              | But it was exactly like that before, I mean, but it used to come from us, [...] it didn't
              | change anything, it's the same thing, but now it's just ordered from above and before
              | it came from the colleagues themselves.
              | This does not mean however that workers do not take care of these new rules.
              | They expose those rules' mechanism with a remarkable analytical precision and
              | a detailed examination that show the attention workers have for these rules.
              | They assume the new prerogatives: they meet, deliberate and decide. They are
              | pretty satisfied, one of them even declares "it's great". Very few of them wish to
              | come back to the old organisation. But neither solidarity and justice on the line,
meta          | 12
text          | nor their own vision of worker, or their own idea of work (see below) have been
              | affected by the new organisation.
              | "It's called 'groupwork', but in the end we work exactly as we used to
              | do before"
              | [Groupwork] is a good thing, a very good thing, yes because people are more
              | required, but the work, the work on the product is the same, the indirect tasks, this
              | has become much more interesting what we have to organise ourselves, the indirect
              | things.
              | Those from the top can say "now it's groupwork" or not, the only thing that comes on
              | top of this are group-meetings, but actually... I know what is always told about
              | groupwork... but in fact it's just this word, in the end the work remains the same, if it’s
              | written groupwork on it or not, it’s actually... nevertheless it remains because we have
              | our rates, our time instructions, our work.
              | It's just like before, it's called precisely groupwork but in the end we work as we also
              | used to work before, without 'first worker', but the work progress and all this, it has not
              | changed a lot, it's called groupwork, but if you look carefully, it's the same thing as
              | before.
              | These quotations illuminate the fundamental distinction between work and
              | "groupwork". "Groupwork" is referred to organisational tasks, to group-
              | meetings, to a change in the hierarchy on the shopfloor (without 'first worker'),
              | that is to the new first-line supervision. Workers do not consider "groupwork" as
              | work, and according to them "groupwork" has no effect on work. Therefore, the
              | expression "groupwork" is even inadequate and designated as a simple
              | appellation (it's just this word), or rejected as strange to workers' vocabulary
              | (those from the top can say "now it's groupwork"). The work is said to be the
              | same. Product, rates, work progress (decided by planning engineers, work
              | progress contains the description of the tasks and the time given to accomplish
              | them) identify, regarding work, what remains unchanged in spite of the new
              | organisation. Those are issues on which workers still do not have any influence.
              | We have already seen, from the first paradox, that the new first-line supervision
              | did not lead to any fundamental modification concerning time as the expression
              | of production within the factory. We should note that the foreman has never
              | been responsible for rates and for the speed of the line. As a consequence, it is
              | not amazing that the new first-line supervision, only based on the transfer of the
              | role of the foreman to the group, does not lead to change this point.
              | Even if work appears in a list, near rates, time instructions and work
              | progress, it is not reduced to those terms.
              | I had to do my work, I can do it in a group or I can do it like before in an established
              | rule [...] it hasn't changed a lot until now.
meta          | 13
text          | In my opinion, it's the same work, the same thing. For me it's exactly like before. I
              | also have to do my work, in groupwork or differently.
              | To have to do one's work like before splits with the new normative framework
              | that has been implemented by management and works council, and with the
              | advent of the group as a decision-taking authority. The foreman can decree
              | arbitrary instructions, workers can deliberate about the best way to do the work
              | before taking any decision, this is of no influence regarding the statement I have
              | to do my work. To have to do one's work like before proposes a subjectivation
              | of the category of work supplanting concrete changes that occurred within the
              | factory: rise in rates, job rotation, questioned hierarchy, new organisation but
              | also the rule (in a group... in an established rule). This distance from the rule is
              | probably the most significant element. All along their remarks and even in those
              | ones, workers actually identify "groupwork" as a new set of rules.
              | In those quotations, to have to only refers to I, as a self-requisition
              | concerning work, absolutely heterogeneous and independent from the new
              | formal rules in force within the factory. To have to do one's work is conjugated
              | in singular, it does not found any collective or group. It irreducibly identifies a
              | subjective and essential attitude for workers in the factory. To have to do one's
              | work specifies an unvarying form of workers' awareness, which principles and
              | categories are strange to organisational modifications that occurred in the plant.
              | The category of work refers to multiple conceptions and leads to very
              | different statements, depending on which quotation we examine. None of these
              | statements however is affected by the transfer of the foreman's responsibility
              | regarding daily management of the production to the group and by the
              | implementation of a weekly group-meeting. Contrary to what management and
              | works council argue, "groupwork" does not renew the singular terms of the
              | category of work thought by the workers.
              | Resolution
              | Workers propose an original idea of "groupwork" that questions the specific title
              | of this new organisation. Their points of view actually demand an alternative
              | name that would better account for the field and the limits of the new
              | organisation. But we will first come back to workers' propositions and
              | systematically and separately resume what group, on the one hand, and work,
              | on the other hand, mean for them.
              | Concerning the group, workers' words are clear. The group is the new
              | name of supervision on the shopfloor. It is an executive and decision-taking
              | authority, but also a deliberative one. Compared to the old supervision,
              | deliberation is the only novelty. Group-meeting can not be dissociated from the
meta          | 14
text          | new first-line supervision, it is its necessary condition as well as an essential
              | tool for its implementation. Otherwise, it consists only on a transfer of
              | responsibilities. This transfer has affected neither workers’ solidarity nor the will
              | to install a certain justice on the line, although the group formally represents
              | management on the shopfloor. The innovation of this new form of production
              | management strictly locates in its normative statute decreed by management
              | and works council. Long before these two parties decide to officially grant the
              | supervision to workers called together in groups, some workers already cared
              | for those questions, sometimes in a remarkable way, and went so far as to
              | negotiate with the foreman the implementation of job rotation.
              | As for the word work, it relies on multiple conceptions that we should
              | consider separately. These conceptions have in common that they are not
              | affected by the institutionalisation of the group. However they do not add up,
              | and do not merge. Work is no concept but a 'problematic word': "a word about
              | which there is a conflict of statements, that is a conflict of thesis and arguments.
              | Each statement supports a distinct order of the real. The statement can be
              | materialised or at stake, it is however essentially identified as an intellectuality,
              | that means as a thesis, a principle" [Lazarus, 1998: 12]. In workers' statements,
              | four different conceptions have to be distinguished. If they evoke the group, the
              | mutual aid on the line, and their own preoccupation about production
              | management, work refers to the concrete job to which each worker is appointed
              | and to the tasks one has to accomplish on this job (the works are not the same,
              | do the works in the group, you do this work, I do this other one). Work actually
              | fits in a concrete and objective vision. On the second hand, if workers declare
              | that they "work the hours for group-meetings in advance", work is specified by
              | rates (we have a little bit faster tempo). The time identifies and characterises
              | the relationship between work and production. In this case, work is referred to
              | the objective dimension of production, and to the subjective operation according
              | to which time expresses production within the factory. The statement "the work
              | is the same" proposes another different conception of work. According to this
              | conception, work refers to an instruction workers have no influence on, and just
              | have to implement, that is an external principle (time instructions, work
              | progress, product). Finally, when they argue "I have to do my work like before",
              | workers develop a subjective and internal proposition, a self-requisition,
              | independent from any external reference.
              | Beyond the words and specific categories identifying them, work and group
              | can be distinguished, owing to the conclusion that one is a problematic word,
              | and the other refers to an external norm that belongs to an organisational
              | framework.
              | The analysis of the paradoxical propositions of the workers about
              | "groupwork" validates the statement "workers think", which argues that thinking
              | is irreducible to nothing else than itself and can not be determined by
meta          | 15
text          | management attitude, concrete changes or norms [Lazarus, 1996: 67]. The end
              | of the investigation actually leads to discover essential and subjective
              | categories (support, mutual aid, to have to do one's work) that are thought and
              | developed without referring to the new organisational framework, or to the
              | concrete and objective changes that came from it. The disjunction between
              | workers' subjectivity and forms of organisation however does not lead to
              | condemn "groupwork" as such. But it invalidates the position some sociologists
              | adopt by proposing a dialectical analysis of these new forms of organisation and
              | by arguing they affect workers' consciousness, either in a positive way
              | [Kuhlmann, Schumann, 2000] or in a negative one [Moldaschl, 1994].
              | Based on the analysis of workers' statements, I propose to adopt the
              | appellation "team production"10. This term indeed helps us to avoid any
              | confusion about the renewing of the meaning of workers' collective or not, and
              | about the eventual changes concerning the category of work, as we showed
              | that none of them have been questioned by the new organisation. With "team
              | production", the new organisational framework only refers to the management
              | of production by teams, on the shopfloor – that is the exact extent to which
              | workers limit it.
              | 10 Team production here has to be distinguished with the way Appelbaum and
              | Batt [1994] use this term. For Appelbaum and Batt, "team production" refers
              | to a particular production system as a whole including work organisation but
              | also relationship with suppliers for example, whereas here it only
              | characterises a specific form of management of production on the
              | shopfloor.
