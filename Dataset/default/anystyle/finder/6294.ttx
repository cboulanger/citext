              | Using Financial Markets to Analyze History:
              | The Case of the Second World War
              | Bruno S. Frey & Daniel Waldenström ∗
              | Abstract: »Vom Nutzen der Analyse von Finanzmärkten für
              | die Geschichtswissenschaft. Eine Untersuchung anhand des
              | 2. Weltkrieges«. This article presents the analysis of finan-
              | cial markets as a supplementary method to the traditional
              | historiographic approach by investigating the perception of
              | events before and during World War II. This approach con-
              | stitutes an alternative to written sources, which are often bi-
              | ased and commonly do not represent the opinions held in
              | the wider public. In the following, the financial markets ap-
              | proach is used to analyse the perception and anticipation of
              | events before and during the World War II in France, Ger-
              | many, Denmark, and Norway. Thereby, price data of long-
              | term government bonds for these countries traded in Zurich
              | and Stockholm are used. The presented evidence challenges
              | some common held views, e.g., it can be shown that the in-
              | vasion of Norway was in part anticipated by contemporar-
              | ies. Although both methods rely on interpretation the finan-
              | cial markets approach is based on a fundamentally different
              | type of source. Therefore, it can be used as a supplement to
              | the traditional approach.
              | 1. How are countries affected by wars?
              | A central aspect of historical research is to provide explanations for the causes
              | and effects of events that occurred in the past. In order to be more concrete, a

text          | major war, in particular the Second World War, will be considered such a
              | historical event. History can be analyzed and explained from different perspec-
              | tives. This paper considers two such perspectives, the first being the traditional
              | historiographic approach, in which the main emphasis is on the qualitative
              | analysis of various kinds of historical sources and documents, and the second
              | being what we call the financial market approach, a recent methodology for
              | linking significant changes in historical market prices to simultaneously occur-
              | ring geopolitical events. This study seeks to identify the fundamental character-
              | istics of the two approaches and how they compare in answering some impor-
              | tant historical questions concerning the Second World War.
              | Historians of the Second World War generally ask many important ques-
              | tions in order to comprehend the main causes of war and its impact on societies
              | and their citizens. This study focuses on three of these questions, which are
              | suitable for analysis using historical financial market data. The first question is:
              | How are countries affected by wars? This is a broad, descriptive question,
              | aimed at characterizing the war’s main course of events, with special attention
              | given to the idiosyncratic elements in the histories of different countries. The
              | second question is: Did the contemporaries anticipate the outbreak of the war?
              | This question does not focus on the actual war, but rather on the period just
              | before its outbreak and, more precisely, on the existence of threat assessments
              | among the contemporaries. There are many possible answers, depending what
              | groups in society are targeted. For example, the perceived threat of war on the
              | part of political and military leaders might (for informational or other reasons)
              | differ from the threat of war perceived by the general public. Both groups are
              | worth considering, particularly the latter, since it constitutes quite an important
              | group in democratic societies when analyzing a country’s actions. Our third
              | question is: What were the important turning points of the war? This is an issue
              | that all war historiographies like to dwell upon, and the answer could be sig-
              | nificant. According to historians, a turning point is typically the first event in a
              | series of incidents that eventually turn out to be important for the outcome of
              | the war. Still, if one wishes to highlight the turning points that were regarded as
              | important at the time of the war by the contemporaries actively engaged in it,
              | an entirely unique set of dates may show up as turning points. Even if these
              | events turn out later not to have any lasting impact on the war, they may be
              | crucial in understanding the decisions made by people at the time. Hence, de-
              | pending on the focus of the research question, it may vary as to which approach
              | is most suitable.
              | Section II of this paper presents a critical discussion of the two analytical
              | perspectives under comparison in this study: the traditional historiography
              | approach and the financial market approach. Specific emphasis will be put on
              | describing the latter, since the former has been the conventional standard
              | among historians for a long time and needs no further introduction. Section III
              | exemplifies the financial market approach for the case of the Second World

text          | War as reflected in the secondary market for government bonds, which is stud-
              | ied for various countries. Section IV presents the results from the empirical
              | analysis of bond market prices, and Section V presents a comparison between
              | these results and the conventional historiographic approach. The final Section
              | VI offers conclusions. It will be argued that both approaches rely heavily on
              | interpretation – but in different ways. They therefore complement each other in
              | a useful way. The analysis of financial markets for highlighting historical
              | events is seen as a useful addition to the historians’ tools. It certainly cannot
              | substitute for standard analysis, but constitutes an interesting new way of ana-
              | lyzing history.
              | 2. Two Analytical Approaches
              | History may be analyzed from several perspectives. This study considers two
              | such perspectives. First, in the dominant traditional historiography, which we
              | will outline only briefly (for more thorough investigations, see, e.g., Garraghan,
              | 1946 or Howell and Prevenier, 2001), we point out the problems it has with
              | providing answers to some of the war questions asked in the introduction.
              | Second, we present the more recent methodology, based on analyzing prices
              | recorded on historical financial markets. This section identifies the fundamen-
              | tal distinguishing characteristics.
              | 2.1 Traditional historiography
              | Historians deal with past economic and political events in a certain way. Typi-
              | cally, they carefully collect facts and interpret them in the light of their general
              | knowledge of the field and the particular circumstances prevailing. A major
              | problem with this approach is that the interpretation of historians is necessarily
              | ex post facto, i.e., with knowledge of later events. This knowledge may bias the
              | evaluation of the events, and may lead to “facts” being overlooked or overem-
              | phasized, as the case may be. This problem is most obvious in the case of wars.
              | Once the outcome is known, resulting, for example, in the crushing defeat of
              | the country being considered, it is difficult to objectively analyze why the
              | decision-makers of the country engaged in the war in the first place. To simply
              | refer to a misjudgment is unsatisfactory, because it would require an explana-
              | tion of how such an error could occur. In order to evaluate the historical situa-
              | tion existing at any given moment in time, historians have to take care not to
              | impute information to the decision-makers of that time, the true nature of
              | which was only revealed by later developments.
meta          | 332
text          | Historians are, of course, well aware of this problem and they make a big ef-
              | fort to capture the information, views, sentiments and feelings existing at a
              | given point in time.1 Written documents are a major source, but sometimes
              | surveys are used (oral history). Both approaches may be biased by the strategic
              | considerations of the writers and orators. In many cases, the sources have been
              | written or spoken in support of a particular cause, and are therefore far from
              | reflecting the reality of the situation. In other cases, the authors of documents
              | or interviews made a special effort to get themselves into a more prominent
              | position, or place themselves in a more beneficial light, again not reflecting the
              | true situation.
              | Historians tend to focus almost exclusively on various kinds of qualitative
              | methods and written sources, such as letters, memoirs, diaries, newspaper arti-
              | cles etc. Since most of these written pieces of historical evidence reflect the
              | views of the individuals who have written them, focusing on this method is not
              | really suitable for drawing conclusions about views and opinions of the general
              | public in the past. In fact, historians cannot even analyze the views of smaller
              | groups in the population in the absence of comparable and contemporaneous
              | statements of all the individuals in question. Hence, by mainly focusing on
              | making careful in-depth analyses of recorded source materials, historians will
              | have a hard time of robustly reproducing the widely held views of people in the
              | past concerning various interesting phenomena, such as the existence of pre-
              | war threats or the credibility of a government’s policies in the eyes of its con-
              | stituency.
              | 2.2 The financial markets approach
              | In recent years, there has been a growing literature on analyzing political and
              | institutional change using historical financial market data. Treating financial
              | markets primarily as markets for the dissemination and distribution of informa-
              | tion, it is possible to derive measures of the impact of political, economic and
              | institutional changes on the prices of financial assets. A path-breaking analysis
              | shows how events during the U.S. civil war affected the market for “green-
              | backs”, a special currency issued by the Union (Willard et al. 1996). A number
              | of subsequent studies applied this approach to the prices of government bonds
              | being traded during the Second World War. Frey and Kucher (2000, 2001)
              | made the first studies, analyzing prices in the neutral country of Switzerland.
              | Following them, Brown and Burdekin (2002) studied German bonds being
              | traded in wartime Britain, and Frey and Waldenström (2004) compared the
              | prices of German and Belgian bonds traded simultaneously on the neutral Zu-
              | 1 For example, in his famous treatise on history, E. H. Carr describes the writing of history as
              | a “continuous process of interaction between the historian and his facts” (Carr 1961: ch. 1).
meta          | 333
text          | rich and Stockholm stock exchanges. Oosterlinck (2003) analyzed the French
              | government bond market during the same period, comparing the prices of pre-
              | war bonds with bonds issued by the Vichy regime in order to infer the timing
              | of the turning point of the war according to French bond traders. Wolfers and
              | Zitzewitz (2005) studied the case of the Iraq war.
              | The basic methodology followed in all of these papers is to link significant
              | changes, called structural break points (see the technical discussion below), in
              | the market prices of these financial assets to simultaneously occurring political
              | or military events, from which an inference can be made about the impact of
              | these events on contemporary society.2 The financial assets that have been most
              | commonly analyzed in the literature are government bond prices and yields.
              | The underlying idea is that wars put extraordinary pressure on a country’s
              | fiscal balances and may, in the worst case, provoke sovereign repudiations or
              | defaults. This, in turn, increases the default risk of these government bonds,
              | which implies that they should trade at lower prices on the secondary markets.3
              | The use of capital market data for these analyses has several advantages.
              | Market actors have always had to carefully evaluate the prevailing situation, as
              | well as likely future developments, because errors directly affect them in mone-
              | tary terms. This distinguishes capital market data from other types of data, in
              | particular surveys and questionnaires, where errors do not generally affect the
              | persons committing them. Financial markets usually have a high predictive
              | power, due to so-called marginal traders. This type of trader decides on a rela-
              | tively unbiased basis, and carefully collects the relevant information. In the
              | extreme case, even one such trader can drive the market price to the underlying
              | equilibrium price.
              | Financial markets thus are not per se related to the nation and population. A
              | nation may disappear, but the respective financial assets may survive. Nor-
              | mally, there is a strong correlation between the fate of a population and/or
              | nation and the values of assets traded. In most cases, when a nation ceases to
              | exist, its public debt is no longer serviced nor paid back at maturity, a fact
              | reflected in the financial markets by a drop in value to zero (if there is no hope
              | 2 The overlap between, on one hand, the general public and political and military decision
              | makers and, on the other, the bond traders and investors, is admittedly far from perfect. Yet
              | both the public and the market participants acted to a significant extent on publicly avail-
              | able information, and one would expect their views and expectations about the future to be
              | roughly the same. As the political and military leaders had partial access to information
              | from the secret services that was not available to the general public, it will be discussed to
              | what extent their views differed from those of the public.
              | 3 These developments may be accompanied by minor changes in other standard bond yield
              | determinants, such as the coupon rate, the time to maturity, tax status of cash flows, re-
              | demption clauses and the discount rate. Although these were mostly constant, the breaks
              | estimated use yield spreads (subtracting the Swedish yields), hence cancelling out market-
              | specific determinants. These estimations produced essentially the same results, and are
              | available from the authors upon request.
meta          | 334
text          | that the debt will ever be repaid). Similarly, if the population of a country is
              | negatively affected (say by natural catastrophes or a war), the respective gov-
              | ernment may be unable to service its public debt, so that the population’s fate is
              | again reflected in the financial market.
              | The possible split between the fate of the population and the nation, as re-
              | flected on financial markets, may be advantageous or disadvantageous, depend-
              | ing on the question asked. In any case, one must be very careful when estab-
              | lishing a relationship between historical events and movements on financial
              | markets. It may be spurious, or change over time, so that any interventions may
              | be misleading.
              | We hasten to emphasize that we have never considered the analysis of fi-
              | nancial markets to be a substitute for the traditional inquiries undertaken by
              | historians. But it is a challenging complementary method of evaluating the
              | situation at a given moment in time. In particular, care must be taken to allow
              | for time delays. Thus, a historical fact may have been predicted in advance by
              | the people active on the financial markets, in which case the break should be
              | visible before the event, or be completely absent, depending on the speed of
              | adjustment. Either way, no break is visible at the time of the event itself. Ex-
              | amples are the outbreak and end of a war, which in many cases are foreseen
              | well in advance. It should be noted, however, that financial markets tend to
              | overreact to news reaching them. The overreaction hypothesis implies that,
              | even though many investors predicted an event way in advance, and financial
              | markets adjusted accordingly, a break in the price series can still be identified.
              | There are a number of technical considerations to be taken into account
              | when using financial market data. The most important of these are the choice of
              | econometric method used to statistically estimate so-called structural breaks in
              | the time series of each financial asset, and the specific model of asset prices
              | chosen for the computations. There are a large number of statistical methods
              | for estimating structural breaks in time series. 4 The results in this study are
              | based on two of the most common methods in the literature for the estimation
              | of multiple structural breaks in univariate time series: Banerjee et al. (1992)
              | and Bai and Perron (1998, 2003). Technically, a structural break is defined as a
              | lasting significant mean-shift in the series analyzed. Both the researcher and the
              | total length of the series determine exactly how long the structural breaks
              | should be.5 The great advantage of these methods is that they estimate the
              | breaks, using only the information contained in the time series properties and
              | not the prior knowledge of what historical events historians consider impor-
              | 4 For comprehensive overviews of the time series econometrics of estimating structural
              | breaks, see Perron (2006).
              | 5 Determining the required length of a structural break is associated with the trade-off of
              | avoiding both short fluctuations and too long breaks that run the risk of containing more
              | than one “true” break.

text          | tant.6 This means that the financial market approach is particularly suitable for
              | analyzing the true forward-looking assessments of the contemporaries, before
              | the subsequent realization of the course of events that later became historical.
              | We now turn to the second technical consideration mentioned above: the
              | specification of a model of asset prices. The results presented below are based
              | on modeling structural breaks in nominal bond prices or bond yields that are
              | conditional on shifts in other nominal prices or yields. The term “conditional”
              | has to be emphasized since the procedure corrects for effects that influence all
              | government bonds traded in a similar way. Therefore, we will not find breaks
              | in, say, the German government bond prices as a result of changing inflation or
              | real interest rates. This also holds for mean differences: we only test for signifi-
              | cant structural mean breaks of the bond prices conditional on price movements
              | of all government bonds traded in Switzerland. This means that an (historical)
              | event with the same effect on the bond prices of all countries will not be recog-
              | nized by the econometric method used. It also means that an event that leads to,
              | say, a ten percent increase in the Swiss government bond prices, and to a five
              | percent increase in the prices of all government bonds, will be shown to in-
              | crease the conditional mean of the Swiss government prices by five percent
              | only.
              | The analysis of break points undertaken here does not identify historical
              | facts, but rather the acquisition and assessment of information relevant for
              | bondholders. Wartime events are evaluated with respect to how likely they are
              | to affect the probability of having the government bonds correctly serviced and
              | repaid. Thus, bond traders do not attempt to pin down what happens for its own
              | sake, or for some historical reason, but in order to predict what will happen to
              | the bonds they own, or intend to acquire. Some events are important to bond
              | investors and influence bond prices, while other events do not affect the per-
              | ceived probability to service and repay the debt, and therefore are not reflected
              | in bond prices.
              | The financial market approach is based on the premise that “facts” consid-
              | ered important by historians are reflected in changing values on capital mar-
              | kets, in particular by bond prices. However, there are a number of reasons why
              | historical “facts” may not show up as break points:
              | - A “fact” may be important from the historian’s point of view (it relates
              | to the fate of a nation, country or population), but does not affect the
              | servicing and payback of the government bonds.
              | - The contemporary actors do not evaluate a particular event in the same
              | way as historians do decades later. This difference between ex ante and
              | 6 The methods distinguish themselves from so-called “Chow tests” for structural breaks, in
              | which a break point is determined beforehand and evaluated accordingly. Perron (2006)
              | shows how this approach to the estimation of structural breaks yields invalid and inconsis-
              | tent results.

text          | ex post assessments is a natural characteristic of all kinds of human
              | action, but few methods are able to capture it.
              | - A “fact” does not exist, nor is it as important as the historians believe.
              | Here, the quality of historical research is called into question. However,
              | it would be misleading to assume that all historians identify the same
              | “facts” as being important. So the issue is which historical school or
              | which individual historian has identified what historical “fact”, as well
              | as the actual importance attributed to it.
              | - The bond market data lacks quality, e.g. because there are too few
              | transactions.
              | - Governments have intervened in the bond market, either as buyers or
              | sellers, or by imposing controls of some sort. An important case occurs
              | when governments want to prevent the reflection of a political (or
              | economic) event on financial markets.
              | - The econometric analysis is unable to identify break points relating to
              | historical events, even though they are in the data.
              | The next two sections illustrate the financial market approach by looking at
              | a particular case, namely how the Nazis’ rise to power and the Second World
              | War were reflected in the government bonds of France, Germany, Denmark
              | and Norway.
              | 3. The Example of World War II
              | Changes in financial values reflect historical events. The historical events con-
              | sidered here refer to a period starting with Hitler’s rise to power after his ap-
              | pointment as chancellor of the Reich on January 30, 1933 and including the
              | first years of World War II. The analysis is based on newly collected price data
              | of long-term government bonds for France, Germany, Denmark and Norway.7
              | These prices were continuously quoted at this time on the financial markets in
              | Stockholm and Zurich. All the nations directly or indirectly involved in the
              | Second World War heavily interfered in, or even closed, their stock and bond
              | exchanges. For reasons of neutrality, however, the Swiss and Swedish govern-
              | ments refrained from doing so and their financial markets therefore remained
              | open and unrestricted for the entire wartime period.8
              | There are some differences between the two data samples. First, they cover
              | somewhat different time periods, with the German and French bonds in Zurich
              | 7 For details on the bond data, see Frey and Kucher (2000) for the German and French bonds,
              | and Waldenström and Frey (2007) for the Danish and Norwegian bonds.
              | 8 The Zurich Stock Exchange remained closed for two months following the German attack
              | on the West in May and June 1940.

text          | being analyzed from 1933 to 1948, and the Danish and Norwegian bonds
              | traded in Stockholm only being analyzed from 1938 to 1940, i.e., the period
              | right before and around the outbreak of the War. Naturally, this difference
              | implies that the two samples allow for different historical questions, with the
              | Nordic bond data primarily being suitable for the study of pre-war threat as-
              | sessments, and the German and French series allowing for broader inquiry.
              | Moreover, the Zurich data are observed on a monthly basis while the Stock-
              | holm data are weekly. This difference in frequency does not matter greatly for
              | the historical analysis, except for the slightly higher amount of detail in the
              | timing of the estimated breaks in the Stockholm sample.
              | The relationship between historical events and capital market developments
              | is looked at from two different perspectives. On the one hand: To what extent
              | are changes in government bond values related to historical events? Do breaks
              | in such capital values series correspond to what have been established as cru-
              | cial events in the Second World War? Or are there breaks in the capital values
              | series which cannot (or at least not easily) be related to War events? On the
              | other hand: To what extent are historical events reflected in the form of
              | changes in the values of government bonds? Do capital values rise or fall, and
              | how large and significant are the changes? Are bonds issued by the various
              | governments affected in the same or in a differentiated way? The answers to
              | these questions may throw new light on the Second World War.
              | Some historical events are generally undisputed, and their dating creates few
              | problems. In our context, an example would be Hitler’s appointment to chan-
              | cellor, which occurred on January 30, 1933. Similarly, the unconditional ca-
              | pitulation of the Wehrmacht took place in Reims on May 7, 1945, and was
              | repeated on May 9, 1945 in Berlin. Great care must nevertheless be taken not to
              | distort the past. In particular, when decisions made by people in the past are
              | evaluated, the much more limited knowledge existing at that particular time
              | must be taken into account. This is particularly evident when decisions turn out
              | to be wrong. Ex post facto, it is not easy, for instance, to understand why Hitler
              | and his Wehrmacht invaded the Soviet Union, because, according to what we
              | know from subsequent historical events, a defeat was almost inevitable. Histo-
              | rians are skilled and make an effort to overcome these dangers by carefully
              | studying official and private documents, such as diaries, which are likely to be
              | representative of the situation at a particular moment of time. But it is also well
              | known that such documents are already the result of a selection process (with
              | mainly those documents considered “important” being preserved), and some of
              | them are even rewritten after the fact.

              | 4.1 Germany
              | Figure 1 displays the German government bond prices for the period 1933-
              | 1948. Over the whole period, there is a strong downturn of the value of German
              | government bonds traded in Switzerland. This also holds for the period 1933-
              | 1936, i.e. for the first years of the Third Reich. The drop in bond values be-
              | tween 1933 and 1935 may be attributed to the fact that bond holders may have
              | feared that the Nazis would renegotiate foreign debt, or simply stop repayment.
              | This fear was fuelled by official policy pronouncements advocating extreme
              | autarchy, which indicated that the Nazis would withdraw from the international
              | capital markets (Köllner 1982). In addition, heavy intervention in, and strict
              | regulations imposed on, the capital markets on the part of Hitler’s government
              | depressed the expectations of the bond holders, who suffered a decline in their
              | returns (German economic policy in the pre-war and war period is discussed in
              | e.g. Boelcke 1985, Köllner 1982).

              | The partial recovery in 1937 and 1938 may be attributed to the (short-term)
              | success of the expansionary fiscal policy (undertaken for rearmament pur-
              | poses): national income picked up, and unemployment fell sharply. A morato-
meta          | 339
text          | rium on servicing foreign debt was imposed in the summer of 1933, but at the
              | same time the government paid back foreign debts in an effort to become as
              | autarchic as possible against foreign countries (again for military reasons). The
              | Nazi government thereby gained some extent of financial respectability with
              | foreign investors in 1937-38.
              | Hitler’s aggressive foreign policy and increasing isolation led to a drastic
              | fall in German bond prices from the middle of 1938 to the end of 1939, when
              | the Second World War broke out. The bond traders feared that the impending
              | war would reduce Germany’s willingness and ability to service and repay its
              | foreign debt. Again there was a rise in the value of German government bonds
              | after the successful Blitzkrieg at the beginning of 1940. But it did not last long:
              | from the second half of 1941 on, there was a permanent fall in German bond
              | values, suggesting that the actors on the bond market expected early on that the
              | Nazis would lose the war, that the debt would no longer be serviced and that
              | the capital would be lost.
              | The econometric analysis identifies six break points for Germany. Table 1
              | gives a survey of resulting break points and the corresponding percent changes
              | in the conditional mean price index.

              | Breaks are estimated using the method of Banerjee et al. (1992).
              | German government bonds experienced a statistically significant and large
              | upward surge, beginning in the summer and autumn of 1936. In July/August of
              | that year, the conditional average index rose by 8 percent relative to the condi-
              | tional mean, i.e. the average development of all other government bonds traded
              | on the Swiss market. This might be attributed to The Olympic Games, which
              | were held in Berlin in August 1936, and which made the Nazi regime look
              | peaceful to many observers.
              | In mid-March 1939, the Nazis invaded the remaining parts of the Czecho-
              | slovak Republic (after the Sudetenland was given to them at the Munich Con-
              | ference, September 29, 1938). According to many historians (e.g., Weinberg,
meta          | 340
text          | 1994), it heralded the beginning of the Second World War. The government
              | bond markets support this interpretation of history. The value of German gov-
              | ernment bonds fell by no less than 17 percent compared to the average market
              | values. The actors thus lost even more confidence in the German government’s
              | capacity to service and pay back its bonds (which had already been seriously
              | hampered before). The invasion of the Czechoslovak Republic was the first
              | time Hitler annexed territory beyond the “German” borders, which was taken
              | as an indication that he would not stop there, and that it was likely that a major
              | war would be started. However, some amount of uncertainty remained; some
              | actors on capital markets obviously thought that the annexation of the Czecho-
              | slovak Republic would satisfy Hitler’s demands. Accordingly, the value of
              | German government bonds dropped only half as much as when the Second
              | World War “officially” began on September 1, 1939 with German troops in-
              | vading Poland. The actual start of the war sent German government bonds
              | plummeting down 39 percent. The capital market was extremely pessimistic
              | about the prospects of a German victory.
              | The Swiss stock exchange was closed in May/June 1940, so that the effect
              | of the German Blitzkrieg-victories is not reflected in the data.
              | The fourth structural break is identified in November/December 1941, but
              | the decline of average bond prices is rather small (around 5 percent). It reflects
              | a major war event, namely the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7,
              | 1941) and the subsequent declarations of war by the United States (and the
              | United Kingdom) on Japan, and by Germany (and Italy) on the United States
              | (December 8 and 11, respectively).
              | Yet another significant drop in German bond values (again about 6 percent)
              | occurred in November 1942. In that month, the Soviet troops started a large
              | counter-offensive against the German 6th Army and parts of the 4th Panzer
              | Army, encircling more than 300,000 German troops at Stalingrad. Traders on
              | the Swiss capital market considered the launching of the offensive as having a
              | more negative affect on Germany’s future ability to service and repay its debt
              | than the capitulation by field marshal Friedrich Paulus three months later (Feb-
              | ruary 2, 1943).
              | The last break point indicated by the data took place towards the end of the
              | war, in February 1945. At the Yalta Conference, the Allied powers decided that
              | only a complete capitulation of all German forces on all fronts would be ac-
              | cepted, and that Germany would be divided into three military occupation
              | zones (at that time, France was not yet recognized as one of the World War
              | victors). This was seen as the final blow to the Nazis (more so than the formal
              | capitulation of the German military in May 1945) and resulted in a fall of Ger-
              | man bond prices by 34 percent.

              | The bond prices of French government bonds, displayed in Figure 2, indicate a
              | constant value until the middle of 1938, followed by a huge drop, coinciding
              | with the “official” outbreak of War, invasion by German forces, and capitula-
              | tion (June 22, 1940). After trading was resumed at the Swiss bourse, the French
              | bonds experienced a continuous increase in value until the end of 1945. The
              | value of the French government bonds remained above 20 percent of the emis-
              | sion value, even though France suspended interest payments in November
              | 1942, and did not resume servicing its debts until the end of the period consid-
              | ered. The fact that French government bonds did not drop to zero shows rela-
              | tively high confidence on the part of the traders that France would re-emerge as
              | an independent nation, would pay back its debts by the due date and resume
              | paying interest.

              | The econometric estimates identify five statistically significant break points
              | for France (Table 2).
              | French government bond values suffered a blow when the Germans occu-
              | pied the demilitarized Rheinland in May 1936. To some extent, the financial
              | investors may have lost confidence in the ability of the French to successfully
              | oppose the Nazi government’s aggressive policy. The “official” outbreak of
              | World War II at the beginning of September 1939 reduced its bond values still
meta          | 342
text          | further. An even stronger fall in French government bonds occurred when
              | France was defeated and occupied by the Germans in May and June 1940. The
              | invasion of the Allied troops in Normandy in June 1944 was greeted as a deci-
              | sive sign of military and political recovery, and raised French government bond
              | values. The negative break point in January 1946 is not related to any obvious
              | political or military event.

              | 4.3 Denmark
              | Figure 3 shows the spread of the Danish government bond yield over the Swed-
              | ish government bond yield in the Stockholm bond market around 1938 to 1940.
              | While the figures and tables for Germany and France just reported refer to
              | bond prices, the following figures and tables for Denmark (and Norway) refer
              | to bond yields. Bond prices and bond yields are inversely related: while an
              | increase in sovereign risk is reflected by a fall in bond prices, it is reflected by
              | a rise in bond yields. Moreover, the size of breaks is measured by a percent
              | change in bond prices, and by a percentage change in yields. The same change
              | in sovereign risk is thus reflected in a lower figure in the case of bond yields
              | than in the case of bond prices. For example, an improvement in sovereign risk,
              | resulting in a doubling of bond prices (+ 100%), means that the bond yield falls
              | by half, say from 10% to 5%, i.e., a fall of 5 percentage points.
              | Evidently, there were no fears among investors about the repayment of Dan-
              | ish bonds during all of 1938. In March 1939, however, the first sign of distur-
              | bance is indicated by a small, yet significant, structural break point, reported in
              | Table 3. This break is recorded immediately after the German annexation of
              | Czechoslovakia, and can be explained when taking into consideration that
              | Germany and Denmark had geographical and historical ties that resembled
              | those between Germany and Czechoslovakia. The actual outbreak of War in
              | September 1939 did not have much affect on the Danish yield spread, mainly
              | because the Swedish yields (i.e., sovereign risk) also increased at that time.
              | What did matter, disproportionately to the assessed war threat to Denmark,
meta          | 343
text          | however, was the Soviet attack on Finland in late November the same year.
              | The Danish spreads jumped up by a statistically significant 2.1 percentage
              | points in early December 1939, which coincides closely with the outbreak of
              | the Finnish Winter War. In other words, the Swedish contemporaries perceived
              | the aggression against Finland as a bad sign for the future prospects of the
              | Danish government being able (or willing) to service its debt obligations to
              | foreign bondholders. Given the close connection to wartime events, this can
              | then be interpreted as an increased assessed risk of war to Denmark.

meta          | 344
text          | 9, 1940. This break point bears a lot of information when compared to the
              | earlier break points in the Danish series. The reason is that, although the con-
              | temporaries had perceived notable increases in the war threats on Denmark
              | before the German invasion, they did still not fully believe it would happen. If
              | they had, there would never have been any additional spread increase, i.e.,
              | sovereign risk increase, when the war on Denmark eventually broke out. In this
              | way, we can infer the assessed likelihood of a war outbreak in the eyes of the
              | contemporaries during the pre-war era by relating the observed market yields at
              | the time of the outbreak and the pre-war yields (for further details, see Walden-
              | ström and Frey, 2007).
              | 4.4 Norway
              | Figure 4 shows the yield spreads of Norwegian government bonds traded in
              | Stockholm for 1938-1940. Broadly speaking, the evolution of the spreads in
              | Norway in this turbulent era resembles the corresponding evolution in Den-
              | mark. Before the German invasion of Norway on April 9, 1940, the financial
              | markets in Stockholm seem to have perceived a constant build-up of war
              | threats to Norway. Three positive structural breaks indicate this, as reported in
              | Table 4. First, in March 1939, there is a small, but significant increase in the
              | Norwegian spread, which may be related to the German annexation of Czecho-
              | slovakia. Second, there is a larger significant structural break estimated at the
              | end of August 1939, directly after the non-aggression pact between Germany
              | and the Soviet Union (the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) and right before the Ger-
              | man attack on Poland. Third, there is a break dated in late December, which
              | coincides in time with recent war activities between Finland and the Soviet
              | Union. In other words, financial markets clearly perceived an increased war
              | threat to Norway well ahead of the actual war outbreak in 1940.
              | However, the Norwegian yield spreads in Stockholm also contain two sig-
              | nificant structural breaks in 1940. The first shows a large positive break, i.e.,
              | signaling an increased risk of a Norwegian sovereign default, dated late April
              | 1940. This break is clearly associated with the German invasion of that month.
              | Notably, as in the case of Denmark, this break suggests that the contemporaries
              | were not convinced that Norway would eventually be involved in the War,
              | because that would have implied that yield spreads should not have changed
              | significantly in response to the invasion. A fifth and final break is dated August
              | 1940. The exact date of this break is uncertain due to the volatile bond prices of
              | Norwegian bonds after the German invasion (most likely due to low levels of
              | trading). Still, it coincides with the surrender of the Norwegian military resis-
              | tance to the invaders, and interestingly it seems as if the bond market actors
              | interpreted this major blow to the Norwegian sovereignty as positive for the
              | likelihood of their bonds being serviced by the Norwegian government.

              | The above sections present the empirical results of the financial market ap-
              | proach to analyzing history. Several interesting findings are revealed. Some of
              | the events that are generally thought to be crucial are clearly reflected in the
              | German and French government bond prices. This holds, in particular, for the

              | official outbreak of the war from July to September 1939. It markedly reduced
              | the government bond values of Germany (by 39 percent) and France (by 25
              | percent). The same holds for losses and gains of national sovereignty. When
              | Belgium and France were defeated and occupied by German forces in the Blitz-
              | krieg of May 1940, the German government bond values rose by 8 percent and
              | those of France fell by no less than 31 percent. The same holds in the case of
              | the two Nordic countries analyzed, Denmark and Norway. The German inva-
              | sion in April 1940 was clearly noticeable on the bond market, with sharp in-
              | creases in the perceived risk of a sovereign default, according to falls in the
              | countries’ bonds.
              | At the same time, we also note that certain events to which historians attach
              | great importance are not reflected in bond prices at all: the most prominent
              | example is the capitulation of the Wehrmacht in May 1945, which is neither
              | reflected in the German nor French government bond prices. The Allied inva-
              | sion in Normandy in June 1944 raised the French bond values (by 16 percent)
              | but did not lead to a break in the values for Germany. In the case of Denmark,
              | the non-aggression pact between Germany and Denmark at the end of May
              | 1939 did not influence the bond market’s perception concerning war risks on
              | Denmark at all.
              | Finally, the results indicate situations where the claims of historians may
              | even be questioned by the financial market evidence. For example, Nordic
              | historians have regularly argued that the contemporaries in the Nordic countries
              | did not perceive any increased risk of war to their own countries in the period
              | before the war, i.e., in 1939 and early 1940.9 By contrast, the estimated struc-
              | tural breaks for both Denmark and Norway clearly indicate that the sovereign
              | risk of these countries increased significantly in connection with war-related
              | geopolitical events, and could be clearly interpreted as increasing the military
              | threat against these countries.
              | 6. Comparison
              | The above discussion reveals that the traditional historiography and the finan-
              | cial market method approach history from very different points of view. De-
              | spite this fundamental difference, the two approaches share the fact that they
              | both rely on interpretation – but what must be interpreted differs considerably.
              | Standard historical research has to interpret the reliability and meaning of
              | the documents studied and interviews with the decision makers at that time.
              | Historians are trained to do this very carefully in order to understand what was

meta          | 347
text          | thought at the time and not confound the situation with information available
              | only after the fact. This is sometimes extremely difficult, if not impossible. For
              | instance, today’s historians must seek to understand why the Nazi government
              | engaged in war, even knowing that they would lose.
              | The financial market approach is based on data only containing the know-
              | ledge available at the respective time; subsequent time only enters into the
              | equation through the expectations of the market participants, again at the re-
              | spective time. The financial market approach is not faced with the problems of
              | standard historical approach, but has other major problems of interpretation. In
              | addition to the problems common to econometric estimations, the most impor-
              | tant ones are:
              | - Why are some of the break points identified not related to any major
              | political or historical event (such as the negative break point in January
              | 1946 for French government bonds)?
              | - Why are some important historical facts not visible as break points
              | (such as the capitulation of the Wehrmacht in May 1945)?
              | A handy explanation refers to the notion that financial market values do not
              | show any reactions or breaks if the traders already took the respective historical
              | events into account, i.e. if they are already “priced in”. This may, for example,
              | be argued for the German capitulation, which was imminent, and which traders
              | saw coming some considerable time before May 1945. Such an explanation
              | makes sense, but it is somewhat ad hoc. The same could be said of other
              | events, such as, for example, the invasion of Normandy. It has still not been
              | explained why this event (positively) affected the value of the French govern-
              | ment bonds only, but did not affect the value of the German bonds.
              | Another issue of interpretation is due to the government bond market captur-
              | ing the expectations of a special group of people active in these markets. These
              | are not only the actual traders working on these financial markets. The group
              | involved comprises a much larger group of actors influencing the supply and
              | demand of these assets. It is not known who the buyers and sellers on the gov-
              | ernment bond market were during the period in question. It may well be, of
              | course, that these actors differed substantially from the political and military
              | decision makers, who were responsible for war activity. The approach may
              | allow us to identify not only the motivations of persons interested in financial
              | prosperity, and hence presumably the economic prosperity of a country, but
              | also the motivations of politicians and the military, which might have more
              | narrow interests and might be subject to over-optimism and hubris.
              | 7. Conclusion
              | The two approaches to analyzing history discussed here – the standard histo-
              | riographic approach and the financial market approach – each have their spe-
meta          | 348
text          | cific strengths and weaknesses. Without doubt, a careful study of documents
              | and interviews with the decision makers at the time can reveal important in-
              | sights. In many cases, it is the only feasible and reasonable method. In the case
              | of the Nazi rise to power and the Second World War, it is indispensable to
              | consider what was written and said at the time by the political and military
              | decision makers. Still, when it comes to representing widely held pre-war
              | threat assessments, an in-depth interpretation of a few written sources is hardly
              | sufficient for capturing the views and opinions of the public at the time.
              | The financial market approach presented here may, in such cases, be a use-
              | ful, and perhaps, so far, underutilized, complementary method, offering addi-
              | tional insights. For example, it was found that some of the conventional histo-
              | riography concerning the widely held pre-war threat assessments in the Nordic
              | countries disagrees with the estimates of the corresponding threat assessments
              | according to the contemporary financial markets. But this approach also suffers
              | from potential methodological problems with, e.g., the econometric methods
              | used, which rely on choices and assumptions that are questionable. Therefore,
              | the two approaches should not be seen as exclusive of each other, but rather as
              | helping us to see specific aspects of history more clearly and in a different
              | light.
