              | Abstract
              | After the accession to the European Union in 2004 and 2007, political actors of
              | new member states are equally represented in all EU institutions. In addition to the
              | political level, a huge body of medium to high-level administrative staff and
              | lobbyists has moved to this specific European labour market. After a phase of
              | asymmetrical power constellations during the accession process, how can, after
              | 2004, the real participation in the policy-making process in the enlarged EU of 25
              | Member States (EU-25) be characterized? How do participants of Central and
              | East European Member States (EU-8) act in the new surrounding, given that all
              | EU-institutions themselves are much more heterogeneous and in a process of
              | consolidation and adjustment? Given that newcomers could not yet fully exploit the
              | possibilities of negotiations in the policy-making process and their style of
              | lobbying, negotiating and bargaining still is in need of a necessary fine-tuning, the
              | aim of this paper is to highlight constellations in the field of EU cohesion policy, in
              | which actors of this Brussels scene were - although regarded as a peripheral
              | group - able through formal and informal exchange of knowledge to act as
              | promoters of the elaborated EU-inspired thinking and socio-economic positioning.
              | Factors influencing the arena of negotiations are, firstly, whether participants are -
              | at a societal-cultural level - able to react in an adequate manner. This personal
              | disposition is based on working experience and the study background, thus the
              | level of socialisation in an international and European-oriented context. The
              | second vector of influence is based on the national background and on domestic
              | politics: Which is the room of manoeuvre for participants to act as promoter or
              | transmitter?
              | The analysis of this potential for mobilization is based on expert interviews with
              | MEP, EU officials and lobbyists of new member states carried through in spring
              | and autumn of 2007 in Brussels.

text          | Introduction
              | When you know how the EU machinery is working, then the process of policy-
              | making increasingly becomes a creative process.
              | After the accession to the European Union in 2004 and 2007, political actors of
              | former communist countries are equally represented in all EU institutions. In
              | addition to the political level, a huge body of medium to high-level administrative
              | staff and lobbyists has moved to this specific European labour market. While
              | working as politicians, officials or lobbyists in the institutional structures of the EU,
              | these actors get in dept acquainted with the Brussels style of working and the
              | elaborated code of negotiation. At the same time, these experts maintain a
              | frequent and regular exchange with actors on the national level, thus forming a
              | specific “Brussels scene”.
              | Since the beginning of accession negotiations at the end of the 1990s, all
              | categories of actors have been familiarized with the Brussels administrative arena
              | and the negotiating style. They were able to gain working experience in EU-related
              | line ministries, organisations and political committees. After a phase of
              | asymmetrical power constellations during the accession process, how can, after
              | 2004, the real participation in the policy-making process in the enlarged EU of 25
              | Member States (EU-25) be characterized? How do the new participants of Central
              | and East European Member States (EU-8)1 act in the new surrounding, given that
              | all EU-institutions themselves are much more heterogeneous and in a process of
              | consolidation and adjustment? The year 2004 thus marked a new and at the same
              | time unique situation for old and new Member States alike2.
              | Starting in 2004, negotiations for the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 with
              | implications for the EU Cohesion Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy
              | (CAP) have been on the agenda for two years. The results as to financial
              | arrangements did not fully meet the expectations of delegations of new Member
              | States. Nevertheless some financially minor, but innovative aspects forwarded by
              | actors of the EU-8 (by single delegations, by the group of EU-8 or by the Visegrád
              | group) were incorporated in the new regulations. So they were partially able to
              | carve out creative niches.
              | In general, these lengthy negotiations were characterized by participants of the
              | new Member States as a “real learning area” and a “healthy ferment”3. This means
              | that inherent difficulties among the “newcomers” as well as misperceptions and
              | non-acceptance among old Member States were part of the game: On the one
              | hand, actors of the EU-8 did not yet possess of refined negotiation capacities and
              | capabilities which include an openness to cooperate with different partners and to
              | have a feeling for the necessary early mobilization and for active formal and
              | 1 To avoid repetition, the labels Central and Eastern Europe and EU-8 are used interchangeably for
              | the new Member States of the accession round of 2004; the same applies to old Member States
              | and EU-15.
              | 2 This means that the institutional and policy arrangements of the enlarged EU are not yet “locked
              | in” (Goetz 2006: 13) and that the European project is inherently in flux (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004:
              | 23).

text          | informal modes of participation. In addition, the demonstration of a sometimes too
              | strong self-confidence and self-assertion of outstanding actors of Central and East
              | European Member States could be mentioned: The Polish delegation is blamed for
              | an aggressive way of negotiating and of demonstrating a very national rhetoric as
              | to the Reform Treaty (Lang 2006; Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 7ff.).
              | On the other hand, the nature of established negotiation structures and codes of
              | conduct among old Member States made it difficult for newcomers to define and
              | find trustworthy partners: in the different EU institutions defenders of the status
              | quo were reluctant to open the structures of long-established “inner circles” based
              | on and built upon long-shared experience to new groups and communities. This
              | has effectively counteracted the smooth integration of newcomers and has
              | complicated the effective participation in existing patterns of decision-making
              | (Langenohl/Westphal 2006: 10). In consequence these factors have largely
              | hindered the emergence of inclusive modes of policy-making within different EU
              | Institutions.
              | Finally, this leads to the perception that even several years after the accession still
              | asymmetrical forms of bargaining and negotiations can be seen and that,
              | indirectly, power differentials among Member States are portrayed4. In addition the
              | perception among EU-8 is that they see themselves as peripheral to their
              | negotiation partners.
              | Now the Mid-term Evaluation of the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 is on top of
              | the agenda of actors of all EU-Institutions. This intergovernmental bargaining
              | process has again implications for the future orientation of financially most
              | significant policy fields such as the Common Agricultural Policy and Cohesion
              | Policy5 as well as for areas such as environment and the enlargement policy.
              | Therefore, the capacity for a clever and early positioning in these contexts has a
              | high relevance for the socio-economic context of Central and Eastern European
              | Member States of the EU.
              | Given that newcomers could not yet fully exploit the possibilities of negotiations in
              | the policy-making process and their style of lobbying, negotiating and bargaining
              | still is in need of a necessary fine-tuning, the aim of this paper is to highlight
              | constellations, in which actors of this Brussels scene were - although regarded as
              | a peripheral group - able through formal and informal exchange of knowledge to
              | act as promoters of the elaborated EU-inspired thinking and socio-economic
              | positioning. The analysis of this potential for mobilization is based on expert
              | interviews with Polish (and Hungarian) lobbyists, EU officials and Members of the
              | European Parliament (MEPs) carried through in spring and autumn of 2007 in
              | 4 These structural mismatches are among other things expressed by hard facts such as by
              | grouping newcomers differently with regard to official charts and statistics: In the context of the
              | ECOFIN-Council there exist stability and convergence programmes for EU-15 (I) and EU-12 (II).
              | This means that the 12 new Member States are dealt with in “stability and convergence
              | programmes II”, although some of them are already part of the Euro zone (homepage of Council of
              | Ministers, 7 March 2008).
              | 5 The launch of the Fourth Cohesion Report in autumn of 2007 marked the starting point for a
              | European-wide debate. At the same time, the national and regional absorption capacities of
              | funding frame the possibility for financially important follow-up programmes.

text          | Brussels. The empirical analysis focus the EU cohesion policy due to its cross-
              | sector potential: This means that cohesion policy involves environmental aspects,
              | enlargement and energy policy as well as the second pillar of CAP, the rural
              | development.
              | Factors influencing the actual arena of negotiations are, firstly, whether
              | participants are - at a societal-cultural level - able to react in an adequate manner.
              | This personal disposition is based on working experience and the study
              | background, thus the level of socialisation in an international and European-
              | oriented context. To what extend does the new generation of staff already
              | represent modern diplomats for Europe? The second vector of influence is based
              | on the national background and on domestic politics: Which is the room of
              | manoeuvre for participants to act as promoter or transmitter? In other words, when
              | it comes to the contextualisation of actors’ behaviour the level of independence is
              | important: To which degree are persons involved able to speak in the name of the
              | EU-Institution and thus to transmit the philosophy of the relevant EU institution6?
              | To what extent does a general consensus among elites (and the public) exist that
              | EU membership is beneficial in the long run? To combine the factors: What kind of
              | coalitions are actors of the Brussels scene willing (personally) and able (externally
              | dominated or influenced) to form? These questions are coupled with the
              | necessary acceptance of the open-endedness of decision-making and the fact that
              | benefits are long-termed and somewhat abstract (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004).
              | The expected outcome is the application of refined negotiation capacities which
              | include an openness for mutual dialogue and the ability to create incentives for a
              | consensual behaviour (in order to form coalitions), while being flexible and
              | dynamic. Thus a feeling for different, soft steering methods is needed, while
              | “having fun” to convince and to persuade. In addition, the willingness and ability to
              | argue out of the philosophy of the relevant EU institution is needed and part of the
              | game. In the context of transferring normative aspects, the capacity of actors to
              | easily intertwin policy fields and topics in a clever way is requested. In the field of
              | EU Cohesion Policy the willingness to promote instruments related to the Lisbon
              | Strategy is necessary. By using soft diplomacy, the EU personnel is able to multi-
              | varietly adopt to the situation, to grasp the opportunities and finally to carve out
              | creative niches. Thereby, an increasingly European-oriented motivation of
              | promoters is manifesting both horizontally (among EU institutions) as well as in
              | vertical administrative contexts.
              | Conceptual lenses
              | Discussions in political science and sociology focus the consolidation phase of the
              | transformation process in combination with Europeanization or EU-ization
              | (Langenohl/Westphal 2007; Kutter/Trappmann 2006). These debates are also
              | applicable for the work in the new institutional structures of the European Union. In
              | addition, multi-level governance is the new game in town, which entails formal and
              | informal lobbying and negotiation mechanisms as well as soft forms of steering.
              | Actual fields of applications are the Lisbon Strategy including concepts such as the
              | 6 Normative aspects e.g. of the EU Cohesion policy are embedded in the philosophy of EU
              | institutions and find expression in drafts and reports of cohesion policy’s regulations.

              | governance (Marshall 2005).
              | Sociological approaches refer to the notion of “tacit knowledge”, which goes back
              | to the work of Polanyi (1985): a “canon of knowledge” is forming an integral part of
              | the individual and social life. This canon not only entails explicit forms of
              | knowledge to be learnt, but also deep-rooted and prevailing forms of implicit
              | knowledge. This knowledge has the function to be an essential cultural frame in
              | the context of daily working and acting.
              | “It is not only instrumental in helping finding one’s way through the labyrinth of
              | modern, differentiated and pluralized societies, but also implies understandings of a
              | certain moral order that cannot be reduced to its functionality in steering social
              | practices. Usually the implied reference of the pursuing of social practices to social
              | imaginaries and their normative taint goes without saying. Under conditions of societal
              | transformation, however, practices become transparent as to their moral references,
              | and thus questionable and criticisable on the grounds of their normative
              | embeddedness and their moral implications” (Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 9).
              | With regard to normative socio-economic aspects underlying European policy
              | fields, the relevant philosophy of EU institutions towards that policy field has been
              | formed over a long period of time. It finds expression in the policy content as well
              | as in the promotion of certain procedures, by which the policy is carried through.
              | Nevertheless these underlying norms and rules are a dynamic explanans; they are
              | thus susceptible to processes of adaptations and changes over time.
              | Moreover, the relevant codes of communication and codes of bargaining,
              | applicable in the daily administrative and political work as well as in the internal
              | decision-making processes of EU institutions, have been internalized by the EU
              | personnel, the national delegations, the lobbyists and the MEPs, respectively7.
              | The enlargement of the European Union entails a kind of societal transformation
              | within EU institutions: While internal and external rules of the game become
              | transparent, this implicit knowledge has to be incorporated and habitualized by
              | members of the group of EU-8. While the foundation of this knowledge is a
              | dynamic one that allows for continuity as well as for changes, this special
              | transformation phase might entail a recomposition or a reconfiguration of
              | formalized knowledge and of principle frameworks8 to be applicable in the
              | enlarged EU of now 27 Member States. The circulation of ideas and values as well
              | as the application of new strategies and innovative approaches can be described
              | as cognitive Europeanization, in which personal and institutionalized aspects are
              | interwoven (Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 2). In general, concepts with reference to
              | “implicit knowledge”, social capital or “common sense” enable to put an academic
              | gloss on insights of social practice that seem obvious, and at other times yield
              | surprising results.
              | 7 Implicit knowledge can be realized inter-subjectively by socialization. Thereby, knowledge either
              | retains its implicit form or it will be externalized, and thus transformed into explicit knowledge. This
              | happens through the process of articulation and codification.
              | 8 While the knowledge is subject to different traditions, it is changeable and flexible through daily
              | action and experience. In the long run, also rules of institutions are considered as being permeable
              | and are thus considered to be possibly reconstructed.

text          | The actual dilemmas and difficulties of the societies of new Member States in the
              | phase of consolidation are conceptually underpinned by political culture, cultural
              | legacies, traditions of election and euro-scepticism (Taggert/Szcerbiak 2004) as
              | well as by aspects of collective identity (Ademczyk/Gostmann 2007).
              | Vectors of Influence
              | The first factors influencing the degree of socialization and embeddedness in the
              | internal negotiation structures of relevant EU institution as well as the frames of
              | perception, are skills and training of actors of the EU-8: The highly skilled staff of
              | the Brussels scene might have benefited from traineeships or preparatory
              | administrative programmes such as Twinning9, the observer status in EU
              | institutions such as the Committee of Regions and the European Parliament. This
              | has enabled the participants of the Candidate States to already getting a feeling
              | for the setting and the internal (explicit and implicit) rules of each institution.
              | Moreover, in the field of training and education actors might have participated in
              | European-focused study programmes and language courses before the accession
              | in 2004. Through multi-lingual interdisciplinary education and training there is an
              | indirectly growing elite consensus over Europe: “One has to bear in mind that
              | throughout the region there is a relatively high degree of consensus among
              | (political) elites about the positive nature of European integration”
              | (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004: 3). While the quality of human capital in the European-
              | centred administration is improving, a re-formation or a refining of knowledge
              | takes place: The capacity of this elite-circle enables for a differentiated EU-
              | focused thinking within line ministries and back-offices to support the Brussels
              | actors in a qualified way.
              | From the perspective of new East and Central European Member States the year
              | of accession 2004 marked a rapid and dense flow of EU-focused expertise to the
              | Brussels arena. At the same time it is clear that a great number of EU
              | administrative staff is allotted from national line ministries for a period of three to
              | five years. Within the group of EU-8 the potential to nominate high-qualified EU
              | personnel from line ministries and from political parties for posts in the Brussels
              | scene varies. A characteristic of these newly formed networks is that they are
              | composed of relatively young, dynamic and flexible professionals. This means that
              | they are likely to regard the period of election, delegation or allotment in the
              | Brussels arena as a further step of underlying carrier opportunities in the national
              | context.
              | With respect to Cohesion Policy the Polish side was able to send and to nominate
              | (much more intensively than e.g. the Hungarian side) experts in the field of
              | regionalisation and strong advocates of an integrated regional policy: They
              | possess technical and administrative expertise and they are personalities with a
              | European mission (personal expertise). Consequently, they were allotted high
              | ranking posts such as Commissioner for Regional Policy within the European
              | Commission or (Vice-)Chairmen of Committees in the European Parliament such

              | staff of old and new Member States which proofed valuable might be continued on a regular basis.

              | high-ranking posts within the national administration and the political scene
              | respectively10. While they are using the Brussels experience to shape their
              | respective home career, they are supposed to have strong connections to the
              | national part of the Brussels scene.
              | The second factor refers to the political background in East and Central European
              | Member States to allow for a relative independence and support which also
              | implies a close, trustworthy and open correspondence with national actors of the
              | Brussels scene. That means that there must be congruence between the content
              | of European-inspired thinking and the national elite’s positioning on the
              | transnational European integration process. Moreover, optimal chains of
              | communication to transfer the European-inspired knowledge adequately have to
              | be guaranteed.
              | This European-inspired thinking affects questions of economic redistribution,
              | welfare and governmental regulation of the economy. These modes of distribution
              | are combined with several non-economic issues such as ecologist, gender and
              | lifestyle (Marks et al 2006: 157). In other words this implies norms and rules set by
              | EU institutions to handle e.g. EU Cohesion Policy and the European employment
              | policy, thus the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, and cross-sections such as
              | the urban dimension, innovation policy, environmental protection, sustainable
              | growth and even enlargement and energy policy. These consolidated ideals of
              | Western civilization also affect procedural aspects such as participatory decision-
              | making. In this logic e.g. the European Parliament is the embodiment of issues
              | such as regionalization, culture, support of cultural and linguistic diversity as well
              | as social and territorial cohesion, which is now even codified in the Treaty of
              | Lisbon.
              | Given the political and economic transnationalization, which European integration
              | implies, it has to be reflected that the state is still a central agent and a centre
              | stage for transnational processes as well as a vehicle for transnational
              | democratization (Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 8ff.). Moreover, it is important to
              | understand the domestic context of party competition in order to gain a full picture
              | of the context for national elite positions on European integration
              | (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004: 17f.). In other words, parties can be considered as
              | gatekeepers for European interaction: European argumentation is closely related
              | to positions in their party systems (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004: 2). Consequently,
              | actors of the Brussels scene are through direct or indirect party affinity embedded
              | in different frames of political thinking, which implies understandings of a certain
              | moral order and based on different regulatory ideas as to wealth distribution within
              | a given society (Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 8). Actors have thus to adequately
              | articulate political-societal projects to react to developments such as fragmenting,

              | mentioned. While from from 2004 onwards, e.g. the latter has been (Vice-) Chairman of the
              | Committee for External Affairs, he used to be Minister for European Affairs 1991-1996 and 2000-
              | 2001 and Counceller for the Prime Minister for questions relating to European Integration. In

              | that it is easier for actors of oppositional parties to support pro-European views
              | and of having an increased interest to demonstrate leadership
              | (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004). The capacity for strategic thinking and the addressee-
              | orientation among politicians and administrative staff of the Brussels scene also
              | depends on the frequency of governmental changes: Political changes might be
              | coupled with a shuffling of personnel and thematic reorientations as well as with
              | necessary changing loyalties11.
              | As to the second factor it can be stated that Polish political activists for regional
              | policy of the Brussels scene are predominately pro-market libertarian oriented.
              | This means that their party affiliation allows them - as concerns EU issues - to
              | support so-called new politics dimensions such as environment and participatory
              | decision-making (Henderson 2001: 10 in Marks et al 2006: 168). While parties
              | aiming at a pro-market libertarian orientation were in opposition since the Polish
              | parliamentary elections of 2005 e.g. MEPs belonging to the PO were still in a
              | position to argue more quality than quantity-oriented, together with a view on side-
              | policy fields: Given that opposition party members were nationally not directly
              | responsible for the negotiation outcomes of the Councils of Ministers, they have
              | had the freedom to think in different categories and to carve out creative niches
              | while articulating political-societal projects. In this logic they could use the moral
              | embeddedness and integrational power of the relevant EU institution (and the
              | party family) for their transnational argumentation, while demonstrating an
              | openness for different regulatory ideas and an abandoning of nationally embedded
              | practices of norm- and rule-setting. This tendency is supported by the Polish
              | personnel of EU institutions such as the European Commission and the Council of
              | Ministers, which has been selected through big parties already in 2004.
              | The negotiation potential of actors of the New Member States
              | In the empirical part three examples are highlighted to illuminate the power of the
              | alleged peripheral group of EU-8. That means that the management of structural
              | mismatches might be beneficial for the so called outsiders. This inferior position
              | enables actors of this inner circle vis-à-vis their negotiation partners to
              | - be taken as an example because they have an openness for new thematic
              | fields (e.g. eco-tourism in the field of agriculture);
              | - introduce or suggest new and creative ways of thinking;
              | - have the “right” to act in a contra-factual way, which might at first sight
              | suggest a naïve way of behaving.
              | Due to the similar authoritarian legacy, the commonly shared accession process,
              | thus the experience of “Europeanization from scratch” there is less diversity and
              | more bunching among the EU-8. Seen from the socio-economic angle, the group
              | of EU-8 formed net recipients with high expectations as to the volume and the
              | intensity of structural funds and CAP allowances. Within this new embeddedness,
              | some communities or clusters might again take the leadership: This might be true
              | for the Polish delegation due to the size of the delegation and the respective

              | Based on the advantage of a small number of interlocuters, already in 2004,
              | Working Groups among officials from the Permanent Representations of Member
              | States in Brussels were formed. To compensate for uncertainties regular, weekly
              | meetings and exchanges of additional information were organized on the basis of
              | the EU-8.
              | To gain an insight into the potential of the EU-8, three examples are highlighted in
              | the following. These small case studies are based on increasingly popular themes.
              | New legal instrument: European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation (EGTC)
              | The main input for the introduction of this framework legal instrument and thus the
              | upgrade of the goal of territorial cohesion stems from the European Parliament in
              | close cooperation with the DG Regio of the European Commission. The underlying
              | assumption, which reflects the philosophy of the European Parliament, is to
              | incorporate the territorial dimension into Community policies, given the real impact
              | of sectoral policies – such as transport, environment, competition and research
              | policy – on the territory of the European Union. The initial draft, which included a
              | thematically broad arrangement and combined interregional, intraregional and
              | transnational dimensions was strongly supported by the Polish rapporteur,
              | nominated by the Committee on Regional Development in the EP, Mr Jan Olbrycht
              | (PO). The former president of Upper Silesia is a strong advocate for a far-reaching
              | regionalization. It is remarkable that - in the context of EU cohesion policy - he was
              | the only politician out of MEPs of the EU-8 to be nominated as rapporteur for a
              | draft regulation under the procedure of co-decision. Moreover, as a member of the
              | European People’s Party he has the standing and the openness to bargain with
              | other national delegations and to closely co-operate with other EU-institutions. In
              | this context, he could benefit from close and long-lasting personal contacts with
              | the Commissioner Mrs Danuta Hübner and with the Committee of the Regions
              | (CoR)12. Although the draft first met with resistance from various old Member
              | States based on a fear of loss of national sovereignty and of a too strong local or
              | regional level, finally the Council’s Common Position supported key elements of
              | the initial draft to manage cross-border projects more effectively. In addition, an
              | institutionalized integration of the CoR on the procedural side could be initiated for
              | the first time: This indirect instrumentalization of the CoR throws new lines into the
              | division of work of EU institutions and is an example of an – up to date – unusual
              | inter-institutional cooperation.
              | It has to be admitted that the introduction of this legal instrument was possible also
              | due to its relatively cost-free stance. When it comes to the application, regionally
              | elected Polish MEPs such as Mr. Mieczyslaw Edmund Janowski (PO) were again
              | strong advocates for the introduction of diverse cross-border projects in the
              | 12 As a member of the board on the Association of European Regions and his former activities for
              | the regionalization of Poland during the 1990s Mr. Olbrycht is already well-recognized in the
              | Brussels scene and known as a smooth cooperation partner. Expert interview with a representative

              | the group of EU-8 might benefit from additional money from the title for External
              | Policy for the support of cross-border projects along EU’s external borders. This
              | means that although the Polish delegation was said to play the nationalistic card
              | (as to the Reform Treaty), the enthusiastic advocacy for the introduction of the
              | EGTC underlines a liberal stance.
              | To sum up, the notion of territorial cohesion not only respects the principle of the
              | Lisbon Strategy by strengthening the cluster and network approach together with a
              | focus on the urban dimension, but it is now also fixed in the Lisbon Treaty.
              | Policy framing through the introduction of Housing
              | The second example scrutinizes the policy-making process for the introduction of
              | a new theme within the financially most important goal convergence. With regard
              | to policy framing the stress on the theme of housing underlines the importance of
              | the urban dimension and could be interpreted as a contribution to discussions of
              | the newly launched energy efficiency debate and the energy productivity
              | discussion. In addition, it implied aspects of social inclusion, thus another principle
              | underlying the European project.
              | Based on the family of nation’s argument the introduction of this theme has been
              | promoted by representatives of former Visegrád countries13: Based on shared
              | problems with the conversion of unused industrial buildings, beneficiaries should
              | be exclusively new Member States. The final introduction of this policy strand in
              | the General Provision of EU cohesion policy in mid-2006 was remarkable, since
              | the financing of housing aspects happens for the first time ever. In general, it
              | follows the actual European-wide tendency that the urban dimension is
              | strengthened by a separate Communication of the European Commission in
              | autumn of 2006. In addition, energy efficiency aspects have become increasingly
              | important during the last years, reflected in the agenda of the Summit of G-8. In
              | sum, the group of EU-8 has proved to be forerunners and has carved out a
              | creative niche.
              | New modes of governance: the politics of new financial instruments
              | The third example reflects the introduction of new financial instruments and the
              | application of new procedures. The underlying assumption is that a set of new
              | instruments is used as a vehicle to support the goals of the updated Lisbon
              | Strategy of 2005: The main aim is to ensure an integrated approach to the
              | enhancement of competitiveness and growth in Europe which includes active
              | labour market instruments such as training and retraining, but also focus the urban
              | dimension, innovation policy, energy policy as well as rural development.
              | In the negotiation phase actors of the group of EU-8 showed an affinity for the
              | introduction and the application of new financial instruments such as Jaspers,
              | Jeremie and Jessica. As to e.g. Jeremie the application of Public Private

text          | the business environment and to promote employment growth among small and
              | medium-sized enterprises (SME). Priority projects might focus the creation of the
              | knowledge-based (innovative) economy, the improvement of access to capital of
              | the SME sector and the development of industrial and logistics parks.
              | In practice, the stress on this dimension was beneficial for the five socio-
              | economically poorest regions in Poland. At the end of the financial negotiations in
              | mid-2006, additional money is granted to five vojevodships with the obligation to
              | stress and to support the innovation capacity. At the same time, the notion of
              | public private partnership refers to a process-orientation with the involvement and
              | commitments of local partners. These arrangements include alliances of
              | knowledge between universities and enterprises and thus narrow nationally
              | embedded practices of norms and rule-setting.
              | In the context of lobbying for a regionally based innovation-orientation the strong
              | input from the Polish MEP Mr Mieczyslaw Edmund Janowski14 (PO) should be
              | mentioned. He is the author of an Initiative Report on „the contribution of the future
              | regional policy to the innovative capacity of the EU”, adopted in the spring of 2007.
              | During the redaction of the report he has closely cooperated with a Dutch MEP of
              | the same political fraction, sharing the affinity of the principle of “open innovation”.
              | Moreover, Mr Janowski is a regionally based advocate for the necessary
              | information campaign as to the broad application of instruments such as Jeremie
              | and Jaspers. In consequence, Poland was among the first to open a liaison office
              | in Warsaw in 2007 for Jaspers: While showing a great amount of goodwill, the
              | Polish authorities’ part of the Brussels scene are regarded as forerunners.
              | Moreover, based on the Twinning experience, regular networking conferences
              | focusing the innovation capacity are organized with Dutch partners. While
              | bilaterally exchanging experience, promoting increased cooperation and improving
              | the coordination between relevant actors at all levels, the potential for best
              | practice under the Open Method of Coordination is used.
              | These newly launched instruments can be financially more or less ignored.
              | Nevertheless, they are quality-oriented and they might thus entail long-lasting,
              | wide-spread effects on the procedural side. It can be stated that the Polish MEPs
              | were able to benefit from the vectors of opportunity based on the internal
              | philosophy of the European Parliament. Moreover, possessing of the necessary
              | political background, they were able to fulfil their role as transmitter of the
              | European-inspired approach as to the innovation and cross-border orientation into
              | the national and regional socio-economic contexts.
              | Conclusions
              | The aim of this paper was to nuance the understanding of bargaining from the
              | perspective of newcomers. This paper has provided a preliminary mapping of
              | negotiation tactics and strategies of actors of the EU-8. In presenting three case
              | studies it has become clear that there exists a potential for successful
              | negotiations, which yielded surprising results on the policy, politics and even polity

              | the semi-optimal integration as an instrument to reinforce their negotiation
              | possibilities. The newcomers were thus able to positively “play the card of
              | underdogs”.
              | It remains an open question whether participants now better know how to cope
              | with the knowledge of increased - by definition multilateral - possibilities of
              | negotiations in the concert of now 27 Member States, while being alert to the
              | Reform Treaty as a future basis of conduct. Are actors of the EU-8 now fully
              | incorporated into the internal structures of supranational institutions of the EU? In
              | addition, it remains to be seen, whether regional formations or clusterings such as
              | the Visegrád Group will pertain as new inner circles, based on smooth cooperation
              | during the last years.
              | In a medium term perspective actors of the EU-8, which are socialized and
              | embedded in the internal structures, might increasingly be able to argue out of the
              | corpus of the respective EU institution. This dynamic and somewhat transformed
              | knowledge might be incorporated in the working agenda or the philosophy of a
              | department of the European Institution or in the work of the national context of the
              | Brussels scene.
