              | Consumer Surplus vs. Welfare Standard in a Political Economy Model of Merger
              | Control
              | by Damien J. Neven and Lars-Hendrik Röller*
              | This paper considers merger control in a common agency framework where firms and
              | their competitors can influence the antitrust agency and where transparency – while
              | making lobbying less effective – also implies real resource costs. We examine the
              | performance of two alternative standards that can be assigned to the antitrust agency in
              | the presence of these regulatory failures. We find that under a welfare standard,
              | lobbying leads to the clearance of relatively inefficient mergers that decrease welfare
              | (i. e. there is a type II error). By contrast, under a consumer surplus standard, the agency
              | will ban relatively efficient mergers that would increase welfare (i. e. there is a type I
              | error). Lobbying actually reduces the extent to which this occurs, albeit at a cost in
              | terms of real resources. We also find that a consumer surplus standard is more attractive
              | when mergers are large, when increasing the size of a merger greatly enhances industry
              | profits, when there is little transparency, and when co-ordination costs amongst
              | competitors are low.

              | In diesem Beitrag wird die wettbewerbsrechtliche Analyse der Fusionskontrolle mit
              | einem Agency-Ansatz erweitert, in dem Unternehmen die Kartellbehörde beeinflussen
              | können und wo Lobbying Kosten verursacht. Es werden zwei unterschiedliche

              | Unternehmen zur Genehmigung von ineffiziente Fusionen, was zu einem Sinken der
              | Wohlfahrt führt. Andererseits führt das Kriterium der Konsumentenrente zur
              | Untersagung von verhältnismäßig effiziente Fusionen, was die Wohlfahrt ebenfalls
              | reduziert. Daraus ergibt sich, daß eine Berücksichtigung der Anreizstrukturen der
              | Unternehmen die Wettbewerbsbehörde zu beeinflussen, wohlfahrttheoretisch keine
              | eindeutige Betrachtungsweise zuläßt. In diesem Sinne zeigt sich, daß das Kriterium der
              | Konsumentenrente vorteilhafter ist, bei Mega-Fusionen, wenn Fusionen sehr profitable
              | sind, wenn es wenig Transparenz gibt und wenn die Koordinationskosten zwischen den
              | nicht-fusionierenden Unternehmen niedrig sind.

text          | Introduction
              | The purpose of this paper is to evaluate alternative objectives that can be assigned to
              | an antitrust agency in charge of merger control. It is striking that some of the major
              | antitrust agencies actually operate with objectives that diﬀer from welfare maximisa-
              | tion. For instance, Art. 2 of the merger regulation stipulates that the merger task force
              | should be solely concerned about restrictions of competition and that eﬃciency beneÞts
              | should only be taken into account in so far as consumers are not hurt. Hence, it would
              | appear that the merger regulation is concerned about consumer surplus and not aggre-
              | gate welfare. The US antitrust legislation has a similar bias in favour of consumers (see
              | e.g. Gellhorn and Kovacic, 1994).
              | In a world with no regulatory failures, excluding Þrms proÞts from the objectives
              | assigned to the antitrust authority would seem hard to justify on eﬃciency grounds.
              | However, in the presence of regulatory failures a systematic bias in favour of a particular
              | interest may occur. In this context, it may be desirable for the public authority (the
              | ultimate principal) to manipulate the objective function of the antitrust agency so as
              | to compensate for the bias ex ante. For instance, an explicit emphasis on consumer
              | surplus, possibly a full truncation of the objective of the antitrust agency so that proÞts
              | are ignored, may be appropriate. That is, decisions taken according to a consumer
              | surplus standard may actually lead to higher welfare than those taken according to a
              | welfare standard.
              | This paper considers the regulatory failures associated with the inßuences that can
              | be brought to bear on an antitrust agency in charge of merger control1. We consider
              | a common agency framework (à la Bernheim and Whinston, 1986) in which interested
              | parties can provide inducements to the antitrust agency which are contingent on the
              | outcome of the merger review. We characterise the contingent perks that Þrms will
              | provide and the decisions that will be taken by the antitrust agency for a distribution of
              | possible mergers and for alternative objectives that can be assigned to the agency. We
              | then compare the advantages and drawbacks of alternative objectives.
              | In particular, we consider a model with four stages. In the Þrst stage, the government
              | decides on the objective that it will assign to the antitrust agency. We focus on two
              | alternative objectives, namely welfare and consumer surplus2.
              | 1Besanko and Spulber (1993) consider a model where regulatory failures arise from asymmetric
              | information regarding the characteristics of the merger, known by the merging Þrms but not the antitrust
              | agency. They also evaluate alternative objective functions that the government might assign to the
              | antitrust agency. They Þnd that the optimal rule should give more weight to consumer surplus than
              | proÞts.
              | 2We focus on these polar cases (rather than consider a continuum of objective functions characterised
meta          | 1
text          | In the second stage, a merger is notiÞed and the interested parties provide contin-
              | gent bids. We consider three interested parties, namely consumers, the merging Þrms
              | and their competitors. However, we assume that consumers are unable to lobby the
              | antitrust agency. This may arise for at least two reasons. First, consumers may not
              | be well informed about the consequences of proposed mergers and accordingly may not
              | be able to formulate appropriate contingent bids. Second, consumers may face pro-
              | hibitive transaction costs in representing their interests. These costs could be associated
              | with the traditional problems of free-riding and collective action with numerous agents.
              | The assumption that consumers are underrepresented in merger review also seems to
              | be broadly consistent with casual observation (for instance, consumer organisations are
              | seldom represented in merger hearings).
              | In the third stage, the antitrust agency (the common agent) decides whether or not
              | to allow the proposed mergers on the basis of its assigned objective and the contingent
              | perks by the interested parties (the principals). In line with the literature on political
              | economy interactions in a common agency framework (see for instance Grossman and
              | Helpman, 1994), we do not explicitly model how the actions of the antitrust agency
              | could be monitored by the government. Rather, we simply assume that the agency
              | is subject to imperfect accountability and can compromise the pursuit of its mission
              | while responding to perks. Unlike the previous literature, we explicitly consider the
              | eﬀect of accountability. In particular, when the agency is accountable, only a fraction
              | of what Þrms spend in lobbying will aﬀect the agencys behaviour, so that with greater
              | accountability the agency will be more diﬃcult to inßuence. Moreover, we assume that
              | the share of Þrms bid which does not aﬀect the agencys behaviour is pure social waste.
              | This assumption is is meant to represent the fact that with greater transparency inßuence
              | has to take indirect routes which are typically less eﬃcient than a direct transfer. For
              | instance, when bribes can be monitored by the government, inßuences will take place
              | through indirect means like expensive lunches or the promise of lucrative jobs in the
              | private sectors (the revolving door). Whereas pure transfers do not entail any eﬃciency
              | losses, indirect means of inßuencing the agency typically involve some real resource cost.
              | Hence, while greater transparency polices the behaviour of the agency, it also involves
              | some real resource costs. We also assume that lobbying by competitors is relatively less
              | eﬃcient than lobbying by merging Þrms simply because competitors are more numerous
              | and hence incur some co-ordination cost. As a result we allow for co-ordination costs
              | amongst competitors that are increasing in the number of competing Þrms.
              | In the Þnal stage, product market competition takes place. In equilibrium, Þrms
              | will thus provide perks anticipating the decision taken by the antitrust agency and the
              | by diﬀerent weights for proÞts) because intermediate cases are presumably hard to implement in practice.

text          | proÞts that will accrue from the outcome of this decision.
              | The proÞts that merging Þrms and their competitors anticipate as a result of any
              | particular merger conÞguration are determined by market interactions before and after
              | the merger. For our purposes, we do not need to specify the market game explicitly,
              | but rather make some general monotonicity assumptions on the reduced form proÞt
              | function of the merging Þrms and their competitors, as well as consumer surplus. In
              | particular, we assume that the proÞts of the merging Þrms, the consumer surplus and
              | welfare increase monotonically with the eﬃciency gains achieved by the merger, while
              | the proÞts of competitors decrease monotonically. These assumptions are reasonable
              | and hold for Cournot with homogenous products. We also assume that larger mergers
              | always enhance industry proÞts but reduce welfare.
              | For both of the agencys objective functions (i.e. welfare and consumer surplus), we
              | characterise the equilibrium and the associated welfare (ex post) for a range of possible
              | mergers characterised by diﬀerent eﬃciency levels. We Þnd that under a welfare standard
              | the agency will allow relatively ineﬃcient mergers that decreases welfare (there is a
              | type II error). In those circumstances, there is also some social waste associated with
              | lobbying by the merging Þrms and their competitors. By contrast, when the agency
              | operates with a consumer surplus standard, it will ban relatively eﬃcient mergers that
              | would increase welfare (there is a type I error). In addition, there is range of mergers
              | which display even higher eﬃciency which are only allowed because of lobbying. In
              | those circumstances, there is some social waste associated with lobbying but no decision
              | error. Overall, lobbying still appears to be desirable under a consumer surplus standard
              | because lobbying re-balances the objective function of the antitrust agency in favour of
              | Þrms. Looking at the relative costs and beneÞts of the alternative standards, we observe
              | that a consumer surplus standard is more attractive when mergers are large, when
              | increasing the size of a merger greatly enhances industry proÞts, and when transparency
              | and co-ordination costs are low.
              | We present the model in Section 2 and derive the equilibrium in Section 3. The
              | comparative statics with respect to the size of the merger and transparency is presented
              | in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.

text          | The model
              | We consider an industry with N Þrms. A merger in this industry is characterised by the
              | number of Þrms involved, M, and by the level of eﬃciency, e, which is achieved by the
              | merged entity. This parameter can be thought of as the reduction of the marginal cost
              | accruing to the merging Þrms.

text          | The structure of the game is illustrated in Figure 1. In stage 1 the government
              | assigns a standard to the antitrust agency. It can choose either a welfare standard or a
              | consumer surplus standard. The objective function of the government is the change in
              | total welfare (proÞts and consumer surplus) less the waste associated with the lobbying
              | process:
              | W = Πm + Πc + CS − (1 − α)Fm − (1 − α + ε(N − M ))Fc
              | (1)
              | where Πm is the change in aggregate proÞts accruing to the merging Þrms, Πc is the
              | change in aggregate proÞts to the competing Þrms, CS is the change in consumer surplus,
              | Fm and Fc are the combined bids of the merging parties and the competing Þrms to
              | the agency, respectively. Note that if the merger is banned, the change in proÞts and
              | consumer surplus is simply zero.
              | We assume that the process of lobbying involves two types of ineﬃciencies. First, a
              | fraction (1 − α) of the bids paid by the merging Þrms and its competitors are wasted.
              | As discussed above, a high share of waste corresponds to an environment with high
              | transparency so that Þrms have to resort to indirect and ineﬃcient means of inßuencing
              | the government. Second, we also assume that lobbying by competitors is relatively less
              | eﬃcient than lobbying by merging Þrms simply because competitors are more numerous
              | and hence incur some co-ordination cost. The waste associated with co-ordination is
              | captured by the term ε(N − M ), where we assume that the co-ordination costs are
              | increasing in the number of competing Þrms3 N − M , i.e. ε0(N − M ) > 0. Let us also
              | denote β = α − ε(N − M ) as the share of the bid paid by the competitors which is pure
              | waste.
              | In stage 2, Þrms provide contingent bids to the agency. The objective function of the
              | Þrms are the changes in their net proÞt, namely the change in their proÞt (as deÞned
              | above) minus the bids that they provide to the agency.
              | In stage 3, the agency decides whether to allow the merger or not. The agency takes
              | into account the standard set by the government and the bids by Þrms. Whenever the
              | agency has been given a welfare standard by the government, its objective functions is
              | given by,
              | U1 = Πm + Πc + CS + αFm + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc
              | (2)
              | 3Note that in this speciÞcation the merging Þrms do not incur any co-ordination costs
meta          | 4
text          | In other words, the agency maximises the sum of the change in welfare associated with
              | the merger and the eﬀective bids (the share of the bid which is not wasted). As discussed
              | above, we assume that consumers cannot lobby.
              | Alternatively, whenever the agency is endowed with a consumer surplus standard,
              | its objective function is given by,

text          | The equilibrium
              | We look for a perfect equilibrium and solve the model by backward induction. Hence,
              | we Þrst consider the equilibrium in stage 4 where Þrms compete.
              | 3.1
              | Product market competition in stage 4.
              | Let Π∗m denote the change in aggregate gross equilibrium proÞts of the merging Þrms
              | and Πc∗ denote the change in aggregate gross equilibrium proÞts of the competitors (that
              | is the proÞts before bids are deducted), if the merger is realised. If the merger is not
              | allowed, gross proÞts are unaﬀected so that the changes in gross proÞts are zero.
              | We do not explicitly specify the market game but assume that the following properties
              | of the proÞt functions as well as consumer surplus hold in equilibrium4:
              | A1: ∂∂Πe∗m > 0, ∂∂Πec∗ < 0, ∂(Π∗m+Πc∗) > 0
              | ∂e
              | A2:
              | ∂∂CeS > 0
              | A3: ∂(Π∗m+Πc∗+CS∗) < 0
              | ∂M
              | A2: ∂(Π∂∗mM+Πc∗) > 0
              | Hence, we assume that the proÞtability of a merger increases with the level of eﬃ-
              | ciency that it can achieve. The proÞts of competitors fall with this level of eﬃciency
              | but the industry proÞt still rises. We also assume that as the eﬃciency gains increase,
              | the equilibrium price falls so that the consumer surplus increases. These assumptions
              | imply that welfare increases in line with the eﬃciency gain. It is straightforward but te-
              | dious to check that these properties actually hold for a Cournot model with homogenous
              | products.
              | 4We also assume that they are continuous and diﬀerentiable.
meta          | 5
text          | The last two assumptions restrict our analysis to situations where larger mergers
              | increase industry proÞts and reduce welfare. These assumptions accord with intuition
              | and should hold for a wide variety of market models.
              | Beyond our maintained assumptions about the proÞt function A1-A4, we further
              | assume that the competitors (whose proÞt fall with eﬃciency) and the consumers (whose
              | surplus increase with eﬃciency) are indiﬀerent for an identical value of the eﬃciency gain
              | denoted by e0. In other words, ∃e0 > 0, s.t. Πc∗(e0) = CS∗(e0) = 0. This property does not
              | appear to be unduly restrictive since it accords with intuition that when the equilibrium
              | price is unaﬀected by the merger, competitors should also be unaﬀected. Again, one can
              | check that this property actually holds for a Cournot model with homogenous products
              | (see Bond, 1994). Finally, we assume the merging parties are rational and restrict
              | attention to the range of eﬃciency parameters which ensure that mergers are proÞtable
              | (i.e. such that Π∗m > 0).
              | The impact that a merger has on the interests of merging Þrms, competitors and
              | consumers under these assumptions is presented graphically in Figure 2, as a function
              | of the eﬃciency achieved by the merger (holding constant the number of Þrms as well as
              | the number of merging Þrms). Note that consumers and the competing Þrms never have
              | congruent interests. When eﬃciency is such that the price increases after the merger,
              | the interests of the merging Þrms and their competitors are aligned. By contrast, when
              | eﬃciency is large enough to guarantee that the price falls, the merging Þrms beneÞt from
              | the mergers and become the allies of consumers, against the interest of competitors.
              | For further reference, it is also useful to deÞne the eﬃciency level which guarantees
              | that the change in total welfare is unaﬀected by the merger. Denote the change in
              | welfare at a given eﬃciency gain by S∼∗(e) = Πc∗(e) + Π∗m(e) + CS∗(e). Note that by
              | ∼
              | A1 and A2 S(e) is increasing in e. DeÞne the eﬃciency level at which total welfare is
              | unchanged by the merger as ∼e such that S∼∗(∼e) = 0 (see also Figure 2).
              | Note that the change in welfare at e is positive, since Πc∗(e0) = CS∗(e0) = 0 and
              | Π∗m(e0) > 0. The last inequality holds, since at an eﬃciency level of e0, price and output
              | are unaﬀected by the merger. Total revenues are thus unaﬀected but total costs fall in
              | line with the eﬃciency gain so that the change in proÞts has to be positive. Furthermore,
              | given the monotonicity of welfare (through A1 and A2) , we also have that ∼e < e0.
              | Our assumptions with respect to the size of the merger (A3 and A4) can also be
              | illustrated in Figure 2. A4 implies that the sum of Þrms proÞts is shifted upwards for
              | larger mergers. By A3, consumer surplus is shifted downwards and the eﬃciency level
              | for which welfare is unaﬀected (∼e) moves to the right.

              | Decisions by the antitrust authority in stage 3
              | In stage 3 the agency decides on the merger. The decision of the authority is either to

              | unessential complexities, we assume that if the agency is indiﬀerent between allowing
              | and prohibiting a merger, it will decide to allow it. The equilibrium at this stage is
              | straightforward: the agency simply compares the levels of utility that it achieves under
              | each outcome and selects the outcome that yields the highest level.
              | Formally, the equilibrium is described as follows. Consider Þrst the welfare standard.
              | In this case, the agencies utility if they allow the merger is given by (2), i.e. U1(D = 1) =
              | Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 1). Similarly, the utility if the
              | agency blocks the merger is given by U1(D = 0) = αFm(D = 0) +(α −ε(N −M ))Fc(D =
              | 0). For the consumer surplus standard, the agencies utility if they allow the merger is
              | given by (3), i.e. U2(D = 1) = CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 1),
              | while the utility if the agency blocks the merger is given by U2(D = 0) = αFm(D =
              | 0) + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 0). Therefore, the decision by the agency is characterized
              | by,
              | 1 if Ui(D = 1) ≥ Ui(D = 0)
              | D = { 0 otherwise }
              | where i = 1, 2 indicates the welfare and consumer standard respectively.

              | Lobbying decisions at Stage 2
              | We derive equilibrium bids for both welfare and consumer surplus standards. Note that
              | the bids are contingent on the actions of the antitrust agency. We therefore need to
              | consider Þrms incentives to bid against and in favor of the merger being allowed. We
              | begin with the welfare standard.
              | 3.3.1
              | Welfare standard
              | Assume that the agency is assigned the welfare standard. In order to solve for the
              | equilibrium bids, it is convenient to distinguish among various parameter regions with
              | respect to the eﬃciency level. As noted above, when e < e0, both the merging Þrms
              | and their competitors beneÞt from the merger and hence will never bid to inßuence the
              | antitrust authority against the merger. We therefore have Fm(D = 0) = Fc(D = 0) = 0.
              | We Þrst consider the Þrms incentives to bid in favor of the merger for regions e ≤ e0.
              | Consider the region where ∼e ≤ e ≤ e0. This is the range of eﬃciency for which mergers
              | do not increase the consumer surplus but do not reduce welfare.
meta          | 7
text          | Lemma 1 Let ∼e ≤ e ≤ e0. Firms will not bid and the merger is allowed.
              | Proof: The agency will allow the merger without any bids, since U1(D = 1) =
              | Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ ≥ U1(D = 0) = 0. Therefore in equilibrium Þrms will not bid. Q.E.D.
              | In this region, the eﬃciency of the merger is such that welfare does not fall. Hence,
              | Þrms do not have to bid in order to inßuence the antitrust agency, which allows the
              | merger without any inducement.
              | Let us now focus on eﬃciency level below ∼e. In this region, the change in welfare is
              | negative and Þrms (which beneÞt from the merger) will have to provide incentive to the
              | agency if they want the merger to be allowed. Given the decision of the agency in stage
              | 3, Þrms will have to ensure that U1(D = 1) ≥ 0. Consider the highest amount that Þrms
              | can bid, i.e. their entire proÞt. The resulting value of the utility of the agency if the
              | merger is allowed is then given by S1∗(e) = Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ + αΠ∗m + (α − ε(N − M ))Πc∗.
              | Let e∗1 be the eﬃciency level such that such that S1∗(e1∗) = 0.
              | Lemma 2 For e < e∗1, Þrms will not bid and the merger is blocked. For e∗1 ≤ e < ∼e,
              | Þrms bid such that U1(D = 1) = 0 and the merger is allowed.
              | Proof : Note that S1∗(e) is monotonically increasing and continuous in e by A1 and
              | A2. Since S1∗(∼e) > 0, we have that e∗1 < ∼e and that e∗1 is unique and it exists (assuming
              | that S1∗(e) < 0 for some possibly negative e). Let e < e∗1 such that S1∗(e) < 0, which
              | implies that U1(D = 1) < 0 for the maximum bids. Therefore, the merger is blocked
              | and it is optimal for Þrms not to bid. Let e∗1 < e < ∼e, which implies that S1∗(e) > 0.
              | Any pair of bids Fm(D = 1), Fc(D = 1) such that U1(D = 1) = 0 is an equilibrium. The
              | merger is allowed. Q.E.D.
              | Hence, whenever eﬃciency is insuﬃcient to guarantee that the merger will increase
              | welfare, Þrms have to provide incentives to the agency in order to have the merger
              | waved through. However, the proÞt of the merging Þrms and its competitors increase
              | in line with the level of eﬃciency. There is thus a range of eﬃciency parameter (below
              | that which guarantees no change in welfare) for which Þrms have suﬃcient proÞt to
              | provide adequate incentives to the antitrust agency. In this region, we consequently
              | have two types of ineﬃciencies, which occur simultaneously. The Þrst one arises because
              | the merger is pushed through by the lobbying activity of Þrms, even though it reduces
              | welfare. We therefore have a type II error. In addition, there is bidding in equilibrium
              | and this entails some waste.
              | It is worth noting at this point that the agency does not obtain any rent from the
              | political economy interactions because Þrms always provide just enough incentives to
              | make the antitrust agency indiﬀerent between allowing and prohibiting the merger. It is
meta          | 8
text          | indeed a standard feature of equilibrium in common agency games that the agent obtains
              | positive rents from the interactions only if the principals have divergent interests (see
              | for instance Grossman and Helpman, 1994).
              | We now consider the region where the incentives of the Þrms are not aligned, i.e.
              | when e is above e0.
              | Lemma 3 For e > e0, the merger is allowed. In equilibrium the merging Þrms bid
              | Fm(D = 1) = max{0, −βΠc∗ − (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗)}.
              | Proof : Given that competitors are hurt by the merger we must have that Fc(D =
              | 1) = 0, which implies that the agency will allow the merger when U1(D = 1) = Π∗m +
              | Πc∗ + CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) ≥ U1(D = 0) = βFc(D = 0). Note that by A1, we have that
              | Π∗m > −Πc∗, which implies that in equilibrium Fm(D = 1) < Π∗m, i.e. the merging Þrms
              | are always able to push the merger through. Assume that Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ < −βΠc∗ so
              | that competitors could have the merger prohibited in the absence of bid by the merging
              | Þrms. Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc∗ −(Π∗m +Πc∗ +CS∗) is then a best reply to Fc(D = 0) = −βΠc∗
              | . Fc(D = 0) = −βΠc∗ is a (weak) best reply to Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc∗ − (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗).
              | In equilibrium, the maximum bid of the competing Þrms is neutralized by the merging
              | Þrms. Next, assume that Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ > −βΠc∗. Then Fm(D = 1) = 0 is an
              | equilibrium since the maximum bid of the competing Þrms can not block the merger.
              | Furthermore, any contingent bid by competitors Fc(D = 0) is a best reply. Q.E.D.
              | In this region, the level of eﬃciency is such that competitors are harmed by the
              | merger and would want to inßuence the antitrust agency to block it. We therefore have
              | opposing interests on the part of the Þrms. In principle, the competitors might lose more
              | from the mergers than what the merger entails in terms of welfare gains, i.e. is possible
              | that Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ < −βΠc∗. In this case, where competitors are badly hurt by a
              | merger, they are capable to compensate the agency for the loss of welfare that would
              | arise if the merger is prohibited. However, as the above lemma shows, the merging Þrms
              | are always able to neutralize the bids by the competitors, which implies that the merger
              | will always go through. The agency does not make an error but there is a social cost
              | associated with lobbying. When the maximum bid of the competitors could not overturn
              | the merger even if the merging Þrms do not bid (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ < −βΠc∗), the merging
              | Þrms do not bid and there is no waste.
              | In sum, we Þnd that relative to the adjacent parameter range (i.e. to the left of e0),
              | the emergence of opposing interests among Þrms does not change the outcome of the
              | merger decision, but may introduce lobbying activity, and hence some an ineﬃciency.
              | When there is no interest which dominates, the merging Þrms, which can always trump
meta          | 9
text          | the competitors, has to lobby. In this case, the agency obtains some rent from the
              | political economy interaction.

              | 3.3.2
              | Consumer surplus standard
              | Assume that the agency is assigned the consumer surplus standard. As before, we Þrst
              | focus on the parameter region for which Þrms incentives are aligned (e ≤ e0), such that
              | Fm(D = 0) = Fc(D = 0) = 0. We Þrst consider the region such that e ≤ ∼e, i.e. where

              | Lemma 4 Let e ≤ ∼e. Firms will not bid and the merger is blocked.
              | Proof: The agency will allow the merger iﬀ U2(D = 1) = CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) + (α −
              | ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 1) ≥ 0. This can not hold since Πc∗(e) + Π∗m(e) + CS∗(e) ≤ 0 for
              | e ≤ ∼e. The merger is blocked and it is optimal for Þrms not to bid. Q.E.D.
              | In this region, both the change in consumer surplus and welfare are non-positive.
              | Hence, Þrms do not have suﬃcient resources to compensate the antitrust agency for the
              | loss of consumers surplus that a merger would entail. As a result, Þrms do not bid and
              | the merger is prohibited.
              | Let us now focus on eﬃciency level above ∼e, such that ∼e < e < e0. In this region, the
              | change in consumers surplus is still negative and Þrms might be able to provide enough
              | incentive to the agency in order to get the merger approved. Given the decision of the
              | agency in stage 3, Þrms will have to ensure that U2(D = 1) ≥ 0. Consider the highest
              | amount that Þrms can bid, i.e. their entire proÞt. The resulting value of the utility of the
              | agency if the merger is allowed is then given by S2∗(e) = CS∗ + αΠ∗m + (α − ε(N − M ))Πc∗.
              | Let e∗2 be the eﬃciency level such that S2∗(e∗2) = 0. Note that S2∗(e) is continuous and
              | monotonically increasing in e by A1 and A2. Since S2∗(∼e) < 0 and S2∗(e0) > 0 it follows
              | that ∼e < e∗2 < e0 and that it is unique.
              | Lemma 5 For ∼e < e < e∗2 Þrms do not bid and the merger is blocked. For e∗2 ≤ e < e0
              | Þrms bid such that U2(D = 1) = 0 and the merger is allowed.
              | Proof : Let ∼e < e < e∗2. In this case, S2∗(e) < 0, which implies that the merger is
              | blocked even if Þrms bid their entire proÞts. Hence, Þrms will not bid and the merger
              | is blocked. Let e∗2 ≤ e < e0, which implies that S2∗(e) ≥ 0 . Any pair of bids such
              | that Fm(D = 1), Fc(D = 1) such that U2(D = 1) = 0 is an equilibrium. The merger is

text          | As eﬃciency increases beyond the level at which welfare is unchanged, proÞts increase
              | and the harm to consumers falls. There is a region (∼e < e < e∗2) for which the proÞts are
              | still insuﬃcient to provide adequate incentives to the antitrust agency and the merger is
              | prohibited even though it would increase welfare. In this region, there is a type I error
              | but no social waste associated with lobbying. Beyond this level of eﬃciency (e∗2 ≤ e < e0),

              | is unaﬀected, the bids and hence the social waste converge to zero.

              | Proof : See proof of Lemma 3, which applies mutatis mutandis.
              | In this region, the level of eﬃciency is such that competitors are harmed by the
              | merger and would want to inßuence the antitrust agency to block the merger. In the
              | case where competitors are badly hurt by a merger (CS∗ < −βΠc∗), they are capable
              | to compensate the agency for the loss in consumer surplus that would arise if the merger
              | is prohibited. In this case, the merging Þrms, which can always trump the competitors,
              | need to compensate for the maximum bid that competitors can lodge. The agency
              | make no error in its decision but lobbying leads to social waste and some rent for the
              | antitrust agency. When the maximum bid of competitors cannot compensate for the
              | change in consumer surplus, the merging Þrms do not need to bid and there is no waste
              | In sum, we Þnd (as in the case of the welfare standard) that the merger is allowed
              | despite opposing interest. Under the consumer surplus standard, the merger is pushed
              | through, to the left of e0, by a joint action of the mergers Þrms and their competitors
              | . To the right, the merger might be pushed through again by the action by the merging
              | Þrms which compensate for that of the competitors. When lobbying is taking place,
              | some ineﬃciency will also arise. Comparing the condition in Lemma 6 with Lemma
              | 3, we Þnd that the condition for a wasteful equilibrium to exist is stricter for the
              | welfare standard. This implies that there exist parameter regions for which equilibrium
              | under the welfare standard does not involve any bidding, while the equilibrium under the
              | consumer surplus standard does involve bidding (and therefore waste). The reverse is
              | not true. In addition, the bid of the merging Þrms under the consumer surplus standard
              | (Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc∗ − CS∗) is always higher than the bid under the welfare standard
              | (Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc − (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗)).

              | When e∗1 ≤ e < ∼e, mergers are still prevented under the consumer surplus standard,
              | no bids are put forward and the Þrst best is achieved (W∧ = W2 = 0). By contrast, under
meta          | 12
text          | the welfare standard, Þrms bid and the merger is allowed. This introduces two types of
              | ineﬃciencies: (i) the merger is allowed even though it yields a negative welfare, so that
              | there is a type II error, and (ii) there is waste associated with the bids. The sum of
              | the two ineﬃciencies add up to the value of the bids (so that W1 − W2 = −(Fm + Fc)).
              | The reason is that the eﬀective value of the bid (the part which is not wasted) has to
              | compensate exactly for the loss of welfare in equilibrium. The ineﬃciency, which is the
              | loss of welfare and the wasted part of the bids, is thus equal to the bids. Furthermore,
              | the magnitude of the bids falls as the eﬃciency gains of the merger increase (see Figure
              | 3). At e = ∼e, Þrms do not need to bid any longer since the merger does not decrease
              | welfare.
              | When ∼e ≤ e < e∗2, under the welfare standard Þrms do not bid and the merger is
              | ∧
              | allowed so that the Þrst best is achieved (W1 = W = Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗). Under the
              | consumer surplus standard, the merger is blocked but Þrms do not put forward any
              | bid. There is thus a type I error: a merger which increases welfare is blocked and
              | W1 − W2 = Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗. Given that welfare increases in e, the opportunity cost of
              | not allowing the merger increases as the eﬃciency gain rises (see Figure 3).
              | When e∗2 ≤ e < e0, under the welfare standard, the Þrst best is achieved. Under the
              | consumer surplus standard, Þrms bid and the merger is allowed. There is no type I
              | error but there is waste associated with bidding, such that W1 − W2 = (1 − α)Fm + (1 −
              | α + ε(N − M ))Fc. Note that for e = e∗2, the entire proÞt is bid and the proportion of
              | the proÞt which is not wasted is equal to the loss in consumer surplus. Therefore, the
              | change in welfare at e∗2 is equal to zero. As a result W1 − W2 is continuous at e = e∗2.
              | Moreover, as eﬃciency gains increase, the waste in bidding falls (down to 0 at e0).
              | Overall, it appears that neither standard dominates over the entire range of param-
              | eters, even though one of the two standards is always Þrst best for any given eﬃciency
              | level. Consumer surplus and welfare standard give rise to diﬀerent types of costs de-
              | pending on the eﬃciency level. On the one hand, a number of relatively ineﬃcient
              | mergers  which decrease welfare  are pushed through under a welfare standard. On
              | the other hand, some relatively eﬃcient mergers (which would increase welfare) are pro-
              | hibited under the consumer surplus standard. This result accord with intuition; when
              | the agency is supposed to consider welfare but Þrms can inßuence the agency, one would
              | indeed expect the outcome to be biased in favour of Þrms and against consumers. With
              | a welfare standard, lobbying activity thus lowers welfare.5
              | 5Note however that if all interests were equally represented and equally eﬃcient in their lobbying,
              | the welfare standard would not give rise to any error. It is a standard feature of common agency games
              | that when the agent has a welfare standard and the principals bid their marginal beneÞt, the agent
              | mimics the behaviour of an independent agent which would simply maximise welfare (see for instance
meta          | 13
text          | By contrast, when the agency defends consumers interest, it will be biased against
              | the interest of Þrms and tend to prohibit mergers that enhance welfare. Firms lobbying
              | activity will tend to compensate for the narrow objective of the agency and thereby
              | reduce the range of relatively eﬃcient mergers that are prohibited. Without lobbying,
              | all mergers in between ∼e and e0 would be prohibited with a loss in welfare equal to
              | Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗. With lobbying, the welfare loss is strictly smaller for the region between
              | e∗2 and e0 (see Figure 3). Under the consumer surplus standard, lobbying thus strictly
              | improves welfare.
              | A comparison between the two standards over the entire range of parameters can
              | also be undertaken. However, such a comparison requires an explicit assumption about
              | the distribution of mergers that the agency will face in terms of their eﬃciency level.
              | This distribution is also likely to have a strong inßuence on the eventual outcome of
              | the comparison. For instance, it is likely that if the expected population of mergers is
              | biased in favour of very eﬃcient mergers, the consumer surplus standard will dominate.
              | At the opposite, if the distribution of expected mergers features a high density of rather
              | ineﬃcient mergers, it is likely that a consumer surplus standard will be preferred. In
              | addition, an explicit comparison of the two standards would require a speciÞc assumption
              | about the distribution of lobbying eﬀorts between merging Þrms and their competitors
              | (given that action by the latter is less eﬃcient than action by the former). Again, this
              | assumption might matter a great deal for the outcome of the comparison and would
              | be some somewhat arbitrary. Hence, rather than make explicit assumptions about
              | the distribution of expected mergers and the allocation of lobbying eﬀort and derive
              | an explicit comparison between the two standard, we focus on comparative statics. In
              | particular, we next examine how the comparison between the two standards would be
              | aﬀected by a change in the eﬃciency of the lobbying process and a change in the size of
              | the mergers.

              | all welfare enhancing mergers would be allowed in our model and all welfare decreasing mergers would
              | be prohibited. However, the Þrst best would still not be obtained as a potentially large amount of waste
              | would occur because of lobbying. In addition, if the merging Þrms, the competitors and consumers
              | were not equally eﬃcient in lobbying or if lobbying entailed some Þxed cost, the equilibrium under the

text          | The trade-oﬀ between welfare and consumer sur-
              | plus standards
              | Let us Þrst characterise the trade-oﬀ between the two standards with respect to the eﬃ-
              | ciency of the lobbying process. As discussed above, more transparency in the operation
              | of the anti-trust agency will tend to increase the amount of resources which is wasted
              | in lobbying. In the context of our model, a more eﬃcient process of lobbying is thus
              | associated with less transparency. An increase in α or a decrease in ε are associated
              | with a more eﬃcient process of lobbying.
              | We Þrst characterise (Proposition 1) how the various parameter regions are aﬀected
              | by a change in α and ε. A full comparison between the two standards, however, needs
              | to consider how the absolute levels of the governments objective function is aﬀected.
              | This will be undertaken in the subsequent proposition.
              | Proposition 1 With a more eﬃcient lobbying process, the eﬃciency region over which
              | the consumer surplus standard (CSS) is dominated is unchanged and the eﬃciency region
              | over which the CSS dominates increases.
              | Proof : By deÞnition of ∼e and e0 and by A1 and the monotonicity of S1∗(.) and S2∗(.),
              | we have that ∂∂eα1∗ < 0, ∂∂eα2∗ < 0, ∂∂∼αe = ∂∂eα0 = 0 and ∂∂eε1∗ > 0, ∂∂eε2∗ > 0, ∂∂∼εe = ∂∂eε0 = 0. Q.E.D.
              | Proposition 1 illustrates that a more eﬃcient lobbying process increases the set of
              | parameters for which mergers that decrease welfare are pushed through under a welfare
              | standard (i.e. in between e∗1 and ∼e). This accords with intuition; as a higher share of
              | proÞt can be used to eﬀectively inßuence the agency, mergers which require marginally
              | more inßuence over the agency can now be pushed through.
              | By contrast, the eﬃciency of the lobbying process does not aﬀect the range of pa-
              | rameters for which ineﬃcient outcomes occur under a consumer surplus standard, since
              | neither ∼e nor e0 are eﬀected by the eﬃciency of the lobbying process. The reason for this
              | is that the ineﬃcient outcomes near ∼e cannot be pushed through by Þrms. A marginal
              | increase in eﬃciency does not change this. Also, in the upper limit of the ineﬃciency
              | region (near e0) only a marginal amount of resources is necessary to push the merger
              | through at this point and more eﬃcient lobbying does not aﬀect the outcome.
              | Hence, it appears that in terms of parameters ranges, the consumer surplus standard
              | becomes more attractive than the welfare standard as the eﬃciency of lobbying increases.
              | The next proposition examines how the value of the governments objective function
              | is aﬀected by more eﬃcient lobbying.

text          | Proposition 2 In the eﬃciency region where the CSS is dominated, the net cost of the
              | CSS is reduced for more eﬃcient lobbying process. When the CSS dominates, the eﬀect
              | of a more eﬃcient lobbying process on the net beneÞt of the CSS is ambiguous.
              | Proof: Let us Þrst consider the region e∗2 ≤ e < e0 . The net cost of the CSS using
              | the above Lemmata 7 and 8 is W1 − W2 = (1 − α)Fm + (1 − α + ε(N − M ))Fc. From
              | the equilibrium conditions in stage 2 (Lemma 5) for any e, αFm + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc
              | does not change with α (or ε ). Hence, when α increases (or ε falls), Fm + Fc falls.
              | Since (1 − α) and Fm + Fc fall in α (increase in ε ), it follows that W1 − W2 falls in α
              | (increases in ε ). Consider now the region ∼e ≤ e < e∗2. In this region (see Lemmata 7
              | and 8) we have W1 − W2 = Πm + Πc + CS, which is independent of α (or ε ). Since,
              | ∂e∗2/∂α < 0 and ∂e∗2/∂ε > 0 by Proposition 1, the Þrst part of the proposition follows.
              | For the second part of the proposition consider the region e∗1 ≤ e < ∼e. We focus on the
              | comparative statics of α . The proof for ε is analogous. By Proposition 1 ∂e∗1/∂α < 0,
              | so that we Þrst consider e∗1 + ∂e∗1/∂α < e < ∼e. In this region from Lemmata 7 and 8
              | we have W1 − W2 = −Fm − Fc, which is increasing in α by the equilibrium condition in
              | Lemma 2. Since, ∂e∗1/∂α < 0, there is a new region where the CSS is dominated, i.e.
              | W1 − W2 < 0. Q.E.D.
              | The Proposition is illustrated in Figure 4 and oﬀers two useful insights. The Þrst
              | insight relates to the parameter range for which the consumer surplus standard yields an
              | ineﬃcient outcome. As discussed, this parameter range is not aﬀected by the eﬃciency
              | of lobbying. However, Proposition 2 illustrates that the type of ineﬃciency that occurs
              | in this range is aﬀected by the eﬃciency of lobbying: as lobbying becomes more eﬃcient,
              | the range of parameter for which a type I errors occurs shrinks and the range of parameter
              | for which lobbying occurs, and implies some waste, will increase (see Figure 4). In other
              | words, as lobbying becomes more eﬃcient, more resources are available at the margin
              | to inßuence the antitrust agency and mergers which require marginally more inßuence
              | can eﬀectively be pushed through. As a result the range of parameters for which a type
              | I error occurs shrinks, and more mergers are pushed through.
              | In addition, a type I error always entails a higher eﬃciency loss than lobbying in
              | this parameter range (see Figure 4 again). The waste associated with lobbying is only
              | a fraction of the loss entailed by prohibiting the merger which is the entire opportunity
              | cost of the merger in terms of welfare. Hence, a reduction of type I errors will reduce
              | the cost associated with the consumer surplus standard in this area.
              | Consequently, there are two reasons as to why the cost associated with the consumer
              | surplus standard falls when lobbying becomes more eﬃcient. First, more eﬃcient lob-
              | bying implies that fewer resources are wasted for any eﬃciency level for which lobbying
meta          | 16
text          | occurs. Second, more eﬃcient lobbying also reduces the range of parameters for which a
              | type I error occurs and this reduces the cost of the consumer surplus standard because
              | for any eﬃciency level, a type I error is more costly than the waste associated with
              | successful lobbying. This result which will be useful for further reference is collected in
              | Lemma 9.
              | Lemma 9 In the eﬃciency region where the CSS is dominated, the net cost of the CSS
              | increases in e∗2, holding ∼e and e0 constant.
              | Proof: Follows from Proposition 2.
              | The second insight oﬀered by Proposition 2 relates to the parameter region where
              | mergers that decrease welfare are pushed through by lobbying under the welfare stan-
              | dard. As discussed above, more eﬃcient lobbying (less transparency) extends the range
              | of mergers for which a type II error occurs under the welfare standard. At the same
              | time, for any value of the eﬃciency parameter for which the merger is pushed through,
              | less resources are wasted in inßuencing the government (see Figure 4). As a result the
              | impact of more eﬃcient lobbying is ambiguous. This trade-oﬀ also illustrates the eﬀect
              | of transparency. On the one hand, transparency is desirable because it will reduce the
              | scope of undesirable deals that Þrms can manage to push through. On the other hand,
              | transparency is undesirable because it imposes a constraint on Þrms that they can only
              | circumvent at great cost.
              | We next characterise the trade-oﬀ with respect to market structure.
              | Proposition 3 The larger the size of the merger, the larger the eﬃciency region over
              | which the CSS dominates, and the larger the eﬃciency region over which the CSS is
              | dominated. Moreover, when the CSS is dominated, the eﬃciency regions for which Type
              | I errors occur shrinks relative to the eﬃciency region for which waste occurs.
              | Proof: We Þrst consider the region where the CSS dominates. Note that A3 can be
              | ∼
              | written as ∂S∗/∂M < 0. The deÞnition of ∼e then implies that ∂ ∼e/∂M > 0 , i.e. ∼e moves
              | to the right (see also Figure 5). If ∂S1∗/∂M > 0 (i.e. when merger size has a strong
              | eﬀect on industry proÞts), then ∂e∗1/∂M < 0, which implies that the region is getting
              | larger. If ∂S1/∂M < 0, then ∂e∗1/∂M > 0, i.e. e∗1 moves to the right. By A3 and A4 and
              | ∼ ∼
              | since ε0(N − M ) > 0, we have ∂S1∗/∂M > ∂S∗/∂M . Since ∂S1∗/∂e > ∂S∗/∂e it follows
              | that ∂ ∼e/∂M > ∂e∗1/∂M , i.e. the function that has e∗1 as a Þxed point shifts by less and
              | is steeper than the function, which has ∼e as a Þxed point, so that ∼e moves faster to the
              | right than e∗1 as M increases. We next consider the region where the CSS is dominated.

              | Since ∂CS∗/∂e < ∂S∗/∂e it follows that ∂ ∼e/∂M < ∂e0/∂M , i.e. the function that

              | last statement of the proposition. By A3 and A4 and since ε0(N − M ) > 0, we have
              | ∂S2∗/∂M > ∂CS∗/∂M . Since ∂S2∗/∂e > ∂CS∗/∂e it follows that ∂e0/∂M > ∂e∗2/∂M ,

              | Proposition 3 indicates that in the presence of larger mergers, both standards perform
              | relatively worse, to the extent that the range of parameters for which either standard
              | yields ineﬃcient outcomes increases.
              | Consider those mergers which reduce welfare but are pushed through under the wel-
              | fare standard. Larger mergers tend to reduce welfare for any level of the eﬃciency
              | parameter, so that in principle Þrms have to provide more inducement in order to push
              | them through (i.e. ∼e moves right - see Figure 5). However, larger mergers also enhance
              | the proÞts that are available to provide inducement to the agency. Under the assump-
              | tions of our model6, the latter eﬀect always dominates the former so that the range of
              | parameters for which ineﬃcient mergers are pushed through increases.
              | Proposition 3 also illustrates that increasing the size of a merger does not necessarily
              | lead to more regulatory clearance. When increasing the size of mergers has a strong
              | eﬀect on the industry proÞts, more precisely when ∂∂SM1∗ > 0, then e∗1 moves left (see the
              | proof of proposition 3), regulatory clearance will never be jeopardised by larger mergers.
              | However, when the eﬀect of larger mergers on industry proÞts is smaller, more precisely
              | ∂∂SM1∗ < 0, then e∗1 moves right but by less than ∼e. In this case, there will be a range of
              | eﬃciency parameters for which regulatory clearance will be jeopardised as the merger
              | becomes larger.
              | Consider the range of eﬃciency parameters for which the consumer surplus standard
              | yields an ineﬃcient outcome. As mergers become larger, both welfare and consumer
              | surplus are reduced (so that both ∼e and e0 shift right). Under the assumptions of our
              | model, the eﬀect on consumer surplus is greater than the eﬀect on welfare so the range
              | of parameter for which the consumer surplus standard yields an ineﬃcient outcome
              | increases (e0 moves further to the right than ∼e). However, Proposition 3 also shows (see
              | the proof) that e0 moves further to the right than e∗2, which implies that the relative
              | size of the regions for which a type I error occurs under the consumer surplus standard
              | 6It follows from the fact that welfare is less aﬀected by eﬃciency than industry proÞts and by the
              | fact that welfare is an average of proÞt (which increase with merger size) and consumer surplus (which
              | decreases with merger size).

text          | tends to shrink relative to the region for which there is wasteful lobbying. The reason
              | is as follows: when the size of the mergers increases, consumers surplus fall and more
              | inducement has to provided to the agency. However, industry proÞts also increase so
              | that more inducement is available. As before, under the assumptions of our model7,
              | the latter eﬀect dominates the former and the range of parameter for which successful
              | lobbying arises increases. As a consequence, the range of parameter for which a type
              | I error occurs will shrink relative to the range for which successful  but wasteful 
              | lobbying arises.
              | Having considered how the ranges of eﬃciency parameters for either standard is inef-
              | Þcient change with merger size, the next propositions analyses how merger size changes
              | the relative costs and beneÞts of the two standards.
              | Proposition 4 When the CSS dominates, larger mergers increase the net beneÞt of the
              | CSS standard, whenever ∂∂SM1∗ > 0, i.e. when increasing merger size has a strong eﬀect
              | on industry proÞts.
              | Proof: Consider the region where the CSS dominates. By A3 and Lemma 2, we know
              | that Fm+Fc increases in M . Using Lemmata 7 and 8, it follows that ∂(W1−W2)/∂M < 0
              | in this region. When ∂∂SM1∗ > 0 , e∗1 moves left and the net beneÞt of the CSS increases.
              | Q.E.D.
              | The intuition behind this proposition is straightforward. As discussed above, when
              | increasing the size of mergers has a strong eﬀect on industry proÞts, it will never jeop-
              | ardise regulatory clearance. In other words, the range of eﬃciency parameters for which
              | the mergers are pushed through with a given merger size includes the set of eﬃciency
              | parameters for which the mergers are pushed through with any lower merger size. In
              | addition, for any value of the eﬃciency parameter, a larger merger size implies that the
              | type II error is more costly and that a stronger inducement (hence more waste) has to
              | be provided to the agency to push the merger through. In those circumstances, the cost
              | of the welfare standard it thus unambiguously greater.
              | When increasing the size of mergers has a weaker eﬀect on industry proÞts, the
              | matter is less clear. In those circumstances e∗1 moves right, and some larger mergers
              | (with low eﬃciency) are blocked, which is Þrst best.
              | Proposition 5 When the CSS is dominated the eﬀect of larger mergers on the net cost
              | of the CSS is ambiguous. However, the CSS is more attractive with larger mergers
              | whenever the lobbying is eﬃcient, and when marginal co-ordination costs are high.
              | 7It follows from the fact that consumer surplus is less aﬀected by eﬃciency than industry proÞts and
              | by the fact that welfare is an average of proÞt (which increase with merger size) and consumer surplus
              | (which decreases with merger size).

text          | Proof : Note that ∂ ∼e/∂M and ∂e0/∂M are unaﬀected by α, β, and ε0. Further note
              | that ∂S2∗/∂M is increasing in α, β, and ε0 which implies that ∂2e∗2/∂M ∂α, ∂2e∗2/∂M ∂β,
              | and ∂2e∗2/∂M ∂ε0 are negative. The result follows then from Lemma 9. Q.E.D.
              | Proposition 5 conÞrms that the eﬀect of merger size on the cost of the consumer
              | surplus standard is ambiguous. This should not come as a surprise given that increasing
              | the merger size both increases and shifts rightward the range of parameters for which
              | the consumer surplus standard yields an ineﬃcient outcome.
              | The second part of the proposition uncovers a complementarity between merger size
              | and the eﬃciency of the lobbying process: the eﬀect of merger size on the range over
              | which the consumer surplus standard yields ineﬃcient outcomes is unaﬀected by the
              | eﬃciency of lobbying. But the eﬀect of merger size on the region over which a type
              | I error occurs within that range is negatively inßuenced by the eﬃciency of lobbying.
              | The more eﬃcient the lobbying, the more the region over which type I errors occurs will
              | shrink when merger size increases. Hence, not only does lobbying reduce the cost of the
              | consumer surplus standard on it own right (see above), but it also make the consumer
              | surplus standard more attractive when merger size increases.
              | Collecting the above results, we Þnd that eﬃcient lobbying and large mergers rein-
              | force each other in reducing the cost the consumer surplus standard in regions where it
              | yields an ineﬃcient outcome. Where the welfare standard yields ineﬃcient outcomes,
              | large mergers make matters worse independently of the eﬃciency of lobbying (at least
              | when larger mergers have a strong eﬀect on industry proÞts).

text          | Conclusion
              | This paper evaluates alternative rules that can be assigned to a merger control agency
              | which can be inßuenced by interested parties. We Þnd that neither a welfare standard nor
              | a consumer surplus standard dominates. The consumer surplus and welfare standard also
              | give rise to diﬀerent types of ineﬃciencies: relatively ineﬃcient mergers  which decrease
              | welfare  are pushed through under a welfare standard, while relatively eﬃcient mergers
              | (which would increase welfare) are prohibited under the consumer surplus standard.
              | While lobbying activity is undesirable under a welfare standard, it raises welfare under
              | a consumer surplus standard.
              | The process of lobbying - as characterized by transparency and co-ordination costs -
              | is shown to be important in terms of the relative performance of the two standards. Both
              | transparency as well as co-ordination costs make lobbying less eﬀective. Under a welfare
              | standard this has two eﬀects. On the one hand, it will reduce the scope of undesirable
              | deals that Þrms can manage to push through. On the other hand, transparency and
meta          | 20
text          | co-ordination costs impose a constraint that Þrms can only circumvent at a cost. By
              | contrast, transparency or co-ordination costs do not aﬀect the scope of deals for which
              | a consumer surplus standard is ineﬃcient. It only aﬀects the balance between wrong
              | decisions and waste in lobbying. For instance, more transparency actually shift the
              | balance towards wrong decisions because it reduces Þrmss eﬀectiveness in lobbying.
              | Since wrong decisions are socially more costly than lobbying, transparency is actually
              | not desirable under a consumer surplus standard.
              | We also Þnd that the size of the proposed merger has a diﬀerent impact on the
              | performance of the two standards. Under the welfare standard, there are two eﬀects.
              | On the one hand, larger mergers, which have more resources to lobby the agency, manage
              | to push more numerous deals through, despite the fact that larger deals are also less
              | desirable in terms of welfare (and hence require more lobbying to be pushed through).
              | On the other hand, the deals that are pushed through may on average be less damaging
              | so that the overall eﬀect is ambiguous. Still, when industry proÞts are strongly aﬀected
              | by the size of the merger, the former eﬀect will dominate and the welfare standard will
              | perform relatively worse.
              | The matter is diﬀerent for a consumer surplus standard. The range of deals for which
              | ineﬃcient outcomes arise increases with larger mergers. But larger mergers also tend to
              | shift the balance away from wrong decisions and in favour of wasteful lobbying (because
              | Þrms have more resources). As result, the performance of the consumer surplus standard
              | is not unambiguously worse with larger mergers. In addition, we observe that larger
              | mergers will shift the balance away from decisions errors more Þrmly when transparency
              | is low. Hence, low transparency and larger mergers are circumstances that reinforce
              | each other in making a consumer surplus standard more attractive.
              | These Þndings suggest that a reform of the standard that is assigned to a competition
              | agency needs to consider the institutional environment in which the agency operates and
              | the population of cases that the agency is likely to consider. For instance, it may not
              | be appropriate for the EU to move towards a welfare standard unless the transparency
              | of its procedure is greatly improved. The average size of proposed mergers has been
              | unusually large in the recent merger wave (see European Economy, 1999). If one expects
              | this feature to persist, our analysis would imply that maintaining a consumer surplus
              | standard may be appropriate.
