              | Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida

              | Abstract: This article explores significant notions of home and belonging among first- and second-
              | generation Cuban immigrants in South Florida. The analyses are derived from biographical
              | narrative interviews with six Cuban Americans. Three key subjects were in the biographical life
              | stories—the notion of escape or leaving, the sense of home, and constructions of Cuban identity. In
              | assessing these themes, we found there to be profound differences between the generations.
              | Moreover, these Cuban biographies demonstrate how differing stories of migration provide new
              | theoretical perspectives on immigration, transnationalism, and ethnicity. The experiences presented
              | and discussed here connect to the ambivalence and complexity of belongingness and
              | interpretations of Cuban-ness.

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | 1. Introduction
              | How do immigrants from Cuba and their children characterize their sense of
              | belonging and identity in the United States? Do first- and second-generation
              | immigrants differ in conceptualizing home, and if so, in what ways? How do
              | Cubans from different waves of emigration understand the transnational
              | experience of leaving and settling? These are the questions explored in this
              | article, which is part of a larger qualitative study of ethnic identity and sense of
              | belonging among immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, and Guatemala in South Florida
              | (see CHAITIN, LINSTROTH, and HILLER's introductory article in this issue). [1]
              | This article presents analyses of interviews with six informants from among the
              | total sample of ten Cuban-American participants—first- and second-generation
              | Cuban immigrants. These six informants were chosen based on the factors of
              | gender, generation, and immigration pattern. In turn, we wanted to assess how
              | these particular characteristics influenced the experiences of these Cuban
              | participants. The ages of informants ranged from the mid-twenties to late-fifties,
              | and the sample was divided evenly between men and women. We identified
              | emergent themes in the biographical interviews, placed those themes within a
              | wider theoretical lens, and then explored our findings in relation to the sense of
              | home and identity. Furthermore, it should be noted our sample size was
              | particularly small since these were life-story interviews and our study followed
              | guidelines accorded to biographical-interviewing and the in-depth analyses of
              | only a few individuals. Below is a table providing information regarding the six
              | informants.

              | It is important to begin with a brief overview of Cuban history and the history of
              | Cuban immigration to the United States since the participants in this study had
              | very different immigration experiences. Following this discussion, we explore the
              | individual stories of six participants, focusing on three aspects of the immigrant
              | experience: the phenomenon of leaving, the sense of home, and perceptions of
              | ethnic and national identity. A common theme emerging from their stories is what

              | we termed "ambivalent belongings." This term refers to the simultaneous,
              | conflicting feelings our informants convey regarding home and identity, and which
              | we will discuss in detail below. [3]
              | 2. Socio-Historical Context
              | 2.1 Cuban history
              | Europeans first came to Cuba in the course of Columbus' seafaring explorations,
              | and in the years after 1492 the island came under Spanish control as a key
              | trading port and shipyard. With colonization, the indigenous population was
              | devastated by disease and forced hard labor, as occurred in other occupied
              | territories of the Caribbean and the Americas. Some native Cubans intermarried
              | with Spanish families, however, and native customs and words remained
              | interwoven in the island's culture and language (THOMAS, 1998). African slaves
              | were first brought to Cuba by the Spaniards in the early 1500s. The cultivation of
              | vast sugar cane plantations led to several hundreds of thousands of African
              | slaves being brought to Cuba to work the sugar cane fields over the next three
              | hundred years (THOMAS, 1998). [4]
              | In the 1800s, the Spanish colonists looked to the authority of Madrid, but many of
              | the Creole elite—people born in Cuba of Spanish ancestry—turned to North
              | America and even hoped to be incorporated as a territory into the United States.
              | Others among the Creole liberal and intellectual elite began promoting Cuban
              | nationhood in the latter half of the nineteenth century (BENJAMIN, 1990). The
              | Ten Years War (1868-1878) was a guerilla struggle for freedom from Spain.
              | Although this effort failed, it fostered widespread interest in independence. José
              | Martí, a Cuban émigré in the United States, combined the cause of independence
              | with a vision of social justice and worked in the exile population to develop
              | nationalism and the Partido Revolucianaro Cubano, the Cuban Revolutionary
              | Party (BENJAMIN, 1990). [5]
              | The Cuban War of Independence (1895-1898) ended Spanish sovereignty. With
              | United States intervention on behalf of independence in the so-called "Spanish-
              | American War" in 1898, the new Cuban citizens saw Spanish colonization
              | replaced by North American occupation. In 1902, U.S. occupation ended, and the
              | Cuban Republic was established. The Platt Amendment of the 1903 Permanent
              | Treaty with the United States, however, limited Cuban sovereignty for the next
              | two decades. The next several decades saw periods of political corruption and
              | instability under several governments. This instability continued until the mid 20th
              | century when Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar came to power. The corruption of the
              | Batista administration was a key factor leading to Castro's takeover of the
              | government (THOMAS, 1998; PEREZ, 1990; WHITNEY, 2001). [6]
              | Fidel Castro failed in his first effort to bring revolution to Cuba in 1953, and as a
              | result he was imprisoned. Castro received amnesty in 1955, however; he traveled
              | to Mexico, where he continued planning to overthrow Batista. In December of
              | 1956, Castro and his troops returned to Cuba, and a period of attacks, strikes,

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | and political unrest followed. On the eve of 1959, Batista fled the island, leading
              | to Castro's rise to power. Although he had broad support initially, due to
              | widespread frustration over the corruption of Batista's administration, Castro lost
              | favor with a growing segment of the population when he turned to a repressive
              | form of rule (ENCINOSA, 1988; BONACHEA & SAN MARTIN, 1974; LEONARD,
              | 1999; FARBER, 2006; PEREZ-STABLE, 1999). Various groups of Cubans,
              | beginning with the political and business elite, sought a way out of the repressive
              | system, leading to several waves of emigration. [7]
              | 2.2 Waves of Cuban emigration
              | For over 40 years, Cubans have been categorized as political refugees and have
              | been provided relatively easy entry into the United States compared to other
              | immigrant groups. Those Cuban immigrants who did not specifically fit the model
              | of a refugee under the United Nations Conventions were instead defined
              | according to criteria contained in the Walter-McCarran Act of 1952. This act
              | specifically identified someone who is fleeing a communist country as a refugee
              | (NACKERUD, SPRINGER, LARRISON, & ISAAC, 1999). There were four
              | specific "waves" of Cuban immigration into the United States: the Early Exiles
              | departure in the years 1959-1962, the "Freedom Flights" from 1965-1973, the
              | Mariel boatlift in 1980, and the Rafter Crisis in 1994, which led to the policy
              | known as "wet-foot, dry-foot." This policy allows Cubans to stay in the United
              | States and seek asylum if they touch U.S. land, but requires their return to Cuba
              | if they are intercepted in water (SELSKY, 2006). [8]
              | In the first few years following Castro's revolution, a number of upper class
              | refugees left the island as they saw their industries nationalized. This early wave
              | became known as the Early Exiles. From 1965-1973, middle class Cubans joined
              | the upper class in migrating in the so-called Freedom Flights. These airlifts were
              | conducted with the agreement of the Cuban and U.S. governments. Preference
              | was given to those persons who already had relatives in the United States and
              | Cuba banned the exit of young men of military age, professionals, and
              | technically-skilled workers. A specific subset of these flights were the "Peter Pan"
              | flights containing some 14,000 children sent by their parents in order to escape
              | communist indoctrination in state-run schools. In the end, these flights brought
              | more than a quarter of a million Cuban refugees to the United States (PEDRAZA-
              | BAILEY, 1985). [9]
              | The third wave of immigration was in 1980, the Mariel boatlift, bringing 125,000
              | Cuban refugees to the United States (COPELAND, 1983). This was a mass
              | exodus from Cuba. Initially, Cuban-American families boated 90 miles from Key
              | West, Florida, to Cuba to "rescue" family members. It ended with Cuban officials
              | forcing "undesirables" onto whatever boats were available and thousands of
              | Cubans fleeing the island-nation. Some participants left of their own volition.
              | Others were forced out. These immigrants were from the middle or lower classes;
              | many were of African descent, political prisoners, or homosexual. The American
              | press stressed the involvement of those that were forced to leave and labeled all
              | as undesirable. Despite the labels of "criminal" and "scum" given by the press,
              | © 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | however, the majority of the Mariel refugees were working class people with no
              | criminal record (PEDRAZA-BAILEY, 1985). [10]
              | Finally, there are the refugees who have come to the United State under the "wet-
              | foot/dry-foot" policy. This policy was precipitated by the Balsero Crisis during the
              | Clinton administration when Castro warned that he would open the Cuban
              | borders and allow anyone to leave who wished to do so. The Clinton
              | administration, fearing another mass exodus such as the Mariel boatlift,
              | determined to tighten the rules regarding Cuban entry into the U.S. and thus
              | created the new policy (NACKERUD et al., 1999). Because of the continued
              | Communist government, these immigrants are still termed political refugees.
              | However, the reality of the situation is that more and more are economic refugees
              | who cannot sustain themselves or their families in the impoverished Cuban
              | economy. Regardless of the motivations for migration, one result of these four
              | waves of emigration is that a large segment of South Florida's population has
              | Cuban ethnic roots. Over 650,000 Cuban immigrants live in Miami-Dade County
              | alone. This broad Cuban community has economic and political influence in
              | South Florida, especially in Miami (MORENO, n.d.). [11]
              | 2.3 The Cuba-United States relationship
              | We now turn to a short description of the mutual influence resulting from the
              | historical relationship between Cuba and the United States, a relationship that
              | has impacted the sense of home and belonging for Cuban immigrants. For some
              | two hundred years, the proximity of Cuba to southern Florida led to trade,
              | tourism, and commercial linkages (PEREZ, 1990). In the nineteenth century,
              | North Americans came to Cuba to invest in the sugar industry, while many
              | Cubans moved to Key West and Tampa to work in cigar factories. In the latter
              | half of the 1800s, wealthy Cubans traveled to North America to vacation or to
              | study. In the 1920s, working class Cubans came to Miami as entertainers and
              | workers (PEREZ, 1999). Political exiles, too, have made the short trip from Cuba
              | to the United States from the time of José Martí prior to independence from Spain.
              | Such political exile to the United States continued in the late 1920s and 1930s
              | and has been ongoing ever since to the present day (BENJAMIN, 1990). [12]
              | Following the war for Cuba's independence from Spain, the United States'
              | occupation of Cuba had a longstanding influence on the island. Aside from the
              | political ramifications, the U.S. presence left its mark on the culture and the
              | landscape of Cuba, as well. The period of occupation included massive
              | reconstruction, including the building of banks, stores, homes, and a new capitol
              | building all resembling U.S. architecture (PEREZ, 1999; BENJAMIN, 1990).
              | Meanwhile, North Americans developed a growing fascination with Cuba,
              | beginning in the 1920s and continuing through the 1950s, as a nearby destination
              | that was both exotic and tropical while maintaining old-world Spanish charm. At
              | the same time, as Miami grew, some neighborhoods were modeled after the style
              | of Havana; and hotels and housing developments were given Spanish names
              | (PEREZ, 1999, 1990). As a result of these mutual influences, when Cubans came
              | to South Florida as exiles, they found themselves in a nation that was clearly

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | different from their own, yet at the same time not completely strange. They were
              | in a region filled with Spanish street and town names, where architectural styles
              | and plants were similar to those in their homeland, and where they often had
              | relatives or business associates. Thus the land of exile was at once foreign and
              | familiar. [13]
              | 2.4 Cuban nationalism
              | Before turning to our results, it is also important to discuss briefly the history of
              | Cuban nationalism, since this relates to the construction of Cuban identity for
              | both first and second generation Cuban immigrants. For the majority of Cuba's
              | history, the notion of Cuba Libre (Free Cuba) has been at the core of the
              | imagined homeland. This democratic vision, popularized most famously by José
              | Martí in the fight for Cuban independence, served as the cherished dream
              | throughout years of colonization by Spain and occupation by the United States
              | prior to official statehood (BENJAMIN, 1990). Along with the establishment of the
              | Republic of Cuba, was the Platt Amendment, which allowed for United States'
              | interventionism in Cuban affairs and thereby instilled in most Cubans an
              | unfulfilled sense of independent-nationalism. It was not until the 1930s that
              | independence emerged, resulting in great national pride but short-lived
              | satisfaction. In the following decades, the strong-man rule of Machado and
              | Batista left Cubans seeking real freedom. At first, the revolution of Fidel and Raul
              | Castro was welcomed by many as offering hope for a democratic republic. With
              | the coming of the communist regime, however, many felt the dream of Cuba
              | Libre remained unfulfilled. As a result, most of Cuban history has consisted of
              | longing for an imagined free nation. This imagined belonging is an important part
              | of the continued identity that we found in our interviews with Cuban Americans.
              | We will see in the following analyses that the imagined homeland is a prominent
              | theme for both generations of Cuban immigrants. [14]
              | 3. Results and Analysis
              | 3.1 First generation immigrants
              | Among the six biographical interviews discussed in this article, four came from
              | the first generation of immigrants from Cuba. These immigrants had quite
              | different experiences, while their divergent views evoked distinct political eras
              | (ECKSTEIN & BARBERIA, 2002). Victor was a young adult when he left Cuba in
              | the early 1970s, having earned his visa by working several years in the sugar
              | cane fields. By contrast Martin is a few years younger than Victor, and
              | immigrated to the United States in 1988 after years as a political prisoner. These
              | two men experienced a Cuba prior to Castro's revolution, and in revolutionary
              | Cuba, their lives altered forever. Another interviewee, Nina, was a generation
              | younger and grew up in Havana under Castro's rule. She did not want to leave
              | Cuba, but eventually did so as a young adult when frustrated by the hardships.
              | Our informant Daniel, who was just a few years younger than Nina, migrated to
              | the United States at age seven with his parents in the Mariel boatlift. [15]

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | This article summarizes these different lives and interprets how our biographers
              | conceptualize their sense of belonging in relation to their immigrant experiences
              | from Cuba to the United States. [16]
              | 3.1.1 Victor's story
              | When asked to tell his life story, Victor immediately introduced the traumatic
              | impact of the Castro revelation. He begins his story, "Oh, well, I was very happy
              | in my country until the revolution; you know; they make laws until I didn't like it,
              | and I have to leave my country and leave my family." Victor's thoughts return
              | repeatedly to the impact of Castro on his life. Speaking of his childhood, Victor
              | says, "It's happy, it's normal, like a child, like every child. Very, very happy with
              | my family, loving parents, loving brothers and sisters." Then, after a long breath,
              | he says
              | "And we have to get separate because of the system, the new system ... I was so
              | happy. I was born in a fishing town. The ocean was very close; I like to swim, play like
              | every boy. ... Just the system changed, and everything changed you know, in my life,
              | and the life of all my family and the many families in Cuba ..." [17]
              | Victor explains that he was prohibited from pursuing abstract art, which was very
              | important to him. In addition, he was a practicing Catholic, and he said he was
              | sent to a labor camp to work in the sugar cane fields for several years because "I
              | was religious" and also in order to get a permit to leave the country. Victor
              | received a visa to Spain, and after a short time he traveled to New York City.
              | While he was able to see family members who had immigrated before him to the
              | United States, it was painful for him to leave family members behind in Cuba, as
              | well. Victor's experience of leaving Cuba was clearly traumatic, even though he
              | was not expelled from the country. As he explained, he chose to work toward
              | emigration by toiling on a sugar cane plantation for years in order to gain the
              | desired exit visa. Thus, he both wanted to leave and resented "having" to leave. [18]
              | When describing his experience as an immigrant in the United States, Victor
              | conveys similarly conflicted feelings.
              | "When I get New York, I am going to tell you the truth; I didn't like it at all. I wanted to
              | come back to Spain because New York was very different to our culture. But I have
              | my family, I have my girlfriend waiting for me, and then I decided to stay in this
              | country. That time it was hard because you don't get any help at all. ... My family help
              | me, but I like to have my own money. I started working. I work very hard. I didn't
              | speak any English at all, but I got a job cleaning a bar. I have to work at five in the
              | morning and take the subway and make a change in Times Square...I got lost many
              | times in that Times Square. It was very hard, but after that I got another job, I get
              | married, and everything was changing. I started loving this country I love now very
              | much. And then after that I didn't like the cold weather. After four years there, we
              | came to Florida on vacation. I love this weather; I love this state, and in six month ...
              | we move over here, and I start a new life here in Florida. It's still not that easy
              | because ... you have to work and you have to pay for everything. I repeat, I start

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | loving this country I still love a lot. And now I'm floral designer here and it's my actual
              | job, and I feel very good." [19]
              | Victor speaks of Cuba as "my country" and of the United States as "this country."
              | However his sense of belonging and home is more complex than these verbal
              | cues would indicate. He disliked the United States at first and found it difficult to
              | adjust. Nevertheless, he uses the word love several times to convey his current
              | feelings for "this country." It appears that Victor harbors doubts about his choice
              | to leave Cuba. The emphasis on loving the United States and Florida may
              | indicate an effort to convince himself he made the right choice. At the same time,
              | it might also reflect a genuine appreciation for the positive aspects of his life in
              | America. Therefore, we suggest Victor experiences both seemingly contradictory
              | feelings simultaneously, thus leading to an ambivalent sense of belonging. [20]
              | 3.1.2 Martin's story
              | Martin was born in 1955 and is a contemporary of Victor, but he did not leave
              | Cuba until 1988. Martin was imprisoned for several years for his political views
              | prior to his emigration and he told us that he was always interested in political
              | issues. By the time he was 17: "the State's Security began watching me, and they
              | thought that I could harm the government because I thought differently, and I had
              | courage to stand by my principles." Knowing he was being followed and in
              | danger, Martin attempted to escape Cuba by sneaking onto a merchant ship. This
              | escape attempt failed when the captain of the ship turned him in. He was
              | subsequently condemned to eight years in prison. [21]
              | Martin explains pressure from the Catholic Church led to the liberation of many
              | political prisoners and he was among the fortunate ones. While he was trying to
              | arrange his departure from the island, he was re-arrested for both possessing
              | enemy propaganda and trying to escape and was sentenced to 20 years in
              | prison. Martin was released in 1988 due to international pressure on Cuba to
              | release political prisoners. Speaking of his immigration to the United States,
              | Martin says,
              | "I came with the illusion to be a savior ... with that desire of continuing to fight for
              | Cuba's freedom, for the things that one believes in. But ... at the same time, when
              | you come by yourself, to a country it is so hard, you live with no knowing the
              | language, without knowing the city. You don't know anything. You have to start from
              | scratch; it's very hard. I've worked very hard. Thank God, never I've had to ask the
              | government for aid. I've never felt inferior to Americans or anyone else. And, really,
              | I've done well ... because I've worked hard, because I'm a serious person and believe
              | that every day will be better. I have worked very hard. I'm a bus driver with Dade-
              | County. I'm not doing bad, and I'm well off! I've never blamed this country because I
              | see that people come here blaming this country. They criticize what is bad with this
              | country. When I had it bad it was because I had no luck or because I was lazy or
              | because of personal problems not because the country did not provide me with the
              | opportunity." [22]

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | Martin echoes Victor's emphasis on the need to work hard and also emphasizes
              | the success he ultimately achieved in the United States. As he continued his
              | story, Martin spoke of his admiration for the democracy of the United States. He
              | specifically discussed the free press and the freedom to criticize the president as
              | being something he cherished. He also noted that Cubans will not have political
              | conversations on the phone because they have been "programmed" to believe
              | the State is tapping their phone lines. Martin commented,
              | "This country gives you the possibility for you to grow, whatever they say ... Chaplin
              | used to say that motherland is where you work, had freedom, and lived. Well, I don't
              | know. I don't think that this is my motherland but that Cuba is my motherland. But it
              | could be when I go back that Cuba is not going to be the same." [23]
              | Martin's reflections on Cuban identity indicated both pride and disappointment.
              | "I believe that us Cubans, we are a little hard to deal with, but I have never felt
              | inferior. I am seeing the people that have come not so many years ago are not the
              | same people that came here in '59. Is not the same; is a different world. [Castro]
              | wanted to create a new order. According to him ... everything that was refined or
              | everything that rich people liked or everything that was liked by the bourgeoisie was
              | something nauseating, it was something bad. That's why ... all those refined things
              | went on a downward spiral because they began changing an order that was a bit
              | bourgeois to the so-called proletariat order of the workers. The women were dressed
              | as militia men and would cut sugar cane and worked in construction because women
              | were the same as men. And all of that brought about a liberalization, a vulgarity, a
              | tremendous low neighborhood vulgarity ... that's why for me Cubans are not the
              | same. For example, my nephew came who an airhead, and he came with ideas...is
              | telling me things, thinking that what he was telling me I was going to see him as a
              | hero. He doesn't know that what he was telling me is that he was an idiot and that he
              | was a person that was no good that was worthless. 'Cause for me, anyone who tells
              | me that he is a gigolo and all those things, I can't see those things as good ...
              | The first Cubans, they were really the wealthy Cuban class that had to flee the island,
              | the cultural class and the people who opposed the regime and the militaries from the
              | previous regime. Those people ... were brilliant people—entrepreneurs, physicians,
              | etc. ... those people have a tremendous merit because they were the first that had to
              | wash dishes over here, the people whose children later on went to college. ...That is
              | the old Cuban-ness ... I don't think that Cubans who come now are going to create
              | anything. It's already created. And it's an old Cuban-ness that inserted itself in a world
              | of democracy, in a world of North American development, but with the spirit and the
              | Cuban essence ... I think Cuba is a creature very, what I suspect is terrible. Those
              | same Cubans that say over here, 'I go over there,' that's a lie, that's an ideal. There
              | are thinkers that say that there is a Cuba in the mind; in reality, that doesn't exist
              | anymore. In reality, that Cuba beautiful, that doesn't exist. Those people have
              | destroyed our homeland." [24]

              | 3.1.3 Nina's story
              | While Nina was born a generation after Victor and Martin, she frames her life
              | story in the context of the Castro revolution. Nina describes what might be called
              | "imagined memories." These are scenes and facts that she was too young to
              | recall herself, but to which she relates as if they came from firsthand experience.
              | "The year that I was born is called año de la ofensiva revolucionaria [the year of the
              | revolutionary offensive]. Why was it called like that? Because it is the year when the
              | last existing private businesses in Cuba are nationalized. That means that the people
              | who had little businesses like bodegas ... a stand at the corner, it was over, and all
              | the people from that moment on work for the government. Then this means that
              | between '59 and '68 there was space for certain things which still remained, from
              | before the revolution, from what was the life before. But little by little that was over
              | with. ... I was born in Hijas de Galicia, and in this clinic, the doctor who was supposed
              | to take care of me who was there all the time ... this doctor who my mama my family
              | has paid that he attends me when my mama was going to deliver me, he could not
              | attend me, because they had sent him to work in agriculture. It was not some sort of
              | punishment or anything like that, it was because, it was the time when they said that
              | everybody had to do work of the common man. So then when they put a doctor into
              | agriculture of course when the doctor arrived, he said to my mama, look I arrived, I
              | am in the city but I cannot attend you because two days ago I was on the fields and
              | my nails are full of dirt. A doctor cannot attend in a delivery with nails full of dirt; with
              | all the washing of my hands I still have the dirt there." [25]
              | Nina's memories of her birth and of the early years of the revolution are inherited
              | memories. This indicates her Cuban identity has been constructed, in part, from
              | accounts of Cuba told to her by relatives and learned through historical accounts.
              | This continues in her memories of her childhood home in Havana.
              | "I lived in the center of Havana in a street called Amistad which is right next to the
              | capital. Havana has a capitol looking like the capitol in Washington; they made it very
              | similar. Well I lived four blocks away from that. And that was the house of the family
              | of my father's side. The 10 brothers and sisters my grandmother had they were there
              | in that house. But my whole family all the brothers and sisters of my grandmother
              | except for herself and another sister came to live in the United States when the
              | revolution began ... It was one of these houses in Havana or like in Mexico too which
              | have all the rooms one after another, which have a central patio and all the rooms
              | one after another. For me this was a very big house ... because the only ones who
              | lived there were my papa, my mama, and ... it was like a ghost house you could hear
              | many sounds ... I was raised ... in that house. I never liked the house. I liked it
              | because it was my house, but always, when I look back it has an aura of a house
              | where everybody was left, because all the rooms stayed the same, all the furniture
              | stayed the same ... and it seemed like the people were still there. With time, the
              | things were taken down, they were changed. The things of the rooms were given to
              | other needy families or other members of the family, but in the beginning the house
              | was like when they left, identical, the only thing was that they did not live there
              | anymore." [26]

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | Although Nina expresses both being drawn to and fear of her childhood home,
              | she recalls the city of Havana with great affection and nostalgia. As she
              | described it, "I know Havana where I can walk with closed eyes." Nina's father
              | taught at night, and she and her mother spent many evenings walking through
              | the city. Nina says of that time,
              | "The city had still that soul of a beautiful city. In that moment I didn't realize it,
              | because for me it was a normal city, but there was certain things that you still could
              | see like the places where you got in, the lobbies with marble floors. Then these things
              | started to get destroyed because the time is horrible, and if you don't maintain it ..." [27]
              | Nina's story reflects both the loss of the city she loves and the loss of that city's
              | former glory as a result of the revolution. [28]
              | Nina's parents divorced during her childhood, and she remained very close to her
              | father. When he decided to leave Cuba, the family kept the decision a secret for
              | his protection. As a result, Nina experienced the shock of sudden separation
              | when she learned he was gone.
              | "In ... 1980, my father left. My father that I loved left the country in the year 1980 with
              | the Mariel boatlift ... My dad and my mom had divorced a year earlier. I didn't live with
              | him, but I was very attached to him. The circumstances of the day in which my father
              | left were horrible. My father didn't tell anybody but only ... his mom and his father that
              | he was leaving. He didn't tell me that he was leaving the country. So imagine, I go
              | that afternoon to see my grandmother, and then I arrived to the house and my father
              | is there. And I asked papi, what are you doing here? Well, a day of work, how
              | curious. And I sit with my father to talk with him. At that time I miss him more
              | because I don't live with him, but I continue see him. So I see that papi gives me
              | many kisses and he is rare, rare. And I thought, what is going on with him? We sat in
              | a sofa, and I told him, papi you are giving me a kiss like if you would never see me
              | again. In that time the country is in convulsion...with all people who want leave and
              | others who don't. Papi has all this situation with me of kiss and kiss because...he
              | knows that he is leaving, but I don't know. ... So Monday ... morning, my maternal
              | grandmother starts to say your father left the country, your father left ..." [29]
              | Clearly, the departure of her father was painful for Nina. Her own decision to
              | leave Cuba was also emotional, though it was anger which prompted her resolve.
              | She told us she "didn't want to leave Cuba." At the same time, however, Nina was
              | growing increasingly frustrated over her deteriorating quality of life. Her boyfriend
              | predicted that economic hardship would increase with the coming of perestroika
              | in Russia, and he encouraged Nina to take advantage of the opportunity she had
              | to join her father in Florida. In fact, Nina was able to leave because her father had
              | gained citizenship in the United States while she was still a minor: "I decide to
              | leave in September of '89. The summer of '89 was very sad, very sad, very sad,
              | because, imagine, you separate from everything. Curiously, instead of being sad,
              | what I had inside was ...a big anger that I had to leave my country. A very
              | aggressive thing, I took everything in a very aggressive way." Similar to Victor,
              | Nina speaks of having to leave her country. Nina made the decision to leave, with

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | the encouragement of her boyfriend, who saw her growing desperation and
              | unhappiness in Cuba. However, she still perceives herself as having been forced
              | to leave. [30]
              | Nina originally thought of Miami as "horrible." However, her appreciation for the
              | city grew when she traveled to Spain to reunite with her boyfriend. "When I am in
              | Spain I miss Miami, I start to see Miami with other eyes." In addition, due to the
              | large Cuban community in South Florida, Nina saw little need to speak English
              | and acculturate. [31]
              | While Nina eventually became a United States citizen, this legal status has not
              | altered her sense of Cuban identity. According to Nina, being Cuban is an
              | unconscious phenomenon:
              | "Every day, I don't question myself if I am a Cuban because that is what I am. I mean,
              | I wake up in the morning and I drink Cuban coffee, I eat Cuban food. Everything what
              | I do is Cuban, but it is not a conscientious thing." [32]
              | In spite of her new citizenship, Nina does not think of herself as American:
              | "I behave always, respecting the way of living of the Americans. ... We have their
              | laws, we do everything we have to do, but in our private life we are Cuban. I try not to,
              | that my Cuban part doesn't die." [33]
              | In her interview, Nina made a distinction between Cubans who emigrated from
              | Cuba and Cuban Americans who were born in the United States to Cuban
              | parents. In other words, she does not understand those born in the United States
              | to be full Cubans, in spite of their Cuban ethnicity. She reserves Cuban identity
              | for those born on the island. [34]
              | 3.1.4 Daniel's story
              | When Daniel was 7, he came to the United States in the Mariel boatlift with his
              | parents. He remembers aspects of Cuban life under Castro, such as the
              | nationalism expressed at his school. Daniel does not have direct memories of his
              | migration. Most of Daniel's memories have been constructed with information
              | received from relatives and other sources. He repeats what might be considered
              | the standard discourse of the exile community. For example:
              | "I came to this country when I was only about seven years old, so I don't have a lot of
              | memories, very distinctive memories. I do know I didn't have a lot of abundance. I
              | was raised in a land that once flourished in the 1950s. However, when I was born in
              | the 1972 post-Castro era, there started to be more scarcity and less freedoms as far
              | as freedom of speech and so forth." [35]
              | The most prominent feature of Daniel's memories of Cuba is his father's experi-
              | ence. Daniel was both proud and somewhat defensive about this aspect of his
              | past, because his father worked as a high-level government official under Castro.

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | "My father was a highly intelligent person who had a lot of merits, also an economist
              | and also accountant. He actually ascended up through the ranks. He was
              | appointed ... well I don't want to talk too much about that. Bottom line, he didn't have
              | too much of a say. If you have a lot to offer as far as your intelligence, you have some
              | expertise in particular areas in what the government or Castro appoints, you can't say
              | no regardless of what your family thinks or feels. It would be a lot worse for you, so
              | regardless of personal views, that's the way that works." [36]
              | Daniel relates when discussing his father's difficulties in Cuba that some people
              | "were sent to beat him [his father] up and whatever else, discard him." Daniel
              | said his father's past good conduct led people to protect him and help him to
              | escape the island with his wife and son. He notes, "There is things I don't know
              | still till today, because he wouldn't talk about it." As Daniel recalled the day his
              | family left Cuba, he relived the farewells and emotions: "Everybody cried, and
              | hugs I still feel today and my grandparents, I couldn't breathe." He remembers
              | thinking he was just going on vacation and wondered why his relatives were so
              | sad. Daniel's portrayal of Cuba includes some happy memories of playing with his
              | grandfather in his childhood home, but Cuba seems largely a shadowy place.
              | Both the sense of threat and possible shame darken the playful childhood
              | images. [37]
              | Daniel speaks of his father with great respect and admiration. He frames their
              | immigration experience in the context of his father sacrificing a white collar
              | position in order to give his son "the dream of America, you know the greatest
              | country on earth." Daniel expresses pride in his American citizenship and
              | identifies strongly with the ideal of the American dream. Although he asserts that
              | he is also proud of his "Cuban roots and culture." He identifies South Florida as
              | "home" and throughout the interview embraces the diversity of the region. [38]
              | 3.2 Second generation immigrants
              | Two of the participants, Lisa and Yolanda were born in the United States. They
              | have "Cuban memories" from their parents and grandparents. These second-
              | generation Cuban Americans told us they were acutely aware of the sense of loss
              | felt by their parents. Although the women did not identify with a sense of loss or
              | nostalgia themselves, they assert these forces played a strong presence in their
              | lives. Their sense of belonging reflects attachment to their families rather than to
              | the island of Cuba. At the same time, the women find their families' focus on
              | Cuba oppressive; and they yearn to "migrate" to freedom in their own way. [39]
              | 3.2.1 Lisa's story
              | Lisa was born in 1977. Her mother emigrated from Cuba on a Freedom Flight at
              | age 11 with her parents and younger sister. According to her story, this was a
              | heart-breaking experience for Lisa's grandparents, whose own neighbors threw
              | eggs at them and called them traitors as they left. Lisa told us, "My dad came
              | another way; I don't want to specifically say, but he came another way when he
              | was 25." Later she referred to the fact that her father had been in prison for
              | © 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | opposing the Castro regime. He had escaped and stowed away on a Dutch cargo
              | ship, hiding in a cavity of the ship where ropes were stored. [40]
              | Lisa constructs her Cuban identity through her family:
              | "My memories or my interaction with Cuban culture has just been through them; I've
              | never stepped on Cuba, never seen Cuba ... Whenever I say I'm Cuban, I
              | immediately follow that saying, oh no my parents are Cuban. I was born here. I
              | always do that. ... With me it's ... the hyphenated Cuban-American more ... because
              | the Cuban side is more like I said ... it's more an identity of what my parents gave
              | me." [41]
              | She gives an example how this hyphenated perspective is expressed through
              | food. The family celebrates Thanksgiving with a turkey and yams because it is
              | the traditional American meal. However, to reflect their Cuban heritage, they add
              | a leg of pork. Her strongest impressions of Cuba come through her grandfather,
              | who she refers to as "old school" and who considers Cuba a "sacred land." When
              | she was a little girl, he gave her sugarcane stalks to suck on as a taste of Cuba,
              | and taught her how to kill a chicken. On the other hand, she told us how her
              | mother remembered President Kennedy's assassination, and so her family
              | identifies with certain iconic moments of American history, as well. [42]
              | Lisa does not strongly identify with a Cuban ethnicity nor does she feel a strong
              | connection to Cuban national identity. She comments on the fact that it makes no
              | difference to her whether someone is from Puerto Rico or Cuba or Mexico. She is
              | bemused by the tendency of older Cuban immigrants to feel a bond with her
              | when they learn of her Cuban ancestry.
              | "There's parts of me that feels Cuban or what I think is Cuban. My identity that I know
              | is from my family, and you know just things from the media. It's entertainment; half
              | the time I can't really tell if they're having a Cuban accent or not. To me it's just a
              | Spanish accent ... I can never tell who's Puerto Rican or who's from Mexico ... I'm
              | very bad at that, and when they tell me, I'm like, whatever. I've had a lot of people
              | confuse me for Puerto Rican and I'm like, no I'm Cuban, and they're like, oh I'm so
              | sorry. I'm like, I don't care, whatever. ... I even get it at work a lot of times 'cause
              | where I work there's a lot of Spanish people but from all over. ... They're looking at
              | me because my Spanish is very Americanized, and they ... say, where you from. And
              | then if I say I'm Cuban, and they are Cuban, forget about it ... they start talking to me
              | and they ask me where my parents are from and I'm like, wait a minute. Am I
              | supposed to give you a prize because we are from the same ethnicity? All of the
              | sudden their eyes bloom, and they feel like they have this connection with me. ...
              | Ethnicity wise, I don't see a great connection. Sometimes in the back of my mind
              | someone says I'm Cuban, it's kind of like oh ok, but then it dies ... I don't get that
              | instant connection. I get it, but to me it to me it's not that important." [43]
              | Lisa also differentiated her own sense of ethnicity with the national identity of her
              | father. She noted how she learned of her ancestry from Venezuela, France, and
              | Spain. And even though her father was born to Venezuelan parents who had

              | immigrated to Cuba, he continues to stress his Cuban identity. Lisa contrasts this
              | strong identification with Cuban identity, saying,
              | "I'm just American. It's just the threads of the makeup of my past and my parents'
              | past that make me who I am; it's the mixture of the French and the Spaniard and the
              | Cuban and the Venezuelan and then all of the things that made them, the places they
              | were and the experiences that made them what they are today, and whatever
              | religious things get tied to it and then any cultural things." [44]
              | Lisa is somewhat defensive about the United States when her Cuban relatives
              | criticize it.
              | "The only thing of Cuba I have is through the stories and the rantings of my
              | grandparents and my father. Of course the worst thing you could do at any Cuban
              | gathering is mention the word Cuba, and there's a good three-hour argument. ... I get
              | mad a lot of times because they always compare things from Cuba, but they are
              | comparing things—Cuba 1950s to here—how better it was in Cuba. I always say, if
              | you went back now you wouldn't recognize the place, and I go stop-stop-stop
              | bumming on this country that you've come to." [45]
              | While Lisa identifies with the United States as her homeland, she still refers to it
              | in this excerpt as "this county" and does not feel at home in South Florida: "I don't
              | wanna live here anymore. I don't see myself, I can't see myself here." She
              | aspires to move to Denver with her husband and likens her parents' and
              | grandparents' decision to leave Cuba with her own desire to leave South Florida.
              | "I feel like the black sheep 'cause I want to leave. I live in Broward, and they live in
              | Dade, but I want to move. I want to move up north; I want to move to Denver. That's
              | where me and my husband want to go, and to them it's like I'm destroying the family.
              | I try to tell them, well, wait a minute you immigrated here. But then its like ooh, we
              | were under persecution. I want to take the chance to better myself. I don't see it
              | happening here. ... I gotta figure out what's best for me." [46]
              | 3.2.2 Yolanda's story
              | Like Lisa, Yolanda was born in the United States, but with far less connections to
              | the cultural artifacts of "Cuban-ness." She has empathy for the trauma her father
              | experienced as a Cuban refugee, but she also feels he is in denial about his
              | possibility of returning to the island.
              | "My dad says that he had a good house for the family back in Cuba, but he and my
              | mom and my older brother and sister had to leave everything behind. Castro's regime
              | expropriated the house that belonged to my parents. I think my dad never
              | recuperated from the loss, and he refuses to buy any property in the United States.
              | He only hopes to go back home to his beloved Cuba. I do not feel the same. When
              | Castro dies I will go to Cuba and will visit my aunts, uncles and cousins; but I don't
              | feel as Cubans born in the island feel, like one day they will go back to claim what is
              | theirs. My dad never says it, but I think he is waiting some day to go back and claim

              | his house and the farm he lost over thirty years ago. That is a long time to wait for
              | something that will never be his again ever! The older generation of Cubans...still act
              | and think like refugees ... Many Cubans including my parents and the majority of their
              | friends blame the United States for their long stay in this country. They feel they don't
              | belong in here. Some of them do not speak English, and some others including
              | young people refuse to learn English. For example, if you go to little Havana, you
              | have the impression that you are in another country. People speak and act like if they
              | were in one of the streets from Cuba ... I avoid that area as much as I can. It is too
              | much for me. I like the peace and quiet ... I am stressed ... as it is, I don't need the
              | noisy Cubans." [47]
              | Yolanda repeatedly refers to "Cubans" as a group to which she does not belong.
              | She says even though she is North American, she has to listen to discussions of
              | Cuba because her family is from Cuba. She says she regularly eats Cuban food,
              | but sometimes gets bored and eats sushi.
              | "Don't get me wrong, even though I don't feel like a Cuban I still like Cuban people.
              | Many of my friends are Cuban. I like the food, the parties, the way they enjoy life,
              | their work ethics, and one day I will like to visit Cuba. To anybody that asks me where
              | I am from I always mention my Cuban ancestry; I am very proud of it ... If I have kids
              | in the future I would like to teach them Spanish and talk to them about their Cuban
              | heritage; I think it is important to have roots and a sense of belonging to different
              | cultures." [48]
              | Yolanda simultaneously asserts while she does not feel Cuban, she is nonethe-
              | less proud of her Cuban ancestry. She may not yearn for Cuba as her father
              | does, but she is haunted by unfulfilled dreams of her own. She feels her desires
              | to be a singer and artist have been stifled and prohibited by her father, who she
              | refers to several times as a very strict "Cuban father." At the time of the interview,
              | she was living with her parents in an apartment, but expressed hopes of
              | establishing a home of her own at some point outside of Miami-Dade County. [49]
              | As these interviews highlight, our informants' notions of Cuban identity and home
              | reflect complex and divergent perspectives. These biographers from both the first
              | and second generations convey multiple aspects of what it means to be Cuban in
              | America. A common thread among these interviews, however, is the lived
              | experience of ambivalent belonging. It is this theme we explore more fully below.
              | When summing up our results concerning the sense of belonging to a Cuban
              | identity, we found the second generation did not express a strong national or
              | ethnic Cuban identity. Perhaps the young women who were interviewed for our
              | study are simply too far removed in time from the revolution that took place 50
              | years ago to feel an emotional connection to the trauma of separation from the
              | Cuban nation. They told us they feel American. The women also appear to be
              | conflicted about the degree of Cuban-ness they feel or want to embrace. They
              | embrace the notion of the American dream, and often feel their Cuban parents
              | are preventing the fulfillment of those dreams. Their Cuban identity consists
              | largely of symbolic ethnicity expressed in food and music. The women speak
              | Spanish, but confess it is "Americanized." Although he was born in Cuba, Daniel,

              | who came to the United States at age seven, also conveys a strong sense of
              | American identity, placing him in between the first and second generation. In
              | spite of the differing emphasis placed on identity and what it means to be Cuban,
              | Daniel and the second generation immigrants all express pride in their Cuban
              | heritage and a desire for their own children to learn Spanish and to be connected
              | to the culture of their past. Clearly, there is no single Cuban identity; rather,
              | individuals subjectively construct and experience multiple, evolving notions of
              | Cuban identity. We explore this notion more fully below. [50]

              | 4.1 Ambivalence regarding leaving
              | CHAITIN, LINSTROTH, and HILLER's introductory article in this issue, which
              | provides an overview of the larger study from which our sub-sample was drawn,
              | notes the experience of immigration is often accompanied by stress and a sense
              | of contradiction and ambiguity. This is due to the opportunities afforded by
              | immigration combined with estrangement from the homeland. [51]
              | One dominant theory of migration relies on this notion of duality in the
              | immigration experience by using a push and pull model to explain why migrants
              | leave one country and move to another. This theory suggests "the 'push' of
              | diminishing opportunities and the 'pull' of new ones" function to motivate
              | immigration (PEDRAZA-BAILEY, 1985, p.5). When one considers refugees, the
              | factors contributing to the push to leave may be political as well as economic.
              | MAINGOT (1992) has outlined how such structural forces have affected the push
              | and pull of migration specifically for immigrants from the Caribbean Basin. [52]
              | In the stories of the Cuban immigrants analyzed for this article, we saw evidence
              | of pushing and pulling influences that contributed to their decisions to leave
              | Cuba. We suggest this duality contributed to ambivalence among our participants
              | regarding the phenomenon of leaving. Those who emigrated felt forced to leave
              | their homeland, although they were not literally expelled; this was a choice they
              | made to better their lives. As a result, these first generation immigrants convey
              | the conflicting feelings of loss over leaving a homeland, combined with the desire
              | to leave for a better life. They feel resentment over being "forced" to leave, but
              | they simultaneously feel the conflicting feeling of gratitude over having escaped
              | the oppressive Castro regime. For the second-generation participants, leaving is
              | associated with leaving the immediate family, which is strongly identified with
              | Cuban tradition and the Cuban community. These participants want to escape the
              | oppression of Cuban family expectations, while at the same time they feel the
              | conflicting feeling of valuing close family ties. [53]
              | Based on our analyses, we suggest that the push and pull theory of migration can
              | be expanded beyond consideration of political and economic factors to include
              | psychological and emotional factors. We also suggest the duality of push and pull
              | feelings associated with immigration, which we characterize as ambivalence, are
              | felt long after the decision is made to leave the country. First-generation

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | immigrants continue to feel an emotional push and pull, simultaneous and
              | conflicted feelings about their decision to leave, in some cases for decades
              | following the actual migration experience. Second-generation immigrants remain
              | affected by their parents' experience and their desire to maintain close contact in
              | the aftermath of separation, yet they also yearn to make their own migrations
              | away from what they perceive as a suffocating grip by their parents. [54]
              | 4.2 Ambivalent sense of home
              | CHAITIN, LINSTROTH, and HILLER's article (this issue) points out why notions
              | of home and homeland carry multiple connotations of meanings, identities, and
              | memories; the authors also remark upon the context of immigration, and how the
              | significance of home varies for different generations. We draw upon this
              | recognition and explanation of dialectal and ambiguous aspects of home to
              | consider the sense of home specifically among our Cuban-American biographers.
              | While scholars in the field of Cuban-American studies have pointed to an
              | "American ambivalence" toward the presence of immigrants in American
              | communities, we argue why the immigrants themselves also feel and express
              | ambivalence toward feeling at home in these communities (STEPICK, GRENIER,
              | CASTRO & DUNN, 2003, p.11). [55]
              | Some scholars suggest many Cuban immigrants may no longer intend to return
              | to Cuba even after Castro and this means "the United States is their home, not
              | Cuba" (OLSEN & OLSEN, 1995, p.109). This assertion belies the stories of our
              | first-generation informants, who expressed much more complex and conflicted
              | sentiments regarding what and where home is for them. Whether or not first-
              | generation Cuban immigrants actually expect to return to the island, or will
              | eventually do so, they may consider themselves "reluctant migrants" who
              | continue to view Cuba as home (PEREZ, 1992, p.93). In addition, for those
              | residing in Miami, the large and dominant Cuban presence makes possible a
              | daily existence largely conducted in Spanish among fellow Cuban immigrants.
              | Such an environment might be considered a liminal space—not quite Cuba, not
              | quite the United States. This liminality contributes to ambiguity about home. [56]
              | The perceptions of changes in post-revolutionary Cuba have also fostered a
              | sense of ambivalence about Cuba as home among the first-generation
              | immigrants. There is a belief the Castro revolution destroyed an ideal, beautiful
              | tropical island homeland. While the communist ideology and economic system
              | has transformed the "real" Cuba into a physically damaged and morally decaying
              | country. Of course, this "real" Cuba is an imagined construct, as one of our
              | biographers stated: it exists in the mind only. This finding is reflected by
              | FOURON and GLICK-SCHILLER's assertion (2002, pp.168-169) that immigrants
              | often dream of a "dear, sweet homeland," a fiction non-existent in actual
              | memories. [57]
              | The first-generation immigrants in our sample also expressed the simultaneous,
              | conflicting feelings of ambivalence in regards to the United States as a new
              | home. Their notions of ethnic difference co-exist with an appreciation for freedom

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | of speech and the economic opportunity characterized as the American dream.
              | PORTES and STEPICK (1993, p.149) assert Cuban immigrants developed a
              | relationship to the United States through rejecting the discourse of "minority" and
              | adopting the discourse of the "success story." CASTRO (2000, p.306) suggests
              | their espousal of the success story "fuels Cuban accomplishments; from it flow
              | Cuban-American pride and self-confidence and, too often, anger, arrogance, and
              | intolerance, as well." We believe the discourse of achievement also impacted the
              | sense of home among these immigrants. By identifying with the national
              | mythology of the American dream, they have been able to feel somewhat at
              | home in American culture, while simultaneously feeling as outsiders. [58]
              | It is furthermore important to recall here the role of such structural influences as
              | architecture and Spanish-language street names as described in our socio-
              | historical context of Cuban immigration (PEREZ, 1999). U.S. construction of
              | government and commercial buildings and housing developments in Cuba in the
              | twentieth century, and Cuban-inspired architecture and street names in greater
              | Miami, caused Cuban immigrants to find the Miami environment simultaneously
              | foreign and familiar. This resonance of cultural familiarity may have helped many
              | Cuban immigrants to appreciate living in South Florida and to feel at home. While
              | for most of them, their emotional homeland is the Cuban island. [59]
              | Our results showed why second-generation immigrants' sense of home is
              | conflicted, but in different ways than their parents and grandparents. RUMBAUT
              | (2002) discusses the impact of first-generation immigrants' sense of home and
              | belonging on their children. He asks whether the sense of belonging their parents
              | feel toward the ancestral homeland
              | "are sustained in the generation of their children, particularly those born here who
              | lack the memories and metaphorical birth connection of their emigrant parents.
              | Where is home—or perhaps homes—for the second generation? Do they imagine
              | themselves in multiple sites of belonging? Are they able to lead dual lives or to
              | maintain dual frames of reference? Are they even interested?" (2002, p.46). [60]
              | Other researchers, such as Diane WOLF (1997, p.459), speak of "emotional
              | transnationalism" as a term that captures this sense of attachment to a homeland
              | for second-generation immigrants. She suggests while there may be less of an
              | attachment to the imagined homeland, second-generation immigrants
              | nonetheless understand "home" in a nostalgic way. HERRERA (2007) applies
              | this line of thought specifically to second-generation Cuban immigrants, arguing
              | how these Cuban-Americans know Cuba only through inherited memories. [61]
              | Based on our interviews, however, we found the second-generation Cuban
              | immigrants in our study did not feel personally connected to Cuba as home, and
              | saw Cuba as the homeland of their parents and grandparents, while they, the
              | children, identify with the United States as their own homeland. It may be the
              | inability of second-generation Cuban Americans to travel to the ancestral
              | homeland has prevented the formation of these emotional ties and imagined
              | nostalgia. For second-generation immigrants from other countries, especially

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | those who are able to move back and forth between two countries, such travel
              | may foster a genuine transnationalism. Instead of nostalgia, the second-
              | generation biographers indicated a constant reference to and repetition of Cuban
              | history by first-generation Cubans was somewhat oppressive. They sought
              | distance from the notion of Cuba as home. These participants spoke of their
              | appreciation for their families and for what they have experienced, but at times,
              | they also find life with their families suffocating. They seek to establish
              | independent homes, which will require deviating from family expectations
              | associated with Cuban tradition. [62]
              | 4.3 Ambivalent identity
              | Cuban identity is a topic of extreme importance for the immigrant community in
              | the United States. It is also a contested idea, due in part to the varying
              | experiences of those arriving in the United States during the different waves of
              | migration. As mentioned above, regarding the ideal of Cuba Libre (free Cuba)
              | has existed in the imagination for centuries as an unrealized dream. In light of this
              | unique history, Cuba has been referred to as "the elusive nation" (FERNANDEZ
              | & BETANCOURT, 2000, p.3). Scholars have argued why Cuban-ness itself is
              | associated with "incompleteness, impossibility, loss, and disenchantment"
              | (FERNANDEZ & BETANCOURT, 2000, p.8). DUANY (2000) has pointed to why
              | the perception of Cuban-ness is not American. CASTRO posits how the exile
              | community "believes that it is a repository and trustee of what is most authentic in
              | Cuban culture, which, in its view, has been virtually destroyed on the island by
              | nearly four decades of communism" (2000, p.306). This exile community
              | attempts to pass this Cuban culture on to the second generation, but this
              | construction of Cuban culture and identity does not acknowledge the inevitable
              | changes taking place within every culture. This is a point that MEDINA
              | emphasizes in pointing to the "illusion of uniqueness or singularity" of Cuban
              | identity, an illusion that does not take into account the diversity and contested
              | nature of that national identity (2007, p.3). [63]
              | This sense of loss brings us to the issue of trauma. VOLKAN (1991, p.13) speaks
              | of "chosen trauma" when referring to experiences of victimization and humiliation
              | as factors in the construction of a collective identity. We contend why this
              | conceptualization is useful in understanding various expressions of Cuban
              | identity. The first generation of Cuban immigrants who participated in this study
              | experienced trauma in the process of leaving the island, and specifically convey
              | how suffering is linked to Castro's regime. This trauma remained at the forefront
              | of their construction of their own identities; indeed it was the first thing they
              | mentioned when they began telling the stories of their lives. While it is
              | understandable any trauma would leave a permanent impression in someone's
              | consciousness, these immigrants chose to identify with this political trauma. It
              | appears to be a unifying element of Cuban exiles in South Florida for creating
              | communal identity. The first-generation immigrants chose to maintain this trauma
              | as the central facts of their collective Cuban identity. [64]

              | "My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida
              | Chosen trauma may also carry over from first-generation to second-generation
              | immigrants where "there is an unconscious expectation that the next generation
              | will complete both the task of mourning and the reversal of humiliation" (VOLKAN
              | & ITZKOWITZ, 2000, p.233). The notion of second-generation "remembering,"
              | referred to above, coincides with this idea that those who did not experience the
              | trauma will nonetheless feel traumatized as a result of hearing their parents'
              | stories and memories (HERRERA, 2007). The theory of long distance nationalism
              | supports this notion, proposing "an ideology of belonging that extends across the
              | territorial boundaries of states, as well as across generational divides" (FOURON
              | & GLICK-SCHILLER, 2002, p.170). On the other hand, RUMBAUT (2002, p.91)
              | suggests that the second generation does not experience this trauma "over a
              | homeland that was never lost to them in the first place." Other scholars argue that
              | even if second-generation immigrants seek to maintain a national identity rooted
              | in the ancestral homeland, a lessening of attachment inevitably occurs as a result
              | of the many little acts and decisions of everyday life in the country of residence
              | (KASINITZ, WATERS, MOLLENKOPF & ANIL, 2002). [65]
              | 4.4 Concluding thoughts
              | In the analysis and discussion above, we have focused on several aspects of
              | ambivalence that emerged in the life stories of our Cuban biographers. We have
              | explored differences among first- and second-generation Cuban immigrants
              | regarding what it means to leave or escape, what it means to be Cuban, and
              | where home is found. These findings have led us to consider areas for potential
              | further research and exploration. [66]
              | Based on our interpretations of the biographical interviews with the younger
              | generation, we see initial indications in these interviews alluding to the potential
              | formation of a pan-Hispanic identity. While the older first-generation immigrants
              | identify passionately with Cuba, the country of Cuba is important to the second-
              | generation immigrants only as a place they would like to visit some day in order to
              | meet distant relatives. The second-generation immigrants identify more strongly
              | with the Spanish language and with a general Hispanic ethnicity. What is more
              | this research proves how ethnicity does not necessarily need to reflect a unified
              | identity for such groups as Cuban Americans. Generational differences as those
              | among Cuban Americans explain how ethnic forms of belonging may contradict
              | one another, proving why identity formation is so complex and nuanced for any
              | group. In fact, this may be the beginning of a new construction of a new variation
              | of ambivalent identity and may bear fruit for further research. [67]
