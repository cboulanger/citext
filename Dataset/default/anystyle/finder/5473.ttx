              | Abstract. Parliaments emerged as one of the key political institutions in the post-
              | communist transition. Endowed with the significant power they acquired under
              | the old communist constitutions, they were assigned the task of drafting and rat-
              | ifying the new democratic constitutions in the transition period. Like most oth-
              | er institutions in Central and Eastern Europe, parliaments have undergone im-
              | portant changes in terms of how they function and in relation to their external
              | environment. This article provides an introductory overview of the changing na-
              | ture of parliaments in the region, focusing on two important areas of legislative
              | studies. The first part of the article looks at the role of parliaments in represen-
              | tation. The second part offers several generalisations about the relationship be-
              | tween parliaments and their respective executive branches. By reviewing these
              | two aspects of legislative process, some insights are also provided into the
              | changing internal workings and procedures of CEE parliaments.

              | Introduction
              | Modern democracies are unthinkable without parliaments. Parliament provides the
              | institutional platform for the interaction of intermediary agencies: the parties, in-
              | terest groups, or social movements that link them to society. Parliament also links
              | society with other democratic institutions, the executive, judiciary or state bureau-
              | cracy. In that sense, parliament is the key structure of representation. In every po-
              | litical system the parliament encompasses a wide range of institutions, rules and
              | procedures, and political organisations, and as such it can be viewed as the focal
              | point around which revolve all the crucial questions of political style, legitimacy and
              | democratic accountability. In addition, parliament is multifunctional: it legislates
              | (hence the frequently used reference to ‘the legislature’), i.e. it makes laws. Howev-
              | er, it is also the place where political elites are trained and socialised, where diverse

              | social groups and nationalities of one state are integrated, where national adminis-
              | tration is subjected to an oversight, and where the interests of society interests, and
              | frequently even public policies, are articulated.
              | The parliaments in communist Eastern Europe existed more or less as rubber-
              | stamping bodies. Although no Eastern European communist regime abandoned its
              | parliament, it was so subordinated to the Communist Party apparatus that particu-
              | larly its legislative activities and oversight functions were minimal, at least until the
              | 1980s, when communist leaderships throughout the region began to lose their grip
              | on society [see Nelson and White 1982]. The wave of political change that swept
              | across Eastern Europe in the early 1990s propelled parliaments almost overnight
              | from institutions with very limited autonomy in decision-making into bodies that at
              | least initially became one of the key political players in each country. There were at
              | least two reasons for the pivotal role parliaments acquired. First, parliaments were
              | handed the task of drafting and ratifying the new democratic constitutions. This
              | presented them with an opportunity to cement a strong position for themselves
              | within the emerging political system. Second, parliaments were endowed with sig-
              | nificant powers from the start of the transition, as the previous communist consti-
              | tutions had made parliaments powerful institutions (at least on paper), and it was
              | these same constitutions that established the rules of the game under which the
              | new parliaments began operating in the post-communist era.
              | However, like most other institutions in the region, parliaments have under-
              | gone numerous changes, both in their internal functioning and in relation to their ex-
              | ternal environment. They are clearly not the same institutions they were during and
              | immediately after the uncertain and extraordinary period of transition to democracy
              | (i.e. from 1989 to the mid-1990s). This article provides an introductory overview of
              | the changing nature of parliaments in Central and Eastern Europe1 (CEE), focusing
              | on two important areas of legislative studies. The first part of the article provides a
              | look at the role of parliaments in representation, while the second part presents sev-
              | eral generalisations concerning the relationship between parliament and the execu-
              | tive branch. By reviewing these two aspects of legislative process the final aim is to
              | provide some insights into the changing internal workings and procedures of CEE
              | parliaments. It should be noted that in this article the similarities between CEE par-
              | liaments are emphasised rather their differences. This of course does not mean that
              | there are no differences. CEE parliaments have always differed in many institution-
              | al and behavioural aspects and will continue to do so. However, by placing empha-
              | sis on similarities, the aim is to highlight the increasing degree of convergence be-
              | tween CEE parliaments and the parliaments in established (Western European)
              | democracies.
              | 1 Central and Eastern Europe refers here to all eight new EU member states among the post-
              | communist countries, plus the three Balkan EU-candidate states; e.g. Bulgaria, Romania and
              | Croatia. It thus excludes Russia and most other former Soviet Republics, and several of the
              | Balkan countries.

              | Parliaments and representation
              | Parliaments are the symbols of representation, perhaps more so than anything else.
              | Sometimes they are deliberately set up in such a way as to reflect a society’s socio-
              | cultural diversity. The communist legislatures tried to ensure the equal representa-
              | tion of women, peasants, workers, and national minorities, etc., and created parlia-
              | ments that were supposed to be more or less a mirror of their respective societies.
              | In most contemporary European democracies, it is political parties that are the key
              | agents of representation. Parties select and campaign on behalf of and provide lists
              | of representatives, who when elected sit in parliament and, if in control of a major-
              | ity, also form the government. This is a party government model of representation,
              | in which voters simply delegate their power to the political parties that best repre-
              | sent their political preferences. However, links between parliaments and the elec-
              | torate can also exist, especially in between the elections, through various forms of
              | constituency representation, wherein individual MPs promote the interests of par-
              | ticular geographical areas, sectors of society, or even individual constituents.
              | These different models of representation are not mutually exclusive, and in
              | most political systems they to a large extent co-exist [see Andeweg and Thomassen
              | 2003]. There is usually a set of informal practices that determine which particular
              | form of representation dominates, or what happens if conflicts between various
              | forms of representation arise; for example, if an individual MP is caught between
              | the interests of his or her constituents on the one hand and those of the government
              | on the other. Patterns of representation also depend on a range of formal political
              | institutions, most importantly the kind of electoral system and the nature of politi-
              | cal parties and party systems. In this the CEE parliaments are no exception: the de-
              | velopment of their links to the electorate has been greatly influenced by the nature
              | of post-communist parties, elections and electoral systems. It has also been greatly
              | affected by the particular structure of parliamentary membership.
              | Parties and elections
              | Organised political parties emerged relatively slowly in post-communist CEE. Ow-
              | ing in part to the strong anti-party sentiments among both the population and the
              | new political leaders [see Lewis 2000] and in part to the particularly suppressive na-
              | ture of the communist regimes, the early transition period was dominated by broad-
              | ly based anti-communist movements and umbrella organisations, such as Civic Fo-
              | rum and the Public Against Violence in former Czechoslovakia, the National Salva-
              | tion Front in Romania, Sajudis in Lithuania, and Demos in Slovenia. With a few ex-
              | ceptions, like Bulgaria, it was these movements that also won the first freely con-
              | tested parliamentary elections.
              | Parties began to emerge only as these broad movements started to break up in
              | parliament during their first term in office. In this sense, parliaments performed one
              | very important function in the early stages of post-communist politics: they became

              | the arenas in which new political alliances were forged and new political parties
              | were established. Given that most of the newly established parties were formed
              | from above and consequently lacked solid links with society on the whole, their sur-
              | vival would have been inconceivable without the institutional, logistical and often
              | also financial support that was provided to them by parliaments.
              | However, the rapid and somewhat disorderly process of party formation had
              | negative consequences for the links between parliament and the electorate. Many
              | political parties disappeared during the first parliamentary term and other parties
              | were formed instead. For example, in contrast to the initial eight parliamentary par-
              | ties that were in the Federal Assembly in the former Czechoslovak Federal parlia-
              | ment in 1990, there were no fewer than sixteen parliamentary parties by the end of
              | 1991. In Slovakia, eighteen parties and coalitions registered for the elections in 1994
              | but in fact represented 31 parties and movements. In addition, the composition of
              | parliamentary parties (clubs) frequently changed: members either switched to an-
              | other parliamentary group or became independent. In Slovakia, for example, 44 par-
              | liamentary seats (out of 150) shifted from one parliamentary party to another be-
              | tween the elections of 1990 and 1992; between the 1992 and 1994 elections 28 seats
              | shifted from one party to another [Malová and Krause 2000]. The parties themselves
              | often fractured into several sub-groupings, or disappeared altogether [Gillespie et
              | al. 1995; Kask 1996].
              | The fragmentation of parties and the party system caused a good deal of con-
              | fusion among voters and effectively prevented the formation of stable ties between
              | the representatives and the represented. However, it also affected the internal func-
              | tioning of parliaments because in the wake of such instability parliamentary party
              | leaders had to struggle to impose the party line on parliamentary party members.
              | Consequently, individual MPs introduced their own legislation, often against the
              | wishes of their party or the government coalition they represented, more frequent-
              | ly than they tend to in the established parliaments of Western Europe.
              | The links between parliament and the electorate are also shaped by the elec-
              | toral system. The system of proportional representation (PR) based on party lists
              | combined with large constituencies generally favours representation by parties
              | rather than the emergence of strong links between individual MPs and their con-
              | stituencies. In contrast, the majority system with single-member districts, such as
              | the British first-past-the post, is more favourable to the formation of such links. The
              | countries of Central and Eastern Europe have various electoral systems, but most
              | have adopted, for elections to the lower house, either a PR electoral system (e.g. Bul-
              | garia, Croatia, Czech Republic) or a mixed electoral system, where a part of the
              | house is elected on the basis of a PR system and a part in single-member con-
              | stituencies (e.g. Hungary, Lithuania).
              | However, the key problem with electoral systems in the region has always been
              | the relatively frequent changes they have experienced. Manipulation of the electoral
              | system has been most visible in connection with establishing the legal thresholds for
              | entering parliament [see Shevtsova 1999]. For example, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland

              | all raised these barriers during the 1990s in order to reduce the number of parties in
              | parliament. The Czech Republic has done so for coalitions of parties. The result of
              | these changes has been a reduction in the number of (parliamentary) parties, which
              | is certainly a positive development given the scale of party fragmentation that exist-
              | ed in some countries, such as Poland. However, other effects of this electoral engi-
              | neering are somewhat more questionable, for example, the large proportion of votes
              | ‘wasted’ on the small parties that did not make it into parliament. Most importantly,
              | frequent tinkering with the electoral rules, for instance changing the size of electoral
              | districts, or making changes in how preferential votes count, has also made it diffi-
              | cult for MPs to form links between themselves and their local constituencies.
              | Nevertheless, certain patterns are now emerging across the region as parties
              | and party systems have relatively stabilised and as the institutional framework of
              | the new democracies has become more and more settled. Parliamentarians are now
              | primarily anchored in their political parties, not least because MPs now owe their
              | career to the party rather than to their own personal qualities and personalities. Vot-
              | ers also note vote primarily for a political party rather than a particular individual.
              | Parties are therefore slowly emerging as the key agencies of representation, as they
              | are in most countries in Western Europe. Although the various forms of con-
              | stituency representation tend to be relatively underdeveloped in the region, re-
              | search in this area also suggests that some form of territorial and sectoral represen-
              | tation is becoming part of MPs’ working routines, for example, in Slovakia [Malová
              | and Siváková 1996] and Poland [van der Meer Krok-Paszkowska 2000] and other
              | countries that use the mixed electoral systems [see Birch 2001].
              | Members
              | Many of the deputies that were in the first post-communist parliaments in CEE
              | came from the ranks of the opposition movements that existed in the region. In
              | some parliaments these movements won a majority after the first free elections (e.g.
              | Czechoslovakia, Poland), in other parliaments it was the (ex-)communist parties
              | that dominated (e.g. Bulgaria). The opposition movements themselves were largely
              | composed of intellectual elites, independent professionals and artists, who had con-
              | stituted the backbone of anti-communist dissent. As a result, the early parliaments,
              | especially those in which the opposition was victorious, managed to acquire legiti-
              | macy in the eyes of the population, as former dissidents replaced the communist-
              | era deputies and apparatchiks. In some cases, like in the former Czechoslovakia, the
              | replacement process actually occurred before the first democratic elections, as a re-
              | sult of agreements between the outgoing communist regime and the opposition dur-
              | ing round table negotiations after the Velvet Revolution. The Federal Assembly and
              | the Czech and Slovak National Councils purged themselves, and between one-third
              | and one-half of the MPs in the federal and national councils were replaced by can-
              | didates supported by the anti-communist opposition.

              | However, the gains in terms of democratic legitimacy were offset by the inex-
              | perience of these new members in operating in a large organisation. Moreover, for-
              | mer dissidents were elected alongside a sizeable group of prominent actors and mu-
              | sicians, and their presence lent the electoral lists of newly formed and largely un-
              | known parties extra visibility and popularity. Although dissidents and artists often
              | displayed convincing rhetorical skill in parliamentary debates, they nonetheless had
              | poor organisational skills, and the loyalty they had to organisations like parliamen-
              | tary parties or parliamentary committees was weak. Ironically, it was the MPs of the
              | (ex-)communist parties that often turned out to be the more effective parliamentar-
              | ians, as they had already learned the necessary skills of negotiation, deal-making
              | and constituency representation under the previous regime.
              | Consequently, the composition of the first democratic parliaments partly con-
              | tributed to the comparatively high turnover of MPs that has occurred since then.
              | Each successive parliament in the region has been largely comprised of different
              | MPs, which undermines the ability of MPs over the long term to specialise in spe-
              | cific areas or issues and hinders legislative continuity and stability. Many of the for-
              | mer dissidents and the majority of artists did not view their position as MPs in
              | terms of a life-long career, and they consequently did not even seek re-election.
              | Moreover, the organisational instability of political parties and the relatively high
              | level of electoral volatility has meant that incumbency rates among the CEE parlia-
              | mentarians have remained relatively low, though perhaps not as low as in the early
              | years of post-communist transformation.
              | For the most part there are no quotas pertaining to the representation of par-
              | ticular sectors of society in the new parliaments of the region. There are, however,
              | several exceptions, as Poland, Hungary and Romania have introduced measures
              | aimed at either guaranteeing or encouraging the representation of their ethnic mi-
              | nority groups [see Juberías 1998]. In comparison with the communist period the
              | representation of women has suffered, but the number of female MPs in parliament
              | is not uniformly low throughout all the CEE countries when compared to the Euro-
              | pean average. In June 2002, in the countries of Europe, including the Scandinavian
              | states, the average percentage of women in both houses of parliament was 16.7%
              | (see www.ipu.org). In the CEE countries, also in June 2002, this figure was exceeded
              | significantly by Bulgaria (26.25%), Poland (21.62%) and Croatia (20.53%), and
              | matched by both Latvia (17%) and Estonia (17.82%). However, both Hungary (9.07%)
              | and Lithuania (10.64%) were well below the European average.
              | In CEE countries generally the position of MP is acquiring the attributes of po-
              | litical professionalism. The shift towards professional MPs and politicians has been
              | furthered by significant increases in the salaries of MPs, the introduction of travel
              | and accommodation allowances, and by a general improvement in their working
              | conditions, for instance, with the creation of new parliamentary buildings. Croatia
              | is a good example of dramatic developments, as the position of MP was given pro-
              | fessional full-time status, accompanied by a full salary, in 1992, shortly before the
              | elections to the second post-communist parliament. Until then, MPs had only been
              | entitled to per diem payments and other small reimbursements of costs. These

              | changes mean that being an MP is now a lucrative job, which makes parliamentar-
              | ians more dependent on their party organisations and also less likely to defect from
              | the party or even to vote against it. In addition, professionalism empowers parlia-
              | mentarians in the region to perform their representative duties on a more consistent
              | and solid basis. It improves the conditions for serving both the sectarian interests of
              | various social, religious, professional and sectoral organisations, and the territorial
              | interests of an MP’s constituency.
              | Finally, the institutional context in which individual MPs operate has been
              | consolidated and is now fixed. It is more difficult now for an MP to leave a party
              | and/or to set up a completely new party. In Hungary, for example, the number of
              | MPs required to form a parliamentary party and thus also to receive a financial sub-
              | sidy and other administrative support from the parliamentary budget was raised
              | from ten to fifteen in recent years [Ilonszki 2000]. Similar measures have been in-
              | troduced in the Czech Republic, where parliamentary parties newly formed during
              | the legislative term do not moreover receive any financial subsidy from the parlia-
              | mentary budget [Kopecký 2001]. In the Polish Sejm – the parliament perhaps most
              | notorious for party fragmentation – the minimum number of MPs required to form
              | a parliamentary party (klub) has also been increased, from the initial three to fifteen.
              | It was in Poland also that during the second legislative term several MPs from every
              | parliamentary party but one were expelled for breaking with voting discipline [van
              | der Meer Krok-Paszkowska 2000]. Indeed, expulsions of MPs have occurred in all
              | countries in the region, and this indicates that parliamentary parties and their lead-
              | erships have obtained at least some leverage to control the behaviour of their mem-
              | bers. The picture of flux and instability that dominated in most accounts of the first
              | democratic parliaments in the region [e.g. Remington 1994; Ágh 1994; Longley and
              | Zajc 1998] has now given way to accounts that stress the emergence of distinct par-
              | liamentary cultures, settled institutional structures and established parliamentary
              | routines.
              | Executive-legislative relations
              | As in the relationship between parliament and the electorate, formal rules largely
              | shape the development of executive-legislative relations. Interestingly, the dominant
              | model of executive-legislative relations in the CEE region is the parliamentary sys-
              | tem of government with a weak formal president (head of state) and a government
              | that is dependent on legislative confidence. This development is opposite that in
              | most Latin American countries and many of the post-Soviet republics. Indeed, in
              | the CEE context Romania is an exception as a country with a semi-presidential sys-
              | tem of government, in which the head of state possesses significant powers vis-à-vis
              | both the government and parliament. Several other countries in the region, like
              | Poland and Croatia, also initially adopted a semi-presidential system, modelled on
              | the French Fifth Republic, but eventually introduced constitutional reforms (Poland
              | in 1997 and Croatia in 2000) to create a parliamentary system of government.

              | It can generally be claimed that CEE parliaments enjoyed significant advan-
              | tages over their respective governments in the early years of transition. This made
              | legislatures appear stronger and more powerful in the matrix of executive-legislative
              | relations than the legislatures of the established parliamentary democracies of
              | Western Europe were. First, the parties that formed governing coalitions in the re-
              | gion were seldom able to achieve or impose party loyalty among their MPs. In ad-
              | dition, owing to strong political polarisation, coalition partners often quarrelled
              | with each other, sometimes to such an extent that part of the government voted with
              | the opposition in parliament. In some countries, such as the Czech Republic (to
              | 1996) or Hungary, this did not lead to any significant governmental instability, but
              | perhaps only because the parties in the opposition suffered even more from splits
              | and flux than the parties in the government. However, in countries like Estonia,
              | Latvia, and Poland, during the first post-communist decade the governments lasted
              | on average less than one year, a figure well below the European average of 1.9 years
              | [Blondel and Müller-Rommel 2001].
              | Second, the frequent domestic conflicts between the governments (prime min-
              | isters) and presidents in the CEE countries undermined executive cohesion. The
              | highly charged relationship between the former Polish president Lech Walesa and
              | several of the Polish governments between 1990 and 1995 is a good example [see
              | van der Meer Krok-Paskowska 2000]. Arguably, these conflicts sent the Polish po-
              | litical elite back to the drawing board to alter the ‘Little Constitution’ so as to sub-
              | stantially curb the powers of the president. Disagreements over political issues, per-
              | sonnel questions and executive powers were also behind the destabilising conflicts
              | that existed between, respectively, presidents and prime ministers Zhelev and Dim-
              | itrov in Bulgaria, Illiescu and Roman in Romania, and Göncz and Antall in Hungary
              | during the first half of the 1990s [e.g. Baylis 1996]. The conflict between the former
              | president Kováč and the former prime minister Mečiar in Slovakia between 1994
              | and 1998 led not only to changes in the constitutional framework, but even result-
              | ed in the government being implicated in the kidnapping of president’s son
              | [Kopecký 2001]. Parliaments of course benefited most from these conflicts, because
              | in the absence of cohesive executive leadership they were less vulnerable to de-
              | mands to cede powers to either presidents or governments.
              | Third, largely as a result of the communist legacy, the executive was not in a po-
              | sition to exercise effective authority in the political system [Goetz and Wollmann
              | 2001]. The communist regimes established or often just extended the tradition of hav-
              | ing a strong executive, with power concentrated in the hands of a small ruling elite.
              | However, they also created (or continued) a system of government that comprised a
              | massive network of bureaucracies, agencies and planning bureaus. Under commu-
              | nism, the chief task of the central bodies of government was to implement and ad-
              | minister policies that had been decided elsewhere. As a result, the post-communist
              | executive was institutionally fragmented. The structures of central government had
              | been subordinate to the parallel Communist Party apparatus under the previous
              | regime and they were therefore poorly equipped to take the lead in government deci-
meta          | 368
text          | Petr Kopecký: Parliaments in Central and Eastern Europe
              | sion-making in the new regimes. In addition, state administrative personnel, heavily
              | politicised by the previous regime, were not capable of providing the executive with
              | sufficient support to draft and implement policies. Unfortunately, the administrative
              | resources that parliaments as a whole and the individual MPs in particular had to
              | draw on were no larger or better than those of the executive [Olson 1997].
              | This means not only that the governments or presidents were initially unable
              | to create and maintain the executive dominance that is typical for the established
              | democracies of Western Europe, but also that the overall quality of legislation has
              | been poor, as is evident from the frequent amendments and changes to existing
              | laws that characterises the legislative process in the region. The quality of the legis-
              | lation was of course also not helped by the fact parliaments in the region were ini-
              | tially confronted with an enormous amount of legislation that they were required to
              | process within a short period of time.
              | The civil service in CEE countries is still considerably politicised [Grzymala-
              | Busse 2003]. Nevertheless, the position of governments has generally improved
              | throughout the region, to the extent where the balance of power between the exec-
              | utive and the legislature increasingly favours the former. Several elements have
              | been involved in this shift. First, as mentioned above, parties and party systems are
              | much more stable than they were in the early years of transition. This has enabled
              | political leaders to better organise the relationship between the executive and leg-
              | islative branches and to impose some party discipline and cohesion [Ágh 1995; Ma-
              | lová and Siváková 1996]. The internal organisation of parliament has therefore also
              | become gradually more stable, especially given the fact that parliamentary party
              | clubs themselves dominate the party as a whole. Political party leadership often
              | consists of a large group of members of the parliament, which means that conflicts
              | between the parliamentary party faction and the external party are often less visi-
              | ble or less existent than in many established democracies.
              | The second key element in the changing balance of power between executives
              | and legislative assemblies in the region has been the formation of the core execu-
              | tive, centred on the head of government. Reform of central government and state
              | administration has been carried out to varying degrees in almost all the countries of
              | the region. Its refashioning has enabled the executive to extend and consolidate its
              | position around powerful institutions, most notably the council of ministers and the
              | minister of finance [Goetz and Wollman 2001]. These changes at the executive lev-
              | el have certainly not led to the disempowerment of legislatures, which continue to
              | wield at least some oversight authority over the executive branch. However, the in-
              | stitutional resources that are now at the disposal of the executives tend to outweigh
              | the resources of the legislatures.
              | Finally, the balance of power between the executives and the legislative as-
              | semblies has been greatly affected by the processes of European integration. Most
              | countries in the CEE region sought speedy accession to the EU. Eight post-commu-
              | nist countries joined in May 2004, while others, most notably Romania, Bulgaria and
              | Croatia, are likely to join in or shortly after 2007. Preparing for accession to the EU

              | is, politically and administratively, a very lengthy and complicated process, which
              | requires candidate states to comply with a host of conditions specified by the Euro-
              | pean Commission (the so-called Copenhagen criteria of 1993). EU membership is
              | conditional on the adoption of the body of EU laws contained in the acquis commu-
              | nautaire.
              | This process had a significant impact on governance in CEE countries in gen-
              | eral and on the reform of central administration in particular [Grabbe 2001]. For ex-
              | ample, the EU demanded that candidate states implement reform to create a politi-
              | cally neutral civil service capable of both effectively transposing the acquis commu-
              | nautaire and providing efficient support for a democratically elected government
              | [e.g. Verheijen 1999]. It is of course still too early to assess how well these reforms,
              | now in effect in all the new EU member states, succeeded in achieving their objec-
              | tives, particularly that of empowering the core executive. However, it is interesting
              | to note, for example, that pressures to meet the demands from the EU has already
              | led to the professionalisation of central administration in key policy areas, and this
              | in turn has created ‘islands of excellence’ within the civil service [Goetz 2001].
              | The position of the executive in the region has moreover been significantly
              | strengthened vis-à-vis the parliaments by the introduction of fast-track legislative
              | procedures. This relates again to the transposition of the acquis communautaire and
              | its 9000 items of legislation. It would be inconceivable for such a vast number of
              | laws to be adopted through normal legislative procedures, especially those inherit-
              | ed from the communist past. The CEE countries that sought or are still seeking EU
              | membership had to amend their rules of procedure (i.e. standing orders) and treat
              | (some) EU-related laws as a legislative priority (Bulgaria), or even call extraordinary
              | parliamentary sessions to speed up the process (Slovenia). In addition, the man-
              | agement of EU accession was itself highly centralised and it concentrated all re-
              | sponsibilities in the hands of the governments [Lippert, Umbach and Wessels 2001].
              | Taken together, it is not surprising that these procedures and processes privileged
              | the executive branch and consequently reduced the independent policy-making ca-
              | pacity of parliaments.
              | Conclusion
              | The first post-communist parliaments experienced numerous problems that typi-
              | cally affect institutions in transition societies. They initially had to function under a
              | provisional or highly disputed constitutional framework. They were constrained in
              | their actions by their own as yet unsettled internal procedures, by the presence of
              | inexperienced MPs, and by the fragmentary character of parliamentary parties at
              | the time. They were also under significantly less external control from established
              | political parties and powerful interest groups and less influenced by strong execu-
              | tives, as these institutions were still underdeveloped or in the process of transition.
              | The bulk of scholarship on the first post-communist parliaments reflected this tran-

text          | Petr Kopecký: Parliaments in Central and Eastern Europe
              | sitory state of affairs in research predominantly on the role of parliaments in the
              | transition to democracy, in the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and in establishing
              | the norms and procedures of new democracy [Remington 1994; Olson and Norton
              | 1996; Ágh and Ilonszki 1996].
              | The contemporary parliaments in Central and Eastern Europe are different.
              | Their internal structures and procedures are more defined and settled. Legislative
              | tasks are performed in an increasingly routine process. The system of parliamentary
              | committees is in place. Large groups of MPs have by now served for one or more
              | parliamentary terms, which together with the generally improved conditions for
              | MPs’ work have contributed to stability and continuity in the legislative process.
              | Parliamentary parties have also become more accepted as the means whereby par-
              | liament and individual MPs organise the legislature’s operations. It is partly as a re-
              | sult of these political developments that legislative studies on contemporary CEE
              | parliaments have come to resemble studies on parliaments in already established
              | democracies [Olson and Crowther 2002]. Indeed, this special issue of the Czech So-
              | ciological Review, focusing on a classic topic of legislative research, is a poignant re-
              | minder of how far legislative scholarship on the region has already become inte-
              | grated in the mainstream of parliamentary research.
