              | Abstract
              | Reforms of the public sector have helped create a more efficient and effective public sector,
              | but also have created a number of problems. Both, the New Public Management and
              | “governance” reforms have contributed to the contemporary problems in governing. These
              | problems have been political to a great extent, reflecting the tendency to emphasize
              | administrative rather than democratic values. Governments have begun to react to the real
              | and perceived problems within the public sector by developing a number of “meta-
              | governance” instruments that can help steer public organizations but which involve less
              | direct command and control. This paper addresses the contemporary governance tasks of
              | restoring political direction and policy coherence while at the same supporting the autonomy
              | of public organizations, and the involvement of policy networks, in governing.
              | Zusammenfassung
              | Die in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten durchgeführten Reformen des öffentlichen Sektors
              | haben zu mehr Effizienz und Effektivität geführt, aber auch eine Reihe von Problemen mit
              | sich gebracht. Der Einzug von Ideen des New Public Management und des „Governance“-
              | Ansatzes hat zu den Problemen des Regierens, wie wir sie heute beobachten können,
              | beigetragen. Diese Probleme sind vor allem politischer Natur, da die Reformen zu einer
              | Überbetonung administrativer gegenüber demokratischen Werten geführt haben. Auf die
              | realen und die wahrgenommenen Probleme haben die Regierungen mit einer Reihe von
              | „Meta-Governance-Instrumenten“ reagiert, die zur Steuerung öffentlicher Verwaltungen
              | beitragen können, aber weniger direkte hierarchische Kontrolle voraussetzen. Dieser Beitrag
              | diskutiert Möglichkeiten, wie die politische Kontrolle über den öffentlichen Sektor und die
              | Kohärenz staatlicher Programme wieder hergestellt und gleichzeitig die Autonomie
              | öffentlicher Organisationen sowie die Einbindung von Policy-Netzwerken gestärkt werden
              | können.

              | Introduction
              | The public sector in most of our countries has undergone significant change during the past
              | several decades. Whether the changes have been described as “reform”, “modernization”,
              | “reinvention”, or whatever, most governments now are vastly different from what they were
              | even a few years ago. These changes have, in general, produced governments that are
              | more efficient and effective. Further, although most of the reforms implemented have been
              | conceived largely within the market model (Peters, 2001) public administration is now also
              | more open to public participation in many countries, and also has been opened to greater
              | participation by lower echelon public employees.
              | The dominant pattern of reform of the public sector over the past several decades has been
              | discussed as the “New Public Management” (Hood, 1991; Christensen and Laegreid, 2001),
              | or simply NPM. The basic idea of NPM has been that government should be made to be
              | more efficient and effective, and that the best way of achieving these goals is to make the
              | public sector perform more like the private sector. One component of these reforms has
              | been to enhance the autonomy of managers and their organizations, with the assumption
              | that if managerial talent were unfettered by internal rules then the public sector would be
              | more efficient (DiIulio, 1994). In addition, this autonomy was to be enhanced by creating
              | numerous autonomous organizations (see Niskanen, 1971) such as the “Next Steps
              | Agencies” in the United Kingdom.
              | Although the participatory dimension of change may have been discussed sotto voce in
              | many reform processes, it has become a more central conception of reform. In particular,
              | while many of the initial stages of reform were discussed as the New Public Management,1
              | the increased interest in “governance” styles of reform has enhanced the participatory
              | dimension of change (Peters, 2005). Like the idea of the New Public Management
              | “governance” as a concept can be extremely vague (see Pierre and Peters, 2000), and has
              | been the subject of significant academic contestation. That having been said, most of the
              | “governance-style reforms” implemented by governments have emphasized the role of social
              | actors in making and implementing policy, and especially emphasized the role of networks
              | and analogous structures in the processes of governing societies.
              | While both the New Public Management and governance styles of reform have made
              | significant contributions to the performance of the public sector, they have also created a
              | number of significant problems within government. In particular, both styles of reform have
              | tended to create problems of incoherence and poor coordination in the public sector (see
              | 1 This term was, and is, extremely broad and to some extent included participatory ideas as well as the market
              | based efficiency concepts. See Hood (1991).
              | 2 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H S
              | Bakvis and Juillet, 2004) and, in addition, those reforms have created extensive
              | accountability problems (Mulgan, 2000). Therefore, like almost every other reform initiative
              | before them, both NPM and governance reforms have engendered a host of new reforms,
              | and the process of attempting to “make government work better and cost less” continues
              | unabated.2 Very much like Herbert Simon famously argued approximately 60 years ago,
              | most of the adages used in public management (and indeed private management) have
              | opposites that are in the right circumstances equally valid.
              | Given the above discussion, we are dealing with several alternative futures for the public
              | sector in most industrialized democracies. Both of these futures will involve change, and
              | both will require continuing investment of political capital in order to be effective. Further, the
              | central feature of these two futures is that one need not make a definitive choice between
              | them. Both are feasible, and their effects will be complementary. The central political
              | question is not so much one of making a choice between the two, but rather finding a way of
              | making the two fit together in an effective, and democratic, manner.
              | 1. One Future – Continuing the Current Patterns of Reform
              | Although I have been discussing them as alternative models of the public sector, as indeed
              | they are, the patterns of reform that have shaped contemporary government have a number
              | of things in common. Phrased in the most general manner, these reforms have tended to
              | move the process of governing out of the center of government. These reforms have
              | involved a number of different changes in patterns of governing, including:
              | 1) Deconcentration. One of the most important changes associated with the New
              | Public Management has been creating a number of new autonomous or quasi-
              | autonomous organizations – often referred to as agencies (Pollitt and Talbot, 2004;
              | Verhoest, Rubecksen and Humphreys, 2007). A good deal of policymaking and
              | implementation in contemporary political systems has been delegated to these
              | organizations, under the assumption that single-purpose organizations with
              | managerial autonomy will allow skilled public managers to improve the quality of
              | public services. This deconcentration also represents some denigration of politics
              | and politicians in the process of governance.
              | 2) Decentralization. As well as moving some of the functions of the public sector
              | out to devolved organizations within central government, another strategy has
              | been to decentralize activities and give greater responsibility to sub-national
              | 2 This phrase was, of course, the sub-title of the National Performance Review (Gore Commission) in the United
              | States but came to represent a general ambition for reformers in the public sector.
              | I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 3
              | governments. The logic of decentralization is in part to improve efficiency, given an
              | assumption that smaller units will provide services better. Also, decentralization can
              | be justified on democratic grounds, with the public having perhaps greater
              | opportunity for involvement at lower levels of governing.
              | 3) Delegation. A final strategy for reforming the State has been to delegate public
              | authority to a variety of other actors (for general models see Huber and Shipan,
              | 2002). In the market approach to governing much of that delegation has been to
              | contractors and to other market actors. In the governance model much of the
              | delegation would be to networks and to not-for-profit organizations. Both types of
              | delegation can be thought to improve the efficiency of the public sector, and the
              | use of networks of social actors also generally is argued to be important for
              | enhancing the democratic element of governing.
              | We might be able to add to this list of descriptions of change, but taken together all
              | the reforms mentioned here involve “decentering” the governing process (see also
              | Peters, 2004). Although obviously different in terms of their details, and in terms of
              | their justifications, the impact of all of the changes in the public sector has been to
              | minimize control from the center of government – presidents, prime ministers and
              | even individual ministers.3 Thus, they all have at their heart an assumption (explicit
              | or implicit) that government will work better if the political center is devalued, and if
              | public administrators and private sector actors are more responsible for delivering
              | services.
              | 2. From Reform to New Problems Created by Reform
              | The above changes in the public are often justified by the familiar “steering not rowing” logic
              | (Osborne and Gaebler, 1991), assuming that governments are better at setting directions for
              | policy than they are at actually delivering those policies. In reality, however, these reforms
              | may also have reduced the steering capacity of the public sector, and in particular have
              | reduced the capacity that political officials have enjoyed in the past for exercising control
              | over the policies of their governments. This reduction of the “primacy of politics”,4 has in turn
              | created several governance problems:
              | 3 This argument appears to be in direct contradiction to that usually found in comparative politics that emphasizes
              | the decline of parliamentary and even cabinet government in favor of prime ministerial domination – often incorrectly
              | called the presidentialization of parliamentary regimes (see Von Mettenheim, 1997; Heffernan, 2003). That
              | argument, however, focuses more on the political control of the process within government and changes in media
              | focus rather than on the actual capacity of political executives to control policy.
              | 4 This term has come to be commonly used. For one of the earlier uses see Pollock (1951).
              | 4 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H S
              | 1) Politics and Steering. As already implied, the emphasis on moving activities
              | away from the center of government has reduced the capacity of elected officials to
              | exercise control over these policies, even though in democratic politics we assume
              | that elections are about choosing policy (see Rose, 1974; Caplan, 2007). To the
              | extent that so much of government activity is delegated then political leaders are
              | left with few levers, and often poor quality levers, with which to affect the course of
              | their own governments. Any number of prime ministers have expressed their
              | feelings of impotence in the context of contemporary patterns of governing, but
              | many fewer have actually done anything about attempting to redress that balance
              | (but see below).
              | 2) Coordination. A second difficulty resulting from the decentering of the public
              | sector has been reduced levels of coordination among policies and organizations.
              | The notion of first splitting up large organizations into a number of small
              | organizations, and then giving organizations greater autonomy has been central to
              | reforming, especially the creation of agencies. The numerous organizations
              | operating with increased autonomy has, however, tended to exacerbate the familiar
              | problems of coordination and coherence in the public sector. The proliferation of
              | organizations, in turn, also contributes to the difficulties in exercising political
              | control.
              | 3) Complexity. The larger number of organizations involved in governing, and the
              | multiple ways in which they are linked to the more conventional parts of the public
              | sector, also increase the complexity of governing. While complexity is not per se
              | detrimental, it may counteract some of the efficiency gains generated through
              | management changes. That is, the increased number of veto points in the system,
              | and the difficulty in gaining acceptance at all those points does reduce chances of
              | success. Further, complexity does tend to reduce the transparency of the public
              | system and therefore affects accountability (see below).
              | 4) Capture. By separating public organizations from direct connections to political
              | authority, the decentering reforms tend to make those organizations more
              | vulnerable to capture by other interests. This is a classic problem in the analysis of
              | independent regulatory agencies in the United States and elsewhere, but the logic
              | can be extended to cover a range of other organizations that have been detached
              | from political support. The capture may be by local geographical interests
              | (Whitford, 2002) or by functional interests, but the idea of depoliticizing government
              | tends to lead to other forms of politicization, often of a less desirable sort.
              | 5) Accountability. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the reforms in the public
              | sector have generated major accountability problems. One virtue of the “primacy of
              | politics” is that it identifies clearly a hierarchy of accountability in the public sector,
              | I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 5
              | and also identifies a number of mechanisms for enforcing that accountability. When
              | there are a number of alternative relationships between elected politicians and
              | service provision, and many of the service providers assume that they are meant to
              | act autonomously, then identifying responsibility for actions is difficult.
              | Thus, both from the perspective of democratic theory and from the perspective of policy
              | capacity the reforms associated with the New Public Management approach, as well as
              | those coming from the governance approach, have generated a substantial need for further
              | change. As I will point out below, these changes can not be a simple return to the status quo
              | ante with public sector dominance, although some scholars are arguing for a return to more
              | traditional forms of public management (Olsen, forthcoming). Too much change has occurred
              | and governments have learned too much about alternative mechanisms for delivering
              | services to be able to make a simple return to the bureaucratized, hierarchical model of
              | governing (see Walsh and Stewart, 1992). In part, the changes in the public sector
              | associated with these two reform movements have created substantial improvement in the
              | functioning of the public sector, at least at the more micro-levels.5
              | That having been said, however, the movement away from that style of governing has to
              | some extent been exaggerated, and much of the old system remained in place, if subsumed
              | under the facade of new forms of governing (Schofield, 2001). Further, some scholars are
              | also discussing the return to a Weberian style of governing in many settings, with a
              | perceived need to reinvigorate some of the mechanisms for control and probity that were
              | components of more traditional forms of governing. This is far from just being reactionary, but
              | represents the need to recreate some values that were central to making governments both
              | effective and accountable, and which have not been replaced adequately by the products of
              | reform.
              | Leaving aside the return to a more Weberian style of governing, most of the problems
              | generated by the NPM and “governance” reforms can be encapsulated in the problem of
              | democratic government. Again, if elections are about selecting policy as well as leaders, and
              | if those leaders once elected find that they have less influence over policy than they, and
              | probably their voters, believe is appropriate, then there is a fundamental democratic
              | problem. Even if the elected leaders are able to do some of their steering without the rowing,
              | their level of policy control may not be as great as desired. This loss of control over policies
              | is evident for making policy choices, but is even more apparent given the crucial role that
              | implementation plays in determining the true meaning of policy (Meyers and Vorsanger,
              | 2004).
              | 5 By that I mean that the closer one gets to the actual delivery of services, and especially to the operations of
              | individual organizations, the greater have been the benefits of reform. When more systemic factors in governing are
              | considered, the benefits of the reforms may be negligible and the costs may have outweighed the benefits.

              | 3. The Center Strikes Back
              | Having recognized their own difficulties in exercising control over the public sector, a number
              | of governments have begun to take action to attempt to restore control over the public
              | sector. In some instances this shift in ideas about governing has reflected particular political
              | circumstances, including changes in the political parties controlling the public sector. In other
              | cases the attempt to reimpose greater political control has reflected more fundamental
              | changes in ideas about governing. These changes reacting to the problems created by NPM
              | et al. have not had the generality of either NPM or governance ideas, but they do reflect the
              | perceived need to recapture some of the political steering that has been lost.
              | Some of the attempts to reimpose control over governing have tended to run counter to
              | many of the canons of “good governance”. In particular, when faced with the number of
              | organizations and programs over which they perceive themselves to have little direct control,
              | political leaders have tended to politicize the management of those programs. A number of
              | studies of the public sector in the industrialized democracies (Peters and Pierre, 2004) have
              | shown that political leaders have found themselves in the position of having to take political
              | responsibility for programs that they have little capacity to influence directly, and that this is
              | an extremely uncomfortable position for those leaders. One of the simplest means of
              | attempting to gain such control is to have one’s own people managing the programs, e.g. to
              | move toward higher levels of political appointment. Somewhat paradoxically, the internal
              | deregulation of public employment fostered by NPM has facilitated those appointments.6
              | In addition to politicization, the decentering of the State has tended to engender the
              | identification of scapegoats and denial of responsibility. As noted, political leaders may
              | believe that they are being held responsible without justification, and in turn attempt to shed
              | that responsibility. To some extent the complaint is justified, given that many of the linkages
              | associated with effective responsibility and accountability have been weakened, and many of
              | the levers for control have been eliminated. In fact, even some of the mechanisms being
              | used in an apparent attempt to create responsibility for service provision may, in the end,
              | dilute that responsibility. For example, the increasing use of “czars” for problem areas of
              | public service tend to deflect attention, and potentially accountability, away from the political
              | leaders and in the direction of the “czar”.7
              | 6 It is quite possible that these appointments are perfectly qualified as managers, but it is very clear that there are
              | more political forms of appointment, and that those appointments give the appearance of politicizing the public
              | sector in ways that in many politic systems are unacceptable.
              | 7 The Blair government in the United Kingdom was the most enthusiastic user of czars, for problems such as the
              | railways, several aspects of the National Health Service, and for children’s services, among others. This mechanism
              | enables the Prime Minister or a minister to argue that something has been done, and thereby to (attempt to) escape
              | personal political accountability.
              | I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 7
              | Not all of the reactions to the perceived loss of political control have been as negative as
              | those already discussed. Perhaps most obviously, a number of governments have been
              | attempting to build mechanisms for coordinating the numerous programs and autonomous
              | organizations that have been created. One of the more obvious of these attempts has been
              | the movement of “joined up government” in the United Kingdom, but there have been
              | analogous programs in a number of other countries (Pollitt, 2005; Christensen and Laegreid,
              | 2007; Gregory, 2004). The basic idea has been to attempt to integrate government after it
              | had been disaggregated by previous regimes. In some cases, the attempt was structural, but
              | in others there was a more intellectual thrust of attempting to create more “holistic”
              | government that could provide a relatively seamless web of services (6, Leat, Setzler and
              | Stoker, 2004).
              | To some extent the notion of joining up government, while certainly a valuable contribution to
              | governing, missed some of the crucial elements of the decentering reforms. The attempts to
              | improve coordination were indeed joined up government, and apparently were less
              | interested in joining up the other non-governmental aspects of governing that had become
              | so important. In fairness, attempting to produce integration at that level would be more
              | difficult, and might even be counterproductive, if viewed from rather conventional
              | perspectives of governing. That is, simply attempting to bring the various relationships with
              | social actors into a single format, and/or to reduce autonomy, may eliminate the gains from
              | the previous reforms without necessarily creating commensurate benefits.
              | 4. The Gap
              | The discussion to this point reveals the presence of two distinct formats for contemporary
              | governance. As already noted, these two styles, while distinct, are also to a great extent
              | complementary. One governance style emphasizes the need to improve the quality of
              | service delivery, the management of individual organizations, and the democratization of
              | those services. The reforms associated with both NPM and with “governance” have been
              | successful in a number of cases, but then created the need for the second pattern of
              | change, one that emphasizes the need to coordinate, create greater coherence, and to
              | restore the primacy of politics. Each of these approaches to governing constitutes an
              | important contribution to the capacity to provide better governing, but they are rather
              | different. The major task in governing, therefore, may become to “knit” together the two
              | alternatives.
              | In addition to the practical issues of governing involved, these two approaches to governing
              | represent interesting theoretical concerns. On the one hand, there have been important
              | theoretical developments in the area of “governance” (Sørenson and Torfing, 2000; Klijn and
              | Koopenjan, 2005). As implied above this term has come to mean a number of different
              | 8 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H S
              | things, but perhaps the dominant strand has emphasized the need to consider the process of
              | providing direction to society, and providing public services, as involving actors well beyond
              | those nominally in the public sector. Thus, the “governance” reforms mentioned above
              | address the involvement of a wide range of actors in making and delivering services, and
              | that involvement is reflected a justified in a growing body of social scientific literature.
              | One could argue that the concern with governance is old wine in new bottles given that,
              | especially in Northern European countries, varieties of corporatism and corporate pluralism
              | (Rokkan, 1967) have been in existence for decades, if not centuries. The reality of the
              | involvement of social actors with the public sector has to some extent changed as networks
              | have strengthened. Further, the theory surrounding that involvement of private sector actors
              | has certainly changed. For example, rather than much of the involvement being motivated by
              | the State itself (even in the corporate pluralist model), contemporary modes of “governance”
              | allow for greater autonomy exercised by the social actors, and more autonomous self-
              | organization of the networks that are to provide governance.8
              | While governance theory, and its development of the logic of networks, has made a number
              | of contributions to our understanding of the processes of steering the economy and society,
              | it also has a number of internal problems. One of the most important of these problems has
              | been the assumption of decision-making capacity of networks. The network model appears
              | well-suited for conditions in which the principal actors agree on goals and on means, but
              | paradoxically if there were that level of agreement then there might be no need for the
              | networks in the first instance.9 While the networks are advanced as alternatives to
              | conventional forms of governing, they lack pre-determined decision-rules that both enable
              | decisions to be made in the most difficult of circumstances, and also legitimate those
              | decisions.10
              | In addition to the problem in making decisions at all, the absence of clear decision rules may
              | lead to the decisions being sub-optimal. Much as Fritz Scharpf (1988) argued about
              | decision-making in multi-level governance systems, the need to reach consensus may lead
              | to decisions by the lowest common denominator. If there are multiple constituencies with
              | 8 That having been said, some scholars of governance do note the extent to which the State is crucial for
              | establishing the framework under which the involvement of those actors are granted powers to make and implement
              | policy. Likewise, networks might have little raison d’etre were State authority, even if delegated, available for the
              | implementation of the decisions made. These factors are crucial for the meta-governance arguments presented
              | below.
              | 9 The most obvious case would be epistemic communities in which there is an agreement based on a common
              | professional or scientific body of knowledge (see Adler, 1992).
              | 10 Majority rule in legislatures, for example, permits decisions to be made even in the face of conflict, while the more
              | consensual logic of networks may render such decision-making difficult. Further, as these constitutional decision
              | rules are known in advance, they tend to legitimate those decisions, at least in the procedural sense of the term
              | (Buchanan and Tullock, 1962).
              | I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 9
              | potentially extremely different ideas about policy then the only way to resolve the conflicts
              | may be to find the few points of agreement. The more or less incremental outcomes from
              | that type of decision-making process may please established interests within the networks,
              | but may add little to the capacity for innovation and for major policy change (but see Dente,
              | Bobbio and Spada, 2003). That having been said, assuming that such incremental decisions
              | could be made, implementation would be facilitated because the potential opposition to
              | change would be coopted into the decision.
              | Finally, and most importantly perhaps, the delegation of substantial amounts of authority has
              | led to major problems of democracy. These democratic problems involve not only
              | accountability but also representation – both fundamental democratic values. This is, of
              | course, rather paradoxical given that one of the principal justifications for at least some
              | aspects of delegation has been to enhance public involvement. Despite those good
              | intentions only members of certain groups may be involved in the networks, and especially
              | “potential groups” with low levels of organization may not be represented adequately.
              | These challenges to governance theory mirror very closely the problems faced by
              | governments in the “real world” discussed above. Delegation to networks, contractors, sub-
              | national governments, or whatever other actor may be used to make and implement policy
              | creates agency problems, so that the political principals can not produce effective control
              | (Huber and Shipan, 2002). Whether the problem is phrased in terms of principals and
              | agents, or in terms of more overtly political control issues, critics of governance have
              | questioned the capacity of these models to explain adequately the actual selection and
              | delivery of services, especially when considered in a democratic framework.
              | 5. Bridging the Gap: Meta-Governance
              | The theoretical development in governance has now extended to the idea of “meta-
              | governance”, meaning in essence the governance of governance (see O’Toole, 2007). The
              | weaknesses of governance as an encompassing concept for describing what occurs within
              | in the contemporary processes of governing have become more apparent, even to some
              | advocates of the approach. This awareness has generated the need to think about the
              | means of building into governing processes increased control, while at the same time
              | permitting some autonomy for the networks and other forms of decentered governing. Any
              | reasonable conceptualization of contemporary governance processes must contain a great
              | deal of decentered activity, and recognize that it is impossible to return to the status quo
              | ante. At the same time, however, that conceptualization must also recognize that all of the
              | 10 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H S
              | requisite functions of governing a society can not be fulfilled by those decentered
              | processes.11
              | Developing a working conception of meta-governance therefore helps to bridge the gap
              | between the disaggregated processes within the contemporary public sector and the desire
              | of many political principals to restore some direct control. In the bluntest terms then meta-
              | governance would simply be reneging on the delegations of power and recenteralizing
              | controls in the structures associated with the “conventional” public sector. As already argued,
              | such a simplistic response is unlikely to be successful, and may not be politically viable.12
              | The reforms of the past several decades are not unpopular with many people in and out of
              | government, and have created their own constituencies. Further, the ideology of New Public
              | Management continues to be widely accepted and those ideas continue to motivate policy
              | choices concerning internal management. The discourse surrounding public management
              | has been altered in a fundamental manner so that any simplistic atavistic response is
              | unlikely to be acceptable.
              | As well as thinking about meta-governance as a simple reaction to changes in the public
              | sector, and an attempt to recreate the past, it must also be understood as creating the
              | conditions under which governance models can perform effectively. For example, much of
              | the governance literature assumes that networks are self-organizing and autonomous, but in
              | many cases they must be created and fostered, often by the State. Likewise, in order to be
              | effective, a network must have a point of access in the public sector that legitimates and
              | motivates the involvement of the members, with public bureaucracies providing most of
              | those points of access. In addition, the actions of any policy network may have to be
              | legitimated and the formal institutions of the public sector themselves may be crucial for that
              | legitimation. In short, no matter how substantial the internal capacity of the network may be,
              | it may not be effective without the active involvement of government.
              | 6. The Instruments of Meta-Governance
              | Governments have at their disposal much of the same toolbox for meta-governance that they
              | have for coping with other policy problems, but those tools are available in somewhat
              | different mixtures. The mixture has changed in part because of the specific tasks involved in
              | 11 Yes, this is a functionalist approach to politics and government. Although often denigrated functionalist
              | approaches do have the capacity to identify important issues and also to identify the possible solutions to those
              | problems. In particular, in this instance knowing what must be done to govern helps to understand why the
              | decentered formats may be inadequate.
              | 12 The politics involved here are more likely institutional politics, defending the prerogatives of some organization or
              | program or another, rather than partisan politics. Those institutional interests may, of course, be connected to the
              | social interests being served by the organizations involved.
              | I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 11
              | meta-governance as opposed to those of attempting to influence society. Importantly, meta-
              | governance involves attempting to shape behaviors of organizations that have some political
              | legitimacy of their own so that some of the usual authoritative relationship may not be as
              | viable. The mixture of tools is now also different for meta-governance because there has
              | been some general move toward “New Governance” (Salamon, 2001), implying using
              | negotiation, bargaining and broader ranges of compliance than in conventional command
              | and control styles of intervention. Given the general differences in meta-governance from
              | governance, it is necessary to consider some range of alternatives, or complements, to
              | those conventional mechanisms.
              | Priority Setting. Perhaps the fundamental strategy for meta-governance is establishing
              | priorities, and establishing them politically. A fundamental weakness in the network and other
              | decentered forms of governing is that all programs and goals are virtually equal. This
              | equality is largely a function of delegating authority to organizations, all of whom presume
              | that their programs are at least as valuable as everyone else’s program. Likewise, even if the
              | decentered aspects of government are autonomous and quasi-autonomous organizations
              | they still assume that they have been granted that autonomy in order to pursue their own
              | goals, rather than any more comprehensive goals for the “Whole of Government”.13
              | Priority setting can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Most involve enhancing the
              | capacity of presidents, prime ministers and their central agencies. This need to strengthen
              | the center may appear somewhat ironic, given the tendency of parliamentary regimes to
              | discuss the “presidentialization” of politics, but the focus on the chief executive is often more
              | a media event than a reflection of the capacity for governance (Peters, 2007). There are
              | some real attempts to strengthen the center and establish priorities. For example, the
              | Finnish government now creates several cross-cutting programs as components of the
              | coalition documents for each new government (Bouckaert, Ormond and Peters, 2000). Other
              | governments have attempted to restore some capacity to govern from the center (Savoie,
              | 2004), but the capacity to govern from the center still appears weaker than might be
              | expected.
              | Soft Law. If conventional uses of authority are not appropriate for the tasks of meta-
              | governance then some “softer” alternatives may be the necessary response. The shift to soft
              | law has been evident not just for meta-governance but like other elements of new
              | governance has been applied to a range of situations (Morth, 2003). The basic notion of this
              | approach to governing has been to use instruments such as benchmarks, guidelines,
              | frameworks, and a host of other mechanisms that establish ranges of compliance rather than
              | 13 This term has been used by the Australian government and several other national governments to indicate the
              | importance of creating more comprehensive approaches to governing. Even in those cases, however, the links to
              | private sector organizations, and even sub-national governments, delivering public services often are not
              | adequately institutionalized.
              | 12 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H S
              | specific points of compliance. Further, these instruments tend to be the products of
              | discussions and negotiations rather than imposition from above.
              | The nature of soft law is to establish ranges of compliance and provide direction rather than
              | command action. This response to the meta-governance problem reflects the need to steer
              | but continue to do so at a distance, allowing a range of responses from networks, or local
              | governments. The “softness” of the law may vary depending upon the object of the steering.
              | For example, attempting to control sub-national governments that have some political base
              | of their own may be more challenging than attempting to control the private members of a
              | network. Further, the capacity to use soft law effectively may vary across policy areas, with
              | those involving more directly the formal powers of the State being less amenable to informal
              | styles of steering and governance.14
              | 7. Maintaining the Golden Thread
              | Strategies of decentering government and loosening control involve minimizing direct
              | controls over organizations and networks. For actors at the center, however, reducing levels
              | of control may not mean totally abandoning it, and some means of control may still be
              | maintained while simultaneously permitting autonomy in other areas of activity. Indeed, one
              | of the more interesting aspects of the contemporary discussions about autonomy and control
              | within the public sector is the dance being danced by central control structures and
              | agencies, quangos and sub-national governments to whom substantial autonomy has been
              | granted, at least in theory (see Yesilkagit, 2007).
              | Analytically, we (Bouckaert, Peters and Verhoest, 2007) have elsewhere discussed the
              | autonomy of public organizations as involving three substantive dimensions – financial,
              | human resources and policy. Thus, an organization may be given the latitude to make its
              | own decisions about personnel and about spending, but the center may retain control over
              | the policy choices of the organization. The available evidence, albeit generally not expressed
              | in terms of meta-governance, is that central governments tend to maintain the financial purse
              | strings and use those to ensure adequate compliance along other dimensions of activity
              | (Wanna, Jensen and De Vries, 2004). As well as varying substantively, the maintenance of
              | controls from the center may also be strategic or operational. That is, the control
              | organizations may attempt to either control the frame of action of the (presumably)
              | autonomous organizations or they may attempt more direct management of the day-to-day
              | decisions made by the organizations. The former may more clearly approximate the logic of
              | 14 For example, see the discussion of informal governance mechanisms by Helmke and Levitsky (2004).

              | “steering at a distance”, but both represent some diminution of the real autonomy of the
              | organizations.
              | The point of this discussion is that autonomy and control may not be as incompatible in
              | practice as they may appear conceptually. The logic of meta-governance, and the “knitting”
              | to which I alluded above, is that both these concepts must co-exist, and are beginning to co-
              | exist more effectively, within contemporary political systems. As argued concerning the
              | utilization of soft law as an instrument for meta-governance, the actual mixture of autonomy
              | and control is likely to be contingent, and may also be dependent upon the particular political
              | system. The task for both the academic analyst and the practitioner is to identify mixtures
              | that can at once deliver effective political (democratic) control and maintain the efficiency
              | gains that appear to have resulted from many of the NPM reforms. To square this circle
              | maintaining one or a few primary controls, usually the budget, may be an effective strategy
              | for meta-governance.
              | 8. Performance Management
              | Finally, the increasing use of performance management in almost all developed
              | democracies, and many other systems, provides a means of controlling potentially
              | autonomous organizations (see OECD, 2007; Peters, 2007). Although the term may be used
              | in a variety of ways, the fundamental idea is that by using measurable targets for the results
              | of public programs central control organizations can monitor and control the behavior of
              | those organizations. This technique therefore shifts the mantra of New Public Management
              | from “let the managers manage” to “make the managers manage”, meaning that some of the
              | latitude inherent in the management ideas of NPM has been lost in favor of mandates to
              | managers.
              | Performance management has some attributes in common with soft law as an instrument for
              | meta-governance. In particular, this method relies on negotiating frameworks and contracts
              | to impose control over the organizations delivering services, as well as the individuals
              | involved in those programs. The targets that are established in performance management
              | tend to be flexible, or tend to be progressive, so that the steering is rather “soft”, and permit
              | the organizations involved to have some latitude in how they reach the performance targets.
              | In addition, levels of compliance tend to be progressive so that the levels at which any
              | organization must perform tend to be negotiated year after year, with some continuing ability
              | to affect the outcomes of performance management.
              | Performance management can help to solve several of the problems created by earlier
              | reforms of the public sector. For example, when performance measurement and
              | management are used internally between ministries and their components (including
              | 14 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H S
              | perhaps contractors as well as formal institutions within the public sector) they are important
              | elements of internal management and steering. However, when applied more directly by
              | external organizations – parliaments, auditors, central agencies – then performance
              | management can be a very useful component for accountability. Especially when the
              | performance standards are made public these indicators are important for accountability as
              | well as for establishing general democratic frameworks for action.
              | Conclusion
              | Governance has been and continues to be a scarce commodity in most countries. In many
              | ways the capacity to govern has been enhanced significantly over the past several decades
              | through the spread of the ideas of both New Public Management and the ideas of
              | governance. These approaches to governing both tended to enhance the autonomy of lower
              | level components of the governing system, whether sub-national governments, agencies, or
              | networks linking public and private actors. The capacity of organizations to make more of
              | their own choices, and the capacity to employ management techniques not familiar to the
              | public sector, have tended to make government more efficient and effective in service
              | delivery.
              | Despite the successes of many aspects of reform in the public sector, the problems of
              | accountability and control that were inherent in these reforms have engendered a
              | subsequent round of change. Although it is impossible to return to the governance models
              | that were the object of the NPM and “governance” reforms, some mechanisms for
              | addressing the accountability and other fundamental democratic issues raised by the first
              | round of reforms are required. The perceived negative consequences of reforms have
              | produced some new types of governing, discussed here as “meta-governance”.
              | The primary governance task, as outlined in this paper, therefore is to knit together these two
              | strands of change in the public sector. While the one strand represents the efficiency drives
              | of governing, the other tends to represent better the political, and especially democratic,
              | aspirations for governing. The fundamental point here is that these two can be knit together
              | effectively, but that the knitting will depend upon a number of contingent factors. The first
              | rounds of reform (and especially NPM) tended to assume that one size fit all, but the ability
              | to use management techniques as well as the types of meta-governance that are viable are
              | dependent upon a number of political and policy factors that require additional explication.
              | Thus, the task of coping with governance will continue to require extensive research and
              | analysis by both practitioner and academic analysts.
