              | Abstract: The article is a guided tour to Alfred LORENZER's proposal for an "in-depth
              | hermeneutic" cultural analysis methodology which was launched in an environment with an almost
              | complete split between social sciences and psychology/psychoanalysis. It presents the background
              | in his materialist socialization theory, which combines a social reinterpretation of the core insights in
              | classical psychoanalysis—the unconscious, the drives—with a theory of language acquisition. His
              | methodology is based on a transformation of the "scenic understanding" from a clinical to a text
              | interpretation, which seeks to understand collective unconscious meaning in text, and is presented
              | with an illustration of the interpretation procedure from social research. Then follows a brief
              | systematic account of key concepts and ideas—interaction forms, engrams, experience,
              | symbolization, language game, utopian imagination—with an outlook to the social theory
              | connections to the Frankfurt School. The practical interpretation procedure in a LORENZER-based
              | psycho-societal research is briefly summarized, emphasizing the role of the researcher subjects in
              | discovering socially unconscious meaning in social interaction. Finally an outlook to contemporary
              | epistemological issues. LORENZER's approach to theorize and research the subject as a socially
              | produced entity appears as a psycho-societal alternative to mainstream social constructivism.

              | incompatible with the anthropological presuppositions of Marxism), completely
              | oblivious of the existence of a Meadian theory of the dialectic between society and
              | the individual that would be immeasurably more congenial to their own approach. For
              | a recent example of this ironic phenomenon, cf. Georges Lapassade, L'entrée dans
              | la Vie (Paris, Eds. de Minuit, 1963)" (BERGER & LUCKMANN, 1966, p.218, Note
              | 25). [1]
              | Symbolic interactionism, inspired from phenomenology, and action sociology
              | primarily sees society as conscious and meaningful agency in the life world and
              | BERGER and LUCKMANN argue that knowledge sociology provides the
              | understanding of how agency makes up the foundation for societal structure
              | through a process of sedimentation and/or reification. Obviously they see MEAD's
              | social psychology as the concept best theorizing the subjectivity of agency. Their
              | account of socialization is almost exclusively about the societal imprint on the
              | individual agent—c.f. the reference to MEAD. The role of subjectivity in history
              | (and BERGER & LUCKMANN's theory is actually also a historical account of the
              | emergence of society) remains largely untheorized in its own right, and they
              | explicitly and very quickly abstain from elaborating "a genuinely dialectic social
              | psychology" which they admit would be the proper alternative to the alliance they
              | despise (p.230, Note 7). [2]
              | They continue, in another note:
              | "There is a fundamental dichotomy between the conception of man as a self-
              | producing being and conception of 'human nature'. This constitutes a decisive
              | anthropological difference between Marx and any properly sociological perspective
              | on the one hand (especially one that is grounded in Meadian social psychology) and
              | Freud and most non-Freudian psychological perspectives on the other" (p.220, Note
              | 7). [3]
              | It is a bit strange, in view of BERGER and LUCKMANN 's ambitious project, to
              | launch such theoretical demarcations in a note. I tend to see these comments as
              | symptoms of a latent awareness of a problem—a stone in the shoe—a problem
              | that has not been thematized before but presses itself into the horizon of
              | BERGER and LUCKMANN's otherwise extremely embracing and integrative
              | work. [4]
              | The point about FREUD is beyond dispute, but also obsolete. Apart from the one
              | work mentioned we may after all assume that most of the psychoanalysts that
              | European Marxists approached in the 1960's already theorized psychodynamics
              | socially, and were politically and theoretically committed to an emancipatory
              | thinking in which human agency and consciousness was essential (e.g.
              | MITSCHERLICH, 1963). BERGER and LUCKMANN might also have noticed, at
              | the opposite side of the gorge, ERIKSON's development of a cultural psychology
              | (1950) as an attempt to understand the dialectic between the individual and
              | society on a psychoanalytic ground—although in the first place limited to child
              | socialization and kept within a developmental psychology framework. In Europe
              | the ethnopsychoanalysts simultaneously analyzed the dialectic between individual

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | and society in the remote Dogon culture (PARIN, MORGENTHALER & PARIN-
              | MATTHÈY, 1963), de facto defining personality structures as a result of cultural
              | environment—later generalized into a revised psychodynamic theory (PARIN,
              | 1983). [5]
              | These comments from BERGER and LUCKMANN (1966) remind about the
              | fundamental challenge connected with the conception of subjectivity and the
              | relation between individual and society in a social science landscape where the
              | disciplinary domains separated knowledge of the individual from knowledge about
              | society. It may also reflect an enduring prejudiced tendency to see
              | psychoanalysis as a closed community, not recognizing the very fundamental
              | ongoing discussions between Freudian psychoanalysts and several re-
              | interpretations of the origins of the inner psychic structures. In this landscape it
              | appears even more remarkable, that Alfred LORENZER developed a theory
              | which took the challenge to develop a social reinterpretation of FREUD's basic
              | ideas on a materialistic ground which might easily be mistaken for a biological
              | and deterministic in the way BERGER and LUCKMANN obviously see the
              | psychoanalysis. [6]
              | When we have focused on LORENZER within a broad and multiple tradition of
              | combining a Marxian analysis of society (Frankfurt School critical theory) and
              | psycho-dynamic theorizing of the subject it had two interrelated reasons. One is
              | that he has been particularly productive for the development of a methodology of
              | empirical qualitative research. The other one is that his socialization theory by
              | focusing on language at the same time as maintaining a clearly materialistic view
              | on the body as well as on the socio-material structure of society has provided a
              | key contribution to theoretical and epistemological issues of social science, that
              | have become articulated much later. We shall come back to this at the end of this
              | article. [7]
              | 2. Alfred LORENZER's Intellectual Journey
              | Alfred LORENZER (1922-2002) came from the background of being a medical
              | psychiatrist, trained in psychoanalysis on a Freudian background. As a doctor
              | and psychoanalyst, he took an early interest in societal critique and cultural
              | theory, taking to task the Frankfurt school of thought and its critical theory.
              | Understanding subjective structure as influenced by societal conditions
              | increasingly came to dominate his theoretical thoughts. As early as 1970, he
              | criticized the psychoanalytical concept of "symbol" (1970a), placed it in a
              | linguistic science context (1970b), and subsequently expanded the application of
              | it into socialization theory (1972), epistemology (1974) and cultural analysis
              | (1986). The red thread of his contribution is to provide a ground for a social
              | interpretation of the basic psychodynamic forces without giving up the radical
              | insights in FREUD's theory. The first step in this chain from psychoanalysis to
              | societal theory was an interactionist theory of socialization (1972) in which he
              | reconceptualized these psychodynamic forces which in classical psychoanalysis
              | since FREUD were seen as biological, result of natural drives. LORENZER
              | established a dialectical theory according to which they were results of the social
              | © 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/
              | FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,
              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | interaction, in the first place between infant and mother (caring person), and
              | thereby also enabled an understanding of the unconscious—the most radical
              | element in psychoanalysis—as a result of the symbolic interaction. The following
              | works developed methodological ideas for an endogenous understanding of the
              | subjective dimensions of social interaction and language—quite opposite to the
              | direction FREUD took in meta-psychological and cultural theory. [8]
              | The point of departure in LORENZER's relevance to current theoretical, social
              | and political issues is the Copernican turn of the Freudian theory which had been
              | initiated by a number of psychoanalysts: In continuation of FREUD he analyzes
              | the development of the structure of personality as "representing experiences of
              | bodily interactions" (1972, p.17; see the Acknowledgments for translation issues).
              | But whereas FREUD saw their impact in the psyche, as predominantly distortion,
              | disturbance and blocking of (biological) drives in the subject LORENZER sees
              | these social interactions and the bodily experiences of them as a dialectical
              | shaping of the drives into a subject, and the resulting psychic dynamics as highly
              | social phenomena. The individual sensual experiences of social relations and
              | meanings in immediate interaction are connected with the wider social world in
              | the form of symbols. The issues of psychotherapy, disturbances of the psychic
              | development, were reinterpreted as disturbances of the possibility to symbolize
              | individual sensual experiences in socially recognized language. LORENZER's
              | critical reinterpretation of the psychic disturbances are expressed in the early
              | book titles "Zur Kritik des psychoanalytischen Symbolbegriffs" ["Critique of the
              | Psychoanalytic Concept of Symbol"] (1970a) and "Sprachzerstörung und
              | Rekonstruktion" ["Language Destruction and Reconstruction"] (1970b). On the
              | one hand enabling a reinterpretation of the psychotherapeutic task, this critique
              | on the other hand opens a new way of theorizing the psychodynamic aspects of
              | societal relations. Symbolic/cultural meaning (for the individual) is seen as a
              | complex mediation of social interaction and sensual experience, and has
              | conscious as well as unconscious aspects. Later LORENZER developed further
              | his key concept of "interaction forms" to understand the inner, pre-linguistic
              | experiences of practices and relations. These interaction forms are connected
              | with the socially recognized language to form symbolic interaction forms, and the
              | developing of capacity for symbolic production can be seen as an integrated
              | aspect of socialization. This understanding of the early socialization process
              | enables LORENZER to see language, interaction and bodily (drive) processes in
              | their wider societal context—and we can add an epistemological perspective: In
              | the context of a constructivist social science it enables us to see how ideas about
              | societal relations are embodied in the individual socialization. LORENZER's
              | thoughts on the role of language in subject constitution build on the theorem of
              | language games, which he took up from the works of Ludwig WITTGENSTEIN
              | and developed further. Language is anchored in concrete social practice in a
              | dialectic unit of language use, everyday life practice and view of the world
              | (WEBER, 2010). Language games are thus defined as the interface at which
              | subjective and objective structures interact. The question of the constitution of
              | language games is, therefore, also one which addresses the constitution of the
              | relationship between individual and society. Looked at in this way, language and
              | awareness are inseparably linked with social practice. If the constitution of
              | © 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | language games is seen as integral to the development of subjective structures
              | under objective conditions, then the individual subject can be understood and
              | deciphered using its ex ante social reference. [9]
              | LORENZER's contribution to the methodology gains a wider perspective by
              | theorizing the genesis of the correspondence between unconscious dynamics in
              | the subject and unconscious or unintended dimensions of societal and cultural
              | processes. What is in the first place mainly a material theory of socialization—
              | which unlike many other theories does not see the social shaping of the individual
              | as assimilation to social structure—is in the second place a radical epistemology
              | of societal dynamics. LORENZER's theory of language games and his meta-
              | psychological and methodological notions are closely linked with the search for
              | opportunities for epistemic reconstruction of suppressed social relationships,
              | which are (societally) imprinted in the (many individual) psyches and in their
              | interaction. LORENZER in brief draws the attention to the hermeneutic
              | methodology of psychoanalytic understanding. The immediate inspiration is
              | offered by an interpretation of interaction and cultural meaning in a way inspired
              | by psychoanalytic interpretation, namely "scenic understanding" whose further
              | methodological foundations and methodical implementation will be taken up
              | further in this article. LORENZER separates the methodological principles of
              | psychoanalysis—simultaneous attention, free association and the concepts of
              | transfer and counter-transfer—from the clinical context of doctor-patient
              | relationships, and transfers them to social and cultural scientific practice. He thus
              | emphasizes the methodological experience as opposed to direct transfers of
              | theoretical models since, in his view, these cannot be transferred from one field to
              | another. [10]
              | The socialization theory was LORENZER's first distinguishing contribution. It
              | builds the theoretical foundation for the development of a psycho-societal
              | interpretation method with inspiration from the psycho-analytical interpretation of
              | individuals. During the 1970's his work was widely cited and read both in
              | Germany and abroad (notably the Scandinavian countries) and today, his ideas
              | continue to inform a vigorous tradition of cultural analysis and social research
              | (LEITHÄUSER & VOLMERG, 1988; LEITHÄUSER, 1976; MORGENROTH, 1990,
              | 2010; BERESWILL, 2008; LORENZER, 1970a, 1970b, 1972, 1974, 1977, 1986,
              | 2006; PROKOP, FRIESE & STACH, 2009). A number of Scandinavian, especially
              | Danish researchers have published work directly referring to this tradition, or
              | using the methods more or less in accordance with it, most of it published in
              | Danish (for an overview see WEBER, 1996, 2007, 2009, 2010; SALLING
              | OLESEN, 2004, 2007a, 2007b, 2011; SALLLING OLESEN & WEBER, 2001,
              | 2002). However, LORENZER is little known outside German speaking
              | communities. For a long time, only one small example of his work has been
              | published in English translation (LORENZER & ORBAN, 1978). Later another text
              | has been introduced, translated and posted in the internet (LORENZER, 2002a
              | [1981]; SCHAFFRIK, 2002). But "in-depth hermeneutic analysis" remains largely
              | unfamiliar to English-speaking audiences. When we in a joint research network
              | explored the parallels between this tradition and pioneering work in the
              | Anglophone psycho-social research (e.g. HOLLWAY & JEFFERSON, 2000), the
              | © 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/
              | FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,
              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | language based a-symmetry was obvious and it seemed imperative to provide
              | access to some of the non-Anglophone research tradition to a wider audience. [11]
              | In the following we will concentrate on the methodological impulse from cultural
              | analysis in social research. In a late stage of his work, in the key text in
              | "KulturAnalysen" [Cultural Analyses] (1986), he coins the (title)notion of
              | "Tiefenhermeneutische Kulturanalyse" [In-depth Hermeneutic Cultural Analysis],
              | which focuses on the systematic reconstruction of unconscious meaning
              | dimensions in analysis of literary texts. This text played a significant role in the
              | intensive multilingual discourse in our research network between Danish, German
              | and British researchers, of which half were not German-speaking, facilitated by a
              | translation (by Mechthild BERESWILL & Christine MORGENROTH, unpublished).
              | The book as a whole is a collective work with a number of case studies, mainly on
              | literary texts, but also one (by Søren NAGBØL) extending the horizon to
              | architecture. "KulturAnalysen" ["Cultural Analyses"] (1986) summarizes the
              | contribution of his interaction theory extensions of psychoanalysis from the 1960s
              | and 1970s and may be read as the key text to the complex meta-theoretical ideas
              | that have proven useful in empirical studies in many areas of social life under the
              | general heading of "Tiefenhermeneutik" [In-depth Hermeneutic] (1986). [12]
              | LORENZER believes this is where what he calls the "hard and provocative work"
              | (1986, pp.16f.) in the psychoanalytical critique of society and culture enters. He
              | sees the position of psychoanalysis between differing disciplines against whose
              | borders it grates. The "conflict potential" of a psychoanalytic approach
              | traditionally arises from revealing the social constraints a subject faces, but, more
              | importantly, how desires and past experiences may influence e.g. cultural
              | productions like literature. LORENZER here emphasizes the difference between
              | a therapeutic and a social or literary discovery process:
              | "Where therapy is concerned, the origin [of the subject] is investigated by asking: how
              | did the conflict arise in the case of this individual? In cultural analysis, however, the
              | question is: what kind of conflict are we dealing with? The focus is on the conflict
              | between unconscious desires and conscious values" (p.67). [13]
              | In fact the notion of conflict in the last sentence might be a bit misleading in
              | translation—in LORENZER's German text it reads "Auseinandersetzung
              | zwischen," which implies "intensive interrelation" or "interaction between" in the
              | sense of connecting rather than a conflict between two independent opposing
              | parties, or in philosophical terms: It is an intrinsic rather than an extrinsic relation.
              | In LORENZER's thinking the relation between the conscious and the unconscious
              | levels of the subject is more complex than just being a conflict. They are both
              | influenced by experiences in the past, and conscious and unconscious dynamics
              | interrelate in the ongoing processing of cognitive and emotional aspects of
              | experiences. Unconscious dynamics which refer to contradictions experienced in
              | the past (and hence of cultural and societal nature), which may have become
              | unconscious, while their conflictual meaning may have been transferred to
              | another content are particularly important in the original therapeutic context. But
              | the very existence of unconscious dynamics which are of cultural and societal

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | nature, and the fact that they remain in interaction with meaning making and
              | conscious engagements in the present is the important insight for interpretation of
              | social interaction and cultural meanings. LORENZER and his colleagues
              | eventually demonstrates this potential in interpretation of arts products, but the
              | insights in societal nature of the subjective processes opens a door to interpret
              | not only cultural products, but to interpret interviews and other qualitative material
              | from empirical research of a wide range of more profane social practices and
              | spheres. [14]
              | 3. In-depth Hermeneutic Cultural Analysis
              | Alfred LORENZER's introduction article "Tiefenhermeneutische Kulturanalysen"
              | in the book "KulturAnalysen" (1986) is as close as he comes to spell out a
              | methodology. Basically he points to the hermeneutic (interpretational) nature of
              | the form of understanding which is used in psychoanalytical therapeutic practice,
              | generalizes it in what he calls the "scenic understanding," and comments the
              | nature of this transformation. The particular value of these thoughts mainly
              | become evident in reflecting a research practice by means of researchers
              | subjectively engaging in the interpretation, tracing aspects of social relations
              | which are not immediately visible and may be not even conscious for social
              | actors. For this reason we developed an interpretation process example of a text
              | which had been presented in the research group. In the following this sample
              | scene and our interpretation of it will be used for illustration linking our
              | interpretation steps along this short sequence with central passages of
              | LORENZER's text. As it usually is the case the interpretation process became an
              | illustration in itself—interpretation requires the engagement of the interpreters in
              | an interaction with the text which transcends the obvious meaning of the text, and
              | hence becomes part of the interpretation in itself. We took up a brief scene
              | presented in the Dubrovnik workshops by our British colleague Joanne
              | WHITEHOUSE, who used qualitative methods to study a popular yet highly
              | contested form of media product—the reality TV program Big Brother, which has
              | sparked heated debate not just in Great Britain (REDMANN & WHITEHOUSE-
              | HARE, 2008). We wanted to illustrate LORENZER's methodological and meta-
              | theoretical reflections using an empirical example from the discipline of cultural
              | studies to show what scenic understanding might mean for empirical analysis. [15]
              | We analyzed the reaction of a female viewer as portrayed in the following scene.
              | We interpreted the scene as a representation, not as a factual account that can
              | be read at face value, and not as a transparent subjective expression. We
              | assumed that such representations are based on shared cultural experience and
              | provide us with access to subjective and social dynamics, which we attempt to
              | reveal with the aid of LORENZER's thinking. [16]
              | The structure of this type of program is a closed group who is monitored in their
              | interaction, and the viewers are invited to vote about who should be sent home at
              | each stage of the show. An interviewee, Lou, reported (to Joanne) that she had
              | been watching an episode of Big Brother. One of the housemates, Jonny, offered
              | a second housemate, Adele, a cup of coffee. Adele refused in a friendly fashion
              | © 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | but as Jonny walked away she mouthed the words "Fuck off" to his retreating
              | back. The interviewee, Lou, was so outraged by what she took to be Adele's two-
              | faced behavior that she decided she would vote to have Adele evicted from the
              | show and, moreover, that she had to do this straight away. Because her own
              | phone was out of order she rushed from the house to use a public phone box on
              | the corner of her street. Unfortunately, the phone box was occupied and, feeling
              | increasingly frustrated, the interviewee started banging on the phone box door
              | telling the person using it to hurry up. "I just wanted her (i.e. Adele) out," she
              | explained in the interview. [17]
              | At first glance the text we looked at irritates and confuses, displays a remarkable
              | amount of emotion and contains a variety of action and interaction levels which all
              | run together. It may also provoke normative reactions in the interpreter, not least
              | as regards the contested TV format that attracts large numbers of viewers. The
              | scientific and popular controversies concerning a program like Big Brother thus
              | point to underlying issues of subject and society in the context of social change:
              | on the one hand the age-old discussion about how much influence mass media
              | has in guiding people's actions, on the other hand the much more interesting
              | question about how the contents of the media engage with the subjective issues
              | of the audiences. [18]
              | The manifest meaning of the sequence is readily visible: we are witness to an
              | emotionally loaded reaction in the context of a medially presented group player
              | game. The structure of sequence the constitutes a dual scene: contestants in the
              | containers and contestants in front on the TV enter into a relationship with one
              | another whereby the quality of their relationships is the key to further exclusion or
              | inclusion of individual players. In other words, the publicly celebrated relationships
              | between the inhabitants of the container give the viewers a chance to enter into a
              | relationship which forms the basis for their decision on whether or not to vote for
              | or against a particular contestant. [19]
              | There are several simplistic interpretations of the scene which are near at hand
              | (and the interpreting group did not evade the temptation in the first place): we
              | could interpret it as a confirmation of a culturally pessimistic standpoint
              | concerning the increasing degeneration of the mass media, or in a more or less
              | psychological sense as an expression of a threatened if not damaged subjectivity
              | which comes to light with the loss of key self-determination skills. Although
              | different in focus they both leave little space for understanding subjective agency.
              | In a way they treat the social agent as a patient and diagnose his/her vulnerability
              | for social conditions. Alfred LORENZER provides the theoretical arguments for
              | avoiding such premature classifications. In LORENZER's work, we read that
              | apart from the manifest and latent meaning levels "texts" house an unconscious
              | meaning dimension which we can enter as readers, as observers or as
              | researchers.
              | "The impulse in psychoanalytical therapy is to change the patient who is being
              | analyzed. In the reader-text relationship the opposite is the case. Here it is the
              | reader/analyst who is subject to change. If the reader as an interpreter acknowledges
              | © 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/
              | FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,
              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | the emotional power of the text and does not stand in awe of it, his consciousness will
              | be changed—at least, this is the case if he does not abuse the text-reader
              | relationship by simply reading into the text a pre-existing and well known version of
              | psychoanalysis" (1986, p.28, our translation). [20]
              | This distinction takes our attention in another direction. We concern ourselves
              | with the emotional power of the text and thus with the relationships it offers to the
              | readers. How do we as interpreters take up this offer? How do we react to Lou's
              | description—normatively, amused or intrigued? This line of thinking may be easily
              | accepted when dealing with "fine arts"—it resonances discussions about the
              | criteria of quality in poetry, e.g.—but here we deal with a profane narrative about
              | profane television watching. Posing these questions to the interpreters of the
              | short research scene led us away from commenting and classifying the actions in
              | the actual text per se, and towards its emotional qualities and evocative power in
              | relation to the reader. And further the question of the 'relationship between text
              | and reader' applies to the relation between the Big Brother-show and its viewers,
              | in this case to Lou. What is it that makes her act so impulsively? If we go by what
              | she says, then contestant Adele's two-faced attitude is what made Lou want to
              | vote Adele immediately off the show and head out to find a telephone. According
              | to Lou, Adele's behavior, which she describes as two-faced and underhandedly
              | aggressive, sparked her unbridled anger; she is openly aggressive and attacks
              | another person within her action radius. [21]
              | The theoretical distinction of psychoanalysis is the theory of the unconscious
              | (FREUD, 1957 [1915]). It is actually a more complicated theory about levels of
              | (un)consciousness with grey zones and displacements, which in FREUD's
              | version is a precondition for the therapeutic process as well as for the
              | interpretation of dreams. The first methodical issue is to gain access to this level,
              | not with an individual therapeutic aim, but in order to understand its social
              | meaning. The interpretation of texts, be they literary works, field notes or excerpts
              | from interviews, also constitutes a multilayered scene. In the case in question, we
              | reconstruct a dual scene in which various interaction dynamics overlay one
              | another and create a new scene in which we as interpreters become involved
              | relative to those dynamics. We find Lou's extreme over-reaction difficult to
              | understand and tend to distance ourselves from it. [22]
              | LORENZER goes on to say that literary texts contain a provocation which goes
              | beyond individual and biographically specific reception patterns and points to
              | societal, collective motives and meaning substance:
              | "The provocation lies in content in the text itself. As such, its impact goes beyond the
              | individual, it is perhaps societal-collective [gesellschaftlich-kollektiv], possibly even
              | spread over many epochs. The unconscious in literature under consideration, is a
              | collective unconscious, although admittedly not in Jung's sense. It consists of praxis
              | figures [Praxisfiguren], which—as it were—demand to enter consciousness, and
              | contains forms of life [Lebensformen], whose access to general consciousness has
              | been barred and whose value, in consequence, has not been openly tried out" (1986,
              | p.28, our translation). [23]

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | In interactionist (social) reinterpretations of psychoanalytical theory, including
              | LORENZER's theory of socialization, the unconscious level is just as much as the
              | conscious a result of life history experience of social interaction. For the same
              | reason the unconscious is assumed to contain a potential for social imagination
              | which goes beyond the actual state of consciousness—either because it contains
              | interaction experiences that have later been excluded from consciousness, or
              | because it contains anticipating ideas of something "emerging" which has not yet
              | been realized in social practice. Continuing the previous quotation LORENZER says:
              | "These not-yet-conscious [Noch-nicht-bewusst] praxis figures—as Bloch says—
              | generate a utopian potential. It is the work of hermeneutics to reveal this utopian
              | potential and, in so doing, to take a stand against petrified circumstances
              | [versteinerte Verhältnisse]. [...] Why do we prefer the term in-depth hermeneutics to
              | characterize this approach? The answer is: because the practice of in-depth
              | hermeneutics is the distinctive feature of psychoanalytical interpretation. ... The in-
              | depth element of the hermeneutic approach is only to be found in psychoanalysis and
              | underlines the central subject of psychoanalytical inquiry: the unconscious" (1986,
              | p.28, our translation). [24]
              | LORENZER's understanding of the critical and utopian potentials in the
              | unconscious articulates an important dimension in the thinking of critical theory or
              | Frankfurt school. The Frankfurt school generally sees theorizing and critique as a
              | key to social imagination and utopian ideas. And since this thinking is based on
              | materialist assumptions it means that imagination is endogenous, i.e. must be
              | discovered and articulated from within societal reality, as it is condensed in
              | ADORNO's argument in the positivist dispute:
              | "But if theory is not to fall prey to the dogmatism over whose discovery scepticism—
              | now elevated to a prohibition on thought—is always ready to rejoice, then theory may
              | not rest here. It must transform the concepts which it brings, as it were, from outside
              | into those which the objects has of itself, into what the object, left to itself, seeks to
              | be, and confront it with what it is" (1976 [1969], p.69). [25]
              | In HABERMAS' thinking the term of ideology critique spells out the need to reveal
              | endogenous potentials for societal change through a critical analysis of social
              | realities themselves. Change does not come from above or from outside. But
              | whereas HABERMAS first of all sees the key in deconstructing observation and
              | reflection of "petrified social relations" and the societal institutions which make up
              | the guises of power, social inequality and reified relations Alfred LORENZER
              | looks for the potentials in socialized psyche, in the dynamics between the
              | conscious and the unconscious. And this brings the argument back to the text:
              | "Does this imply that the unconscious is the sole aim of psychoanalytical
              | interpretation and that every 'manifest/apparent meaning', every deliberately intended
              | meaning of the text the author makes, has no significance? Indeed not, such an
              | approach would not justify the title of a psychoanalytical literary and cultural analysis.
              | This collection of analyses shows that the manifest meaning in no way can be seen

              | as a 'ladder', which can be put aside in the moment you have reached the goal 'deep
              | down there' " (1986, p.29, our translation). [26]
              | LORENZER's theoretical deliberations point to socially taboo, degenerate
              | lifestyles and utopian moments of social practice which while being unconsciously
              | maintained also emerge to influence [our] conscious, for example with the help of
              | literary texts. Their provocation, according to LORENZER, lies in the fact that
              | they transport aspects of a collective unconscious which forces itself into the
              | conscious. On the one hand Lou's arguments concerning Adele's two-faced
              | behavior lines up seamlessly with the socially accepted meaning pattern of good
              | or bad behavior. But the emotional charge "beyond the boundaries of language"
              | in the vehement desire to be rid of the other woman goes far beyond such
              | socially acknowledge configuration. To have Adele thrown off the show, Lou is
              | prepared to throw an unknown stranger out of the telephone box. [27]
              | So what is it that forces itself into consciousness? The TV show (cultural
              | meaning) elicits unconscious desires and identifications (interaction forms) which
              | influence the agency and produces an intense ambivalence. The reconstruction
              | of this ambivalence helps to reveal the unconscious in the text. We will address
              | the interpretation procedure in more detail later. For the time being, however, we
              | will stay with the relationship between manifest and latent meaning and read what
              | LORENZER thinks:
              | "... the distinguishing feature of psychoanalytical cultural analysis as an 'in-depth
              | hermeneutic' is about the recognition of an independent level of meaning below the
              | meaning generating level of language symbolism. While the manifest meaning
              | resides in the socially recognized figures of consciousness, a level of unconscious
              | interaction forms [Interaktionsformen] is pushed into consciousness on the level of
              | latent meaning. It is certainly the case that this level of meaning, 'excluded by
              | consciousness and social consensus', is one in which psychoanalysis was originally
              | interested, and which Freud counted to parapraxes. But, at the same time, the
              | manifest text-meaning is still important—as the counterpart to what is concealed-
              | forbidden. Manifest- and latent-text meaning construct a contradictory pair, which
              | psychoanalysis must seek to resolve [aufzuheben hat]" (1986, p.29, our translation). [28]
              | For cultural analysis, when unconscious interaction forms are pushed to the
              | consciousness it means that the latent meaning of a text offers a potential access
              | to understand collective dimensions of the unconscious. Manifest and latent
              | meaning are dialectically related because language use point to non-verbal or
              | pre-verbal dimensions of social interaction as LORENZER describes in the
              | concept of "unconscious interaction forms." It does not mean that we can simply
              | identify the unconscious and the non-verbal: unconscious meanings are in the
              | text as latent meaning or meaning potentials. [29]

              | only do it in the dichotomous form of voting out or in. You are not only invited to
              | make a regressive simplification of complex issues, you are forced to do it, if you
              | want to participate in the interaction. So the relation between the inner logic of the
              | show and the seemingly extreme actions of the Lou—and in the second place the
              | evocative power of the text in relation to the interpreting researchers—might be a
              | key to trace the unconscious meanings. LORENZER's attempts to characterize
              | the unconscious:
              | "The unconscious is a non-verbal, non-symbolic system of meaning, which is
              | contrary to individuals' linguistic order ... It is
              | •
              | •
              | •
              | 'autonomous', because it comes into existence within specific and concrete
              | mutual exchanges and is therefore the inscription of this particular ontogenesis
              | 'systematic', because from the first moment in a life-history, one memory trace
              | follows another each becoming interwoven with the other [organismisch]
              | 'meaning'-full because the engrams are simultaneously the sedimented forms of
              | past social interplay and drafts for that of the future (1986, pp.46-47). [30]
              | In this framework Lou's disturbingly excessive action that lends the scene
              | structure can be interpreted as systematic and meaningful in the context of
              | biographical patterns. Autonomous elements prove to be the physical action,
              | leaving the house, the purposeful movement in space, the hammering against the
              | door of the telephone box. The TV show seems to set a subject's past interaction
              | experiences in motion, which defy any language based symbolization yet remain
              | registered as a bodily experience of social interaction. The reactivation of these
              | interaction forms happens not in the sense of simple repetition of old conflicts, but
              | as part of a dynamic interaction between old, past and new, current interaction
              | experiences. The unconscious meaning of the scene points to something which is
              | unexpressed and yet symptomatic. In the first place it evaded the perception of
              | interpreters and gave way to irritation and premature classification of the
              | subjectivity of only one actor in the scene (Lou). This individual psychological
              | interpretation saw impaired ego functions: reality checks and emotional control
              | are rendered ineffective and an archaic breakthrough of revenge impulses. [31]
              | But if we look at the scene in the context of its multilayered structure, a structural
              | double bind comes to light which neither the contestant in the container nor the
              | voting viewer (like Lou) can escape: friendly, polite and civil behavior stands in
              | diametric opposition to the competitive nature of the game and the dilemma it
              | entails. Against this backdrop, Lou's rather excessive reaction can be seen to
              | perform the role assigned to her by the TV-show. But they may also encompass
              | anticipations of future behavior and interaction scenarios—imaginations about a
              | transparent and preferably dominance-free communication—her reaction is a
              | response to the unfulfilled desire for civility towards others, which Lou believes
              | Adele is failing to demonstrate. Paradoxically she is driven to the opposite
              | extreme and resorts to violence herself. [32]

              | This interpretation of the unconscious in the text refers to experiences prior to the
              | development of the ability to symbolize, yet they retain their effectiveness in
              | scenic arrangements. But it does not mean simply that unconscious/conscious is
              | the same as pre-language/linguistic—the relation is more complex:
              | "The term 'configuration of practice figures' [Gefüge von Praxisfiguren] refers to the
              | following characteristic. The interplay from which memory traces (interaction-forms)
              | emerge is nothing but the exchange of gestures, bodily movement, and socially
              | shaped and significant body processes: it is 'practice'. Every interaction-form is part
              | of this practice, and therefore encompasses but goes beyond language. Practice as a
              | whole is to some extent, submitted to the rules of language, but also partly resistant
              | and reluctant, or is part of something utopic not-yet-conscious, i.e. part of human
              | behavior that has not become encompassed in language" (1986, p.47, our
              | translation) [33]
              | But how do we store these non-language-related memory traces, and how can
              | we approach them in the interpretation? The following section explains
              | LORENZER's theory regarding the constitution of the scene in the context of
              | intra- and intersubjectivity and the role played by the body and language. The
              | following section returns to the methodological implementation in "scenic
              | understanding." [34]
              | 4. Engrams, Interaction Forms and the Language Game
              | At a very early stage in his theoretical writings, Alfred LORENZER meant that
              | interaction experiences become embodied during the embryonic phase and the
              | first few months of life. Thus, through the body's senso-motoric reactions, they
              | help to shape specific and later-life experiences. Such interaction patterns which
              | become ingrained in the body stand for an entire lifetime in a constant dialectic
              | with the discursive demands of the social environment which are subsequently
              | communicated through language. The start of this development in very early
              | childhood is both a physical and a holistic process based entirely on sensory
              | perceptions. In LORENZER's own words, this means that:
              | "The 'visual', 'tactile', 'acoustic' denote modes of sensory reception, which are
              | directed by the central nervous system from the periphery of the body and which are
              | then stored in precisely defined 'areas of the brain' (...). The inscription of these
              | visual, tactile and acoustic impressions happens via 'engrams'. These engrams are
              | 'memory traces' in Freud's terms. Although this process is common to all infants, of
              | course, the engrams of a single person are the memory traces of his or her
              | experience as a particular individual. They have an individual profile. Just as Freud
              | pointed out, in front of his time, in his book on 'Aphasie' (Freud, 1891), that cerebral
              | physiological functions and 'psychological' content cannot be separated it is obviously
              | the experiences of the memory traces which are codified as engrams. And this
              | means that the contents of memory (which is, of course, social) modifies the brain's
              | physiological structures of the nervous system. And of course the memory traces
              | combine into ideas of objects. And like the sensual impressions—visual, tactile,
              | acoustic—combine into an idea of object, likewise will the objects that are perceived

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | in different situations combine to form definite and concrete scenes. But this is
              | expressed inaccurately: Of course it is the scene which is the immediate subject of
              | the infant's experience. An awareness of individual objects only emerges from the
              | scene gradually, and may later, in differing situations, combine to form well defined
              | poles and stable figures within the scenic Gestalt" (1986, pp.41-42, our translation and
              | italics). [35]
              | Memory traces are non-verbal references to life practice, of experiences. These
              | experiences are based on the efforts to achieve pleasure and avoid unpleasure.
              | LORENZER emphasizes the "bodilyness" of these processes. LORENZER's
              | theory of the language development and the notion of scenic understanding are
              | actually in this sense coming close to contemporary cognitive science and the
              | new synthesis between "human" and "biological" understanding of the brain
              | (LORENZER, 2002b). Looked at today, he anticipates a paradigm shift in the
              | view of the brain as a holistic system (PELED, 2008; LEUZINGER-BOHLEBER
              | 1998). In memory research, embodied cognitive science has moved away from
              | the notion of the human brain being a kind of computer designed to process
              | information. Memory is now understood as an active process involving the entire
              | organism and based on senso-motoric emotion coordination processes which
              | occur in direct relationship with constantly adapting re-categorization processes.
              | In LORENZER's terms, this means that a child's early experiences of stimulus
              | response games with its mother and other close individuals are retained as
              | memory traces, as specific interaction forms. They are a lasting, natural
              | impression of genuine social interaction forms in the subject. This is what
              | LORENZER calls "socialized nature." [36]
              | But how do single memory traces become a configuration of many which evolve
              | into life experiences and a complete life world? The notion of the scenic primacy
              | poses the question the other way round. Experience is holistic, strongly shaped
              | by sensory impressions and by satisfying (or their opposite) experiences. "The
              | scene takes shape step by step through alternating and mutually constitutive
              | interactions between changing and unchanging modes of experiences" (1986,
              | p.42, our translation). [37]
              | The self-correction in the quotation (Paragraph 35, italics) is interesting—it seems
              | that LORENZER here moves from one way of seeing the development of
              | consciousness—as a combination of sensual elements into images of objects—to
              | another, more holistic, in which an undifferentiated scenic experience oriented by
              | the subject-to-be—gradually evolves through differentiation to become more
              | detailed and stable object images, and it seems as if the self-correction is a trace
              | of this theory development. The new conception aligns with empirically based
              | knowledge about infancy development (STERN, 1985). The process described
              | always involves bodily processes:

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | "If we take bodily processes into account, three aspects of the scenic become
              | apparent
              | 1. The imprint of situational experience [Situationserfahrung] is assimilated by an
              | internal ensemble of tactile, acoustic etc. receptors. Likewise the receptor
              | ensemble depicts the panorama of real impressions in the internal scenic
              | composition of the engrams.
              | 2. Even if not from the first moment but very early these situational engrams
              | repeatedly go beyond the inevitable dialectic that exists between bodily
              | sensations and their counter-impulses. The memory trace [Erinnerungsspur] is
              | more than the consequence of a simple process of stimulus-response; in itself it
              | already has sensorimotor qualities. A simple illustration of this scenic composition
              | of sensorimotor experience formation is to be found in the banal fact that the
              | stimulus is sure to provoke its reaction. For example, the noise of a mouse
              | 'results' in the cat turning its head.
              | 3. And the foundation for all this is in the scenic unity between the 'inside' and
              | 'outside', between the organism and its environment ... This interplay is the
              | foundation for everything. It remains the basic model, from which we will also
              | later have to depart" (LORENZER, 1986, p.43, our translation). [38]
              | The scene is thus shaped by the bodily referent inherent in it from the outset. A
              | child's earliest perception, no doubt while still in the womb, is a holistic
              | experience. The perceptive instruments are an ensemble of receptors which give
              | the external world in intra-psychical space a scenic structure. The bodily
              | processes described by LORENZER should not, however, be seen as natural or
              | ingrained reflexes, even if they seem quite similar. The senso-motoric process
              | can be readily recognized in a nursing mother whose milk production is activated
              | the moment her child cries and not when the hungry child starts to suck at her
              | breast. The baby's interactive need, the stimulus, is perceived and understood by
              | the mother as a holistic experience, and her body responds immediately—
              | holistically, scenically and faster than it could ever be triggered by any conscious
              | decision. But they are learned in social interaction. [39]
              | Hence, this describes the scenic unit between the organism and its environment.
              | The scene always encompasses both, "internal" and "external," and supports the
              | statement that "this interplay is the foundation for everything." Such interplay
              | provides the basis for human experience, it remains both active and necessary
              | one's whole life long and constitutes an ever-more discerning ability to take in
              | new experiences.
              | "Let us concentrate on the original experience: the scenic interplay and its effect on
              | human development. This interplay, whether occurring within pre-natal, post-natal or
              | familial constellations, has two fundamental qualities: satisfying and
              | unsatisfying/harmful. In consequence, human development occurs against the
              | background of 'ananke', the basic human state of vulnerability. Humans in particular
              | are dependent on a constantly flowing and satisfying exchange with their
              | environment. This is very obvious at the outset of life, but it continues thereafter
              | ...This state of dependency keeps this interplay going and pushes it in the direction of

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | the satisfaction of needs. Long before this compass orientating us to the satisfaction
              | of needs is laid down, there still exists a requirement that needs are met. The basic
              | human state of vulnerability is the source of the drive towards exchange and
              | interplay: the first fundamental content of this drive is directed towards satisfying
              | interactions and the defense against unsatisfying and damaging ones. The drive is
              | therefore the urge both to accept and seek out specific interactions fulfilling and
              | satisfying needs. It is clear that such requirement and needs have their origin in
              | bodily metabolism. The need for human contact evolves from this. Sexual needs bear
              | witness to these bodily origins" (p.44). [40]
              | LORENZER defines drive as the ensemble of all efforts to achieve satisfaction.
              | This satisfaction is only achievable in social relationships—also for the most basic
              | biological needs. The active search for satisfying interaction with the social
              | environment, including specific individuals with whom a relationship is formed,
              | shapes a structure of "specific interaction forms." It is the memory traces of
              | satisfying experiences which, in interplay between "internal" and "external,"
              | achieve their unmistakable form and subsequently become an ensemble, a
              | formation. LORENZER maintains the biological dimension of the drive theory by
              | emphasizing the pleasure-unpleasure principle. At the same time he integrates
              | the theory into a new view of early social interactions whose ongoing importance
              | he develops in the interplay between the internal and external, between biological
              | needs and the social forms in which they can be satisfied and are reconfigured. [41]
              | This dialectic gives rise to the life-long development dynamic of the subject in
              | interaction with other subjects and the world. But at what point does language
              | come into the game? The early pre-verbal, scenically stored interaction
              | experiences, the "specific interaction forms," gradually include verbal images
              | which appear in the interaction. Simple (pre-symbolic) interaction forms and
              | spoken words, which are in themselves holistic and situated entities of meaning,
              | defined in social interaction, are the material for the development of a symbolic
              | level. Alfred LORENZER takes up this link between interaction form and verbal
              | images, as a process of symbol-building and emphasizes that:
              | "Again: word and interaction together construct the language symbol. Therefore I
              | have called this a 'language symbolic interaction form' [Sprachsymbolische
              | Interaktionsform]. When word and interaction are joined in this way practice is—via
              | language—fully at our disposal" (p.50, our translation).
              | "The 'power of language to regulate practice' when oriented outwardly encompasses
              | what we term 'action' or 'conscious perception'. However, when oriented inwardly we
              | term it 'internal reflection', 'conscious emotion' etc. In relation to the task of
              | psychoanalysis, we can now begin to see what is meant by 'language destruction and
              | reconstruction': the separation of the unit of language and practice and conversely
              | the therapeutic attempt at their restitution" (p.51, our translation).
              | "Only when a complex of sounds has found its appropriate place in the context of the
              | language-sign, and the syntactic level of language links with the pragmatic and
              | semantic nature of language, only when this is accomplished a full language figure
              | [Sprachfigur] that corresponds with the scenic practice figure has been established.

              | Only then the language figure has assumed the nature of scenic representation"
              | (pp.52-53, our translation). [42]
              | When the interaction form in this way is symbolically expressed and thus gains
              | access to the conscious it enables reflection on one's own behavior and provides
              | the conditions necessary for reasoned tentative action. Only with language does
              | this become clearer: language symbolic interaction forms integrate social practice
              | in a more comprehensive and differentiated organization framework. [43]
              | This notion leads directly to the concept of the language game LORENZER
              | developed after WITTGENSTEIN. The latter defined the language game as a
              | dialectic unit of life practice, language use and world view (2009 [1953]).
              | WITTGENSTEIN's language game notion was in fact primarily critical to previous
              | philosophical ideas of language and scientific statements, seeing language
              | meaning as a result of language use and the social practices in which language
              | use is inscribed. LORENZER expands this notion by incorporating unconscious
              | dimensions which were not addressed in WITTGENSTEIN's concept. He sees
              | the language games not as mere conventions but as dynamic result of a
              | negotiation between language user with different experiences and practices, and
              | hence based in these social practices. With LORENZER's extension it means
              | that this negotiation also involves non- and pre-verbal experiences and also
              | harbors elements that are products of a destroyed symbolization of experience.
              | Language as an instrument of symbol-building is not simply based on the pre-
              | symbolic interaction form, but actually contains it. For this reason the pre-
              | symbolic interaction form remains virulent one's whole life long, is inseparably
              | linked to subsequent, development history-related verbal expression or, being
              | excluded from the language symbol spectrum, seeks out other-than-verbal ways
              | of finding expression. Today, it is not only clinicians but also social researchers
              | who describe this form of active expression as "enactments." They are the
              | unconscious, soulless repetition of interaction experiences that the subject, either
              | in times of great need or in response to emotional pain, has tended to separate,
              | disassociate or repress. While they cannot, therefore, be integrated into the
              | individual processing and development process, they nonetheless shape that
              | process. [44]
              | If, as described earlier, the early interaction experience cannot be symbolized it
              | still remains an action-driving component of the individual-subjective structures
              | and their experience forms. How it differs from symbolized, verbal forms is seen
              | in the subject's inability to reflect on those experience forms. The subject is not
              | able to draw upon practice through language. At the same time, as LORENZER
              | repeatedly emphasizes, the non-verbal interaction form is always linked to
              | subsequent language symbolic forms. The ability to express one self verbally and
              | pre-verbally involves many other aspects. The language game as a concept to
              | identify conflict dynamics in this dual perspective of social and individual is
              | presented in one of LORENZER's earlier works as follows:

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | "The term 'language-game' is productive in a number of ways:
              | a. As a category it refers to human 'character' rather than describing human
              | behavior. More precisely, the model of the language-game characterizes
              | individual structures as sedimented versions of concrete interactions (as
              | symbolic interaction forms), including the basic elements of both language and
              | action.
              | b. Understanding the constitution of the basic elements of language and action
              | renders visible the individual structure as the outcome of a specific production
              | process called 'socialization'. This enables us to see configurations of
              | consciousness, as well as early drafts of future action [Handlungsentwürfe] as a
              | synthesis of nature and societal practice.
              | c. When integrated into a theory of individual structures, the model of the language
              | game—embracing its constituents practice and language—provides us with a
              | useful backdrop that renders visible what was previously opaque, namely the
              | active making of configurations of consciousness as they emerge in practices
              | (both being realized in concrete interactions)" (1977, pp.34ff.). [45]
              | The term language game thus refers to three dimensions of the social: the
              | individual structure of the subjective, the socialization process and general social
              | practice. In LORENZER's work, we learned that individual structure is expression
              | of real interaction experiences from early life onwards. Social experiences in their
              | ongoing production process constitute behavioral patterns which can be
              | generalized. Through conscious verbal action, these also bring a social practice
              | to light on which they are also based. Language games can thus only be
              | understood in their social context. They assume a common practice-based
              | agreement on meaning and are always the result of social practice LORENZER,
              | 1970b). If the language game is the link between a specific interaction form and a
              | language figure, then potential disturbances and interferences in the language
              | game can be identified. The symbolic unit is dissolved when it is subject to
              | repression.
              | "When the word is separated from the interaction engram the latter once again
              | becomes an unconscious interaction form. The word, for its part, loses its relation to
              | sensual practice, it becomes emotionless, an empty sign. Thus the interaction
              | engram becomes unconscious again losing all the characteristics which it had gained
              | from its relation to the word, i.e. through its introduction into the meaning system of
              | language. In other words, what is lost is: the capacity to reflect upon behavior
              | patterns; and the capacity to "try things out" (and thus make meaningful interventions
              | in stimulus-response behavior) and to judge actions in a realistic way. ...The de-
              | symbolized language signs suffer the opposite fate. They remain in the conscious,
              | where they can be easily manipulated because they have been freed from their
              | relation to practice figures. In this state, they are nothing more than calculation and
              | cold-rational behavior, no longer capable of embodying the specific quality they
              | originally contained and that was originally experienced" (LORENZER, 1986, p.53,
              | our translation). [46]

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | LORENZER describes the characterized division between words and interaction
              | forms in previously established language games as the destruction of language.
              | The destruction of this symbolic unit reverses symbolization, hence the term
              | "desymbolization," and it may occur during (subjective) conflicts later in life. This
              | means that once achieved, the ability to symbolize (verbal expression of a
              | subjective structure) is withdrawn in relation to a specific problem which the
              | individual experiences as an inner conflict. The ability to express an experience or
              | an emotional process in words is lost in connection with the issue causing the
              | conflict. Conflict in this sense is seen as the situated clash of irreconcilable,
              | contradictory interaction forms. [47]
              | Interaction forms which are symbolized in language figures can thus be re-
              | excluded from the language context. This happens with the aid of resistance
              | mechanisms: by repressing them, they are excluded from the conscious
              | relationship between language and practice. Although this turns them back into
              | unconscious interaction forms, the very fact of this reversion allows them to retain
              | their energetic, dynamic relevance. They act as behavior drivers, albeit in the
              | form of blind action and reaction which is not open to conscious self-reflection.
              | For the individual, the recurring unconscious reenactment of a scene whose
              | structure is similar to the actual conflict, appears in the form of need for
              | repetition. [48]
              | Symbolization through language has the advantage of being brought to mind
              | independently of the real situation and thus fulfills an important function in the
              | regulation of emotion. In other words, it assists the subject's independence
              | (tentative action, hesitation). By separating the language from the interaction
              | form, the person is again made dependent from the effects of unconscious
              | conflict. He or she rarely has the power to free themselves from the dynamics of
              | the unconscious scenic processes. This is in worst case the type of problems in
              | the clinical psychoanalysis from which LORENZER starts his theorizing. [49]
              | The described division of the symbolic unit in the language game is evident in the
              | context of spoken language, in texts and in interviews. It is expressed in the
              | structures of a text and is characterized by the fact that it excludes the interaction
              | partner, say the interpreter of an interview transcription, from the direct
              | understanding. The spoken word is no longer understandable for the listener or
              | reader. The societal reference of collective meaning dimensions and a social
              | meaning is interrupted. [50]
              | So which forms of understanding might provide access to such destroyed, de-
              | symbolized language figures? A means of access is needed that reidentifies the
              | scenic unit, including when there is no or only an altered form of verbal
              | expression because the unit of language symbolic and interaction form has been
              | lost. This is where LORENZER's idea of scenic understanding has its
              | methodological significance. [51]

              | 5. Scenic Understanding
              | The basic methodological idea in LORENZER's long intellectual journey, and
              | particularly when he summarized his ideas in 1986, was the possibility to learn
              | from the type of hermeneutic process in psychoanalysis for the analysis of
              | cultural phenomena.
              | "In the psychoanalytic process, all understanding centers on and is related to the
              | mode of 'scenic understanding'. In this mode understanding is attuned to two specific
              | objects: the 'scenic drafts', i.e. the 'interaction forms' of the analysand. Particularly
              | hereby psychoanalysis provides us with a model example. If we want to understand
              | the analysand's life-practice, which does not exclude his concrete social reality, we
              | must follow the path laid down by his subjective phantasies and outlines of relations.
              | This means we must become attuned to his scenic interaction forms as these unfold
              | before us" (1977, p.125). [52]
              | What in this quotation is described as a therapeutic approach in the analyst's
              | consultation room can be transferred to understanding texts, language and
              | human behavior. Immediately, the question arises as to how a mode of
              | understanding can be practiced which explores the scenic in a non-clinical
              | context. LORENZER and his colleagues have demonstrated the approach in
              | relation to literary texts and cultural phenomena (LORENZER, 1986; PROKOP et
              | al., 2009), and we have taken it a bit further into qualitative social research in a
              | number of more profane contexts. In the following I shall discuss the
              | methodology of scenic understanding and its practical implementation. In other
              | words, how could qualitative social research understand unknown subjective
              | content and processes which include the unconscious and draw attention to non-
              | verbal messages. [53]
              | Like every hermeneutic approach it is about understanding the meaning in
              | agency and expressions, and in practical social research. Although some
              | measures can be taken to make the data suitable scenic understanding can be
              | applicable to almost any text or phenomenon referring to agency and subjective
              | expression. The prototypical material is, though, a text, or can be seen as a text.
              | More exotic ways of producing the data in the first place are videos or
              | conversations held while observing videos (second order field observation). Very
              | often the text is a transcript of a focus group discussion or thematic group
              | discussion. In other cases it may be an interview—individual or collective—or it
              | may be a field diary from an observation. [54]
              | To identify the meaning structure of a text, we may distinguish different levels of
              | interpretation:
              | 1. The obvious referential content of the text: What is being talked about?
              | 2. How do people talk to one another? This question on the meta-communicative
              | content of a text takes us to the level of scenic understanding.

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | 3. Why are the characters talking in precisely this way? How can we understand
              | it by means of theoretical knowledge combined with background factual
              | knowledge? The first of these steps is the same as in most types of qualitative
              | method. [55]
              | Step 3 might in its form remind about an explanatory approach which seeks a
              | causal or rule-based understanding. Since it is a hermeneutic methodology this is
              | not the case, instead it is a more comprehensive multilayered interpretation
              | enabled by Step 2. The scenic understanding focuses on the ongoing tense
              | relation between the manifest and the unconscious meanings of a text which
              | requires an imagination of the unconscious that we can imagine as a collective
              | reservoir of culturally rejected patterns, forbidden yearnings and suppressed
              | desires. In-depth hermeneutic interpretation thus focuses on the characters in the
              | relationship described in the text and on the dynamics of the relationship between
              | a text and its interpreter(s) in order to trace the subjective structure of cultural
              | constraints. [56]
              | The reference point in the scenic interpretation is the language used in the text,
              | with particular attention being placed on how scenes in the text point to
              | unexpressed desires and tensions, on how the text arranges "forms of
              | communication which makes the unspeakable" understandable, or "secures it an
              | unnegligible position in public space" as LORENZER says about the task of the
              | poet (1986, p.24). The initial reading seeks to apply the same type of free-floating
              | awareness [gleichschwebende Aufmerksamkeit] as is known from the clinical
              | situation: observations of the text and of one's own reactions are noted without
              | coming immediately to any particular conclusions or forming theoretical
              | definitions. Indications of hidden conflict dynamics include gaps, inconsistencies,
              | unusual use of language, jumps in the story or sudden changes of subject, and
              | remarkable ways of relating to the subject or to each other (in case of group
              | interaction texts). But also the reactions, emotional states and associations of the
              | readers/interpreters may be indications of the dynamics we are looking for—even
              | if you cannot immediately understand them (compare KÖNIG, 2008, Sections 8-
              | 10). Practically an interpretation procedure is most often organized in a group.
              | Some procedures go line by line, seeking to understand each unit of text, and
              | revising the understanding gradually as the later segments are taken into
              | consideration. Other procedures start by an open conversation conveying "first
              | impressions" and reactions from the members of the interpretation group. In
              | some cases you will experience that controversies and conflicts arise within an
              | interpretation group, evoked by the text. Using these observations and reactions
              | as a base, particularly powerful passages are subjected to in-depth analysis in
              | interpretation groups (a similarly procedure is described in MARKS & MÖNNICH-
              | MARKS, 2003). What has already been described as the transference between
              | the individual reader and the text is now transferred to a collective understanding
              | process: the transference and counter-transference dynamics multiply. This
              | procedure may lead very directly to "holistic" but preliminary interpretations that
              | are set under discussion, or it may produce several "loose ends." The
              | interpretation discussion most likely includes reference to the concrete text and
              | its manifest meaning, and it may very well also draw on theoretical frameworks
              | © 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

              | and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology
              | and on background knowledge which in the first place may support or contradict
              | the interpretations suggested. The discussion gradually moves into a validation
              | discussion. In principle the validation will refer to usual criteria and procedures for
              | validation of qualitative analysis. First of all, it will refer to the manifest text on the
              | one hand, and on the other hand to a theoretical reflection of the whole complex
              | of subjective agency and expression in the text and in the relation between the
              | text and the interpreters. [57]
              | The assumption of unconscious meaning components makes the language game
              | an instrument with which to analyze individual structures and to identify collective
              | social processes. Language figures and language symbolic interaction forms
              | always possess a social character which goes beyond the individual, because
              | they assume social understanding processes within the language community. As
              | a result, they can be analyzed for the social meaning they contain and give an
              | insight into the social configurations and their unconscious, not-yet-conscious
              | component. This is the methodological bridge which enables the unconscious
              | dimensions of experience to be accessed from language. They can also be
              | observed from the subjective perspective of the speaker and shed light on the
              | individual meaning contained in a specific scene. The language figure then
              | reports on the subjective structures and the associated experiences of social life
              | practice. [58]
              | Reacting on the remarkable behavior of Lou in the illustration example
              | interpreters were led into both an individual psychological reductive interpretation,
              | and into a cultural criticism against the seductive effects of TV shows like Big
              | Brother. We eventually resisted the temptations to leave it there. Led by the
              | theoretical points of Alfred LORENZER we developed a more comprehensive
              | psycho-societal interpretation which in no way excludes some regressive aspects
              | in the TV audience, and definitely does not exclude a critique of the quality and
              | the political dimensions of the TV shows. But we wanted to find the collective or
              | societal unconscious mechanism that the show (re)activates in Lou as in
              | everybody else, and we wanted to understand why this led her to act in this
              | enraged and seemingly irrational way—and in this sense we also wanted to
              | rehabilitate Lou as a subject in relation to her violation of good civil behavior,
              | assuming that she was enacting something that was collective and could not be
              | explained and reasoned. Referring to LORENZER's development of the language
              | game concept we would seek to trace the relation between the manifest language
              | meanings in her account, the societal meanings that are relegated to
              | unconscious interaction forms pushing on conscious recognition—and the wider
              | societal practice in which the language use makes sense. [59]
              | A lot of energy in the story told is condensed in Lou's sentence: "I just wanted her
              | out"—Lou's emotional engagement seems condensed in it, and the plot of the
              | scene seems driven by or explained by this sentence. [60]
              | On the one hand the words seem harmless. They refer to the rules of games
              | which are in broad use and enjoy great social acceptance. Through play, children
              | learn that while it is good to win, being a good loser takes far more dignity and

              | courage. It is a standard pattern in the type of TV shows to which Big Brother
              | belongs, and has spread to be one of the standard storylines of so called
              | interactive TV broadcasts. [61]
              | On the other hand Lou's words supported by characteristic behavior gives the
              | spoken words an explosiveness which seems—guided by the theory of
              | interaction forms and language—to indicate a further meaning than the
              | immediate referential one: The scene that Lou describes (which is told as having
              | taken place in the recent past) seems to have harbored a trigger stimulus which
              | forced Lou to act impulsively. Her behavior seemed designed to ensure that
              | another person be excluded and punished. On the psychological level violence
              | replaces symbolic reflection. This behavior, within a classical psycho-analytical
              | horizon, recalls the link between oedipal conflict issues from the childhood: the
              | daughter wants to push the mother out to more easily gain the father's favor. The
              | intruder is to be destroyed. Lou might have such an individual version of a
              | standard socialization experience. Although convenient, this dramatic constellation
              | from each childhood triangularization phase would be reductive and not lend a
              | cultural analytic perspective to the understanding. Instead we should look for a
              | potential correspondence between the individual subjective dynamic and societal
              | meanings that are implicitly present in the social setting of the TV show. We are
              | looking for the supra-individual, societal meaning of the story Lou tells, although
              | indirectly. The analysis so far seemed to show that the TV show (cultural
              | meaning) elicits unconscious desires and identifications (interaction forms) which
              | influence the agency and produces an intense ambivalence. The reconstruction
              | of this ambivalence should help reveal the unconscious in the text. [62]
              | If we recall the interpretations used at the beginning of this paper, the dynamic of
              | inclusion and exclusion runs through all interpretations of the text sequence. The
              | TV games are about excluding others, exclusion is an important part of the game.
              | This is bound up with the setting of norms which sanction the exclusion of others.
              | The mass viewer participation seems to indicate not only social acceptance but
              | also a widespread need to be included in the game of excluding others. Lou
              | serves as an exemplary viewer and contestant—she stands for more than just
              | herself, in that her reaction is representative of the desired inclusion of viewers in
              | the game. It seems justified to see Lou's actions and the key statement as part of
              | a language game in LORENZER's sense—combining the explicit and manifest
              | meaning with experiences of winning inclusion by joining the exclusion of others,
              | and a societal perspective in a neo-liberal society where separation prevails over
              | integration. But we may also interpret her reactions so that the participation in this
              | language game elicits ambivalent feelings. We can relate it to the moral paradox
              | that the exclusive action is justified by the defense for the moral integrity in the
              | community in the TV show container. [63]
              | With the positive evaluation of what is generally seen as negative behavior
              | (exclusion), a door is opened to judgmental and stereotypical attitudes in
              | everyday life which allow the unknown and the foreign to be negated without
              | punishment and eventually to be eliminated. The definition of foreign, unknown
              | elements as a justification for exclusion is reminiscent of the well-known studies

              | on the social function of prejudices (ADORNO, ARON, LEVINSON & MORROW,
              | 1951), in which projective power serves in shifting everything one dislikes in
              | oneself onto another group and then combating it in that group. The dynamic of
              | exclusion can take the form of collective violence if it is not harnessed and is
              | allowed to develop uncontrolled. [64]
              | Thus, the sentence "I just wanted her out" becomes a battle cry in a fight against
              | the undesirable and alien. The vehemence with which it is spouted reveals its
              | individual emotional foundation—the exclusion of the undesirable serves the
              | defense of the individuals own boundaries, the collective self is stabilized through
              | projective stigmatization of the other and the subsequent exclusion of a person
              | deemed foreign and strange. The mass reception of such TV-shows seems to
              | point to the societal strength of a language game—a combination between
              | language use, outlines of life practice and a world view in which the identification
              | with one's own group is based in excluding others who are deemed "strangers." A
              | collectively fascinating TV game which not only uses this projection mechanism
              | but nurtures it under greenhouse-like conditions helps foster general acceptance
              | of archaic, collective defensive formations. The consciousness and norms which
              | are communicated no longer need be subjected to conscious, reflective reality
              | checks. Through mass fascination and the social practice it is based upon, it
              | appears adequately legitimated. [65]
              | When we finally returned to the relation of the interpretation group: Do we also
              | have a share in the exclusion game? The individual ”clinical” interpretation of the
              | case can be recognized as a defense against the collective regression whose
              | analysis triggered outrage among the interpreters themselves. Whereas the
              | interpretation of an immature, oedipal conflict constellation or an unguided
              | individual loss of control based on a simple identification appears quite harmless.
              | Recognizing the collective nature of the unspoken interaction forms, and the
              | ambivalence in Lou's actions also makes visible that she is actually also—
              | utopian?—longing for community and integration. [66]
              | In our fellow interpreters' account (BERESWILL, MORGENROTH & REDMAN,
              | 2010) you can see this interpretation presented with a main emphasis on the
              | process in the interpretation community and the interplay between the scenes in
              | the TV-show, the scene in which Lou acts, and the scene of interpreting. This is
              | illustrating the methodological point that the transfer/counter-transfer between
              | interpreters and text take advantage of the scenic imagination. Here we
              | emphasize the aspect of theoretical guidance because the theoretical framework
              | and the psycho-societal methodological ambition—including LORENZER's notion
              | of the collective unconscious and the scenic—really were imperatives which
              | helped the interpreter group to look for the traces of the extended language game
              | in the text which did not appear easily. And this seems to be an essential lesson
              | for doing psycho-societal research. [67]

              | 6. An Epistemological Perspective: Psychoanalysis, Language and
              | Knowing
              | Alfred LORENZER's contribution enriches the interpretational social science with
              | a new theory and some quite practical inspiration for dealing empirically with the
              | subjective aspects of social agency and interaction. This is in itself highly
              | appreciated. Many qualitative methods tend to take their
              | informants/narrators/sources for granted, and to neglect the involvement of the
              | researcher subject as well (BREUER, MRUCK & ROTH, 2002). The awareness
              | of an epistemic subject-object-relativity is growing, and research activity is also
              | increasingly recognized as a social practice in it self (ROTH & BREUER, 2003),
              | but the contributions providing tools provided for reflecting researcher subjectivity
              | seem insufficient. LORENZER, among others, problematizes the subject category
              | —both the subjects in the text and the subjects who are researching— redefining
              | the need for reflection into an empirical issue. He takes over the Wittgensteinian
              | notions of language use and language games, and anchors them in the
              | socialization and the mediation of societal culture which for the individual may
              | take conscious as well as unconscious forms. Applying this extended notion of
              | language use and language game he opens a new window to the epistemic
              | process—the condition of knowing is founded in the materiality of the cultural
              | reproduction, including the researcher subject experiencing in the medium of (a)
              | language (game) and developing it. It seems also that in this way relativist
              | excesses of some contemporary constructivism can be avoided by redefining the
              | relativity issue into an empirical one. [68]
              | LORENZER goes one step deeper in theorizing the societal framework of
              | understanding the subjects—or rather the subjectivities. In this way it also seems
              | as if he avoids the risk that made BERGER and LUCKMANN (1966) warn so
              | strongly against the alliance with psycho-analysis, the risk of reducing subjectivity
              | to a mechanical "natural" causality. It seems that his consequent material and
              | endogenous notion of the unconscious enables a clearly hermeneutic stance
              | without giving up the bodily dimensions of the human subjectivity. [69]
              | BERGER and LUCKMANN's comments are particularly interesting because their
              | book has been assigned the honor to be the first main work of constructivism.
              | Both LORENZER and BERGER and LUCKMANN anticipate the poststructuralist
              | critique of Marxism. And we think that LORENZER—exactly by building on the
              | psychoanalysis that BERGER and LUCKMANN warned against—produced an
              | alternative answer to their ambition of unified social theory theorizing the agency-
              | based (re)production of societal structures. [70]
              | It is contested if BERGER and LUCKMANN's book actually belongs to the
              | tradition of social constructivism (COLLIN, 2002), but at least it has been possible
              | to interpret it into that framework. It seems more appropriate to see their book as
              | a precursor, which made visible the wider consequences for social theory of
              | theorizing knowledge as a societal phenomenon. North American constructivism
              | has developed this into an epistemology in which the role of

              | culture/knowledge/discourse surmounts the role the subject as well as the
              | societal object. [71]
              | LORENZER's work indicates a different possible continuation of BERGER and
              | LUCKMANN's story. We may see a psycho-social theory of the subject and the
              | role of language in subjectivity as a foundation for a parallel materialistic
              | constructivism, with the social philosophy of the Frankfurt School in several
              | generations as a backbone (ADORNO, 1976 [1969]). It may partly be seen as a
              | difference between an American tradition in which G.H.MEAD is a both
              | representative and distinguished figure, and a psycho-societal conception mainly
              | based in Europe A contemporary discussion of the relation between MEAD’s and
              | LORENZER's social psychology would be really interesting. The adoption or
              | refusal of a psychoanalytic understanding of the unconscious dimensions of the
              | social seems to be distinctive. ADORNO's theoretical integration of
              | psychoanalytical theory into sociology was connected with the need to
              | understand the psychic mechanisms which enabled the political success of
              | Nazism. ADORNO in his own empirical research into the social psychology of
              | authoritarianism provided a timely case for this interrelation (ADORNO et al.,
              | 1951). In order to understand in which way the particular is mediated through, but
              | not determined by, the societal whole you need to understand and examine
              | empirically also the dynamics of the individual psyche—as a mediation of societal
              | relations. Psychoanalysis was offering a theoretically developed and empirically
              | specified research into the psyche, and the interrelations between body and
              | (certain aspects of) consciousness—but it needed a reconceptualization in
              | sociological context—reinterpreting psychic dynamics as mediations of societal
              | relations—and that is to say a social psychology of culture—with implications also
              | for (scientific) knowledge. [72]
              | LORENZER's particular contribution is to present a theory of the materiality of the
              | consciousness which enables an immanent or endogenous understanding of
              | societal change, and a methodology for researching it empiricallys. The
              | development of interpretive methods building on psychoanalysis and hermeneutic
              | text interpretation enable an empirical study of how the dynamics of knowing on
              | the social level could be connected with the dynamics of inner psychic
              | experience. [73]
