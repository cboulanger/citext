              | Presently, Zimbabwe is very much out of the news. The 2013 elections
              | have come and gone; the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic
              | Front (ZANU-PF) has reasserted its hold on state power; the economy
              | is getting worse and worse; and the world continues to await the dis-
              | placement or death of the country’s nonagenarian president, Robert
              | Mugabe. In a word, it’s pretty much business as usual, except in so far as
              | the climaxing of competing tragedies in such countries as South Sudan
              | and Burundi now render Zimbabwe an African sideshow. True, there is
              | considerable interest in the intra–ZANU-PF power struggles around the
              | presidential succession, but generally the global perspective on Zim-
              | babwe is one of resignation. In essence, this contribution argues that

              | external interventions to change Zimbabwe’s course have been miserably
              | ineffective. Accordingly, a democratic solution to the country’s travails is
              | pretty much a non-starter, and the best that can be hoped for is a not-
              | too-violent political transition to a post-Mugabe order. If Zimbabweans
              | want a democracy, they must be left to create it for themselves.
              | The two books reviewed here throw much light on why this policy
              | position – which I take to be that of the Western and even some African
              | elites – has come about. They are very different books. David Coltart’s
              | volume uses autobiography to explore the bitter disappointments of
              | Zimbabwean history. In contrast, Michael Bratton’s book explains the
              | Zimbabwean impasse by drawing upon the literature on power sharing
              | and institutional change. They will almost certainly be able to engage
              | rather different audiences. Coltart’s account will have more popular
              | appeal, while Bratton’s will draw more academic attention. Furthermore,
              | whilst Coltart – sustained by his Christian faith – remains (perversely?)
              | optimistic about the future of Zimbabwe, Bratton’s realist approach is
              | considerably gloomier. Even so, despite their differences, these contri-
              | butions complement each other nicely. Both are consumed by key ques-
              | tions: How can Zimbabwe grapple with its history and resolve its appar-
              | ently intractable conflicts? What prospect is there for some sort of tran-
              | sitional justice? Is there any realistic chance of transitioning to democ-
              | racy? There is no originality in these questions. They are of concern to all
              | those who have an abiding interest in Zimbabwe. However, both books
              | add considerably to the richness of debate. After a brief review of their
              | content, I will discuss how they address these issues.
              | Bratton: The Dynamics of Power Politics
              | Bratton “analyzes the resilience of authoritarian rule in Zimbabwe through
              | the lenses of power politics and elite political settlements” (10). By cap-
              | turing the state, leaders have been able to entrench lasting arrangements to
              | exercise power, never hesitating to use violence and defy the rule of law.
              | “Power politics” he borrows from the realist tradition of international
              | relations, “which views states as locked in blunt competition to achieve
              | self-defined national interests in the absence of overarching external au-
              | thority” (7), choosing to apply it to the domestic rather than the inter-
              | national arena. While Thomas Hobbes might well protest that Mugabe’s
              | particular conceit is that he embodies the sovereign, Bratton eschews any
              | such emphasis upon a “big man,” providing an alternative emphasis on the
              | broader civilian–military elite coalition which surrounds the president
              | (235). So even when, at critical junctures, such sovereign elites feel com-
              | History, Tyranny, and Democracy in Zimbabwe
meta          | 119
text          | pelled by circumstance to enter into more inclusive pacts with rivals, they
              | do their best to undermine these pacts and to return to the status quo ante.
              | Beyond his explanation of power politics, Bratton organises the
              | book into four parts. First, distinguishing between “power capture,”
              | “power sharing,” and “power division,” he provides overviews of the
              | different political settlements which have defined Zimbabwean politics.
              | The colonial political settlement, which favoured a small white minority,
              | went through different iterations: rule by the British South Africa Com-
              | pany; settler rule under authority delegated from Westminster; settler
              | rebellion; and, finally, the Lancaster House independence settlement,
              | whereby Britain brokered a compromise between the settler regime and
              | African liberation movements, granting majority rule in return for guar-
              | antees of property and economic continuity. However, under this settle-
              | ment (1980), ZANU-PF’s drive for exclusive power saw it waging ethno-
              | cidal war against its internal rival, Joshua Nkomo’s Zimbabwe African
              | People’s Union (ZAPU), and violently cajoling the latter into collapsing
              | itself into the ruling party in 1987. Subsequently, in the wake of escalat-
              | ing economic and political crises, ZANU-PF was to be bundled into a
              | power-sharing arrangement with a new rival, the Movement for Demo-
              | cratic Change (MDC), in 2008. Bratton characterises these settlements as
              | “elite pacts” rather than “social contracts,” with elite interests continu-
              | ously predominating. All of them have been built upon “manipulation of
              | the law, economic exclusion, political intimidation, covert operations,
              | and […] physical violence” (7).
              | In Part 2, Bratton goes beyond other accounts of the post-2008 pe-
              | riod by placing the MDC–ZANU-PF coalition in a cross-national, African
              | context. Power sharing between rival elites was implemented relatively
              | successfully to end settler rule in South Africa and civil war in Sierra
              | Leone. However, it was far less successful in Kenya. Although it brought a
              | momentary halt to violence following the disputed presidential elections of
              | 2007, it enabled a president (Kibaki) to retain power despite having pos-
              | sibly lost the election. Indeed, the coalition period failed to address the
              | deep structural domination long enjoyed by the Kikuyu elite (118). Bratton
              | concludes that whereas in South Africa and Sierra Leone political adver-
              | saries saw advantages in resolving differences by talking rather than
              | fighting, in Kenya, and as he goes on to detail, in Zimbabwe, power shar-
              | ing was used by incumbent elites to regroup and recapture the state.
              | In Part 3, Bratton turns to fundamental reforms that he considers
              | necessary for countries to resolve intractable domestic conflicts. In the
              | Zimbabwean case, he refers to constitution making, election manage-
              | ment, security sector reform, and transitional justice. The first three of
meta          | 120
text          | Roger Southall
              | these have already received considerable attention, there being wide
              | consensus that for Zimbabwe to make progress towards democracy, it
              | needs a fully inclusive constitutional settlement, it needs elections to be
              | independently managed, and it needs civilian control to be asserted over
              | the military. How to achieve these worthy ends is a more difficult matter,
              | and Bratton’s commentaries (for instance, that the best hope for profes-
              | sionalisation of the military lies simply in the passing of the generation
              | which fought the liberation war) are as sensible as any. Most valuable,
              | however, is his discussion of the need and prospects for transitional
              | justice, to which I turn in more detail below.
              | His concluding Part 4 attempts to reflect upon the implications of
              | the Zimbabwean case for theory about power sharing and institutional
              | change for policymakers, and not least, the Zimbabwean people. He had
              | the advantage of writing after the 2013 election, when although ZANU-
              | PF undoubtedly engaged in its customary chicanery, it nonetheless won a
              | renewed mandate, despite popular awareness of its past oppressions. In
              | the 2013 election, Bratton suggests, many people voted for ZANU-PF
              | simply because they feared that its rejection would result in a renewal of
              | political violence and conflict (244). In turn, he holds out little hope that
              | leadership succession within the ruling party will lead to a more liberal
              | social compact. Until that time, “the people of Zimbabwe will likely opt
              | for social peace and stability, rather than transitional justice or even
              | democratic liberty” (245).
              | Coltart: The Struggle against Tyranny
              | Coltart’s volume is prefaced by an impressive number of endorsements by
              | the great and the good. The one I like the most was penned by David
              | Blair, chief foreign correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, who describes
              | Coltart’s book as “an extended love letter to Zimbabwe,” citing the au-
              | thor’s introductory comments, where he writes of Zimbabwe’s “moun-
              | tains, rivers, savannah plains, teak forests, rich soils, abundant water,” and
              | so on, along with “some of the most literate, hardworking, and kindest
              | people on the planet.” Although he acknowledges that Zimbabwe’s history
              | has been tumultuous, he is nonetheless “more than ever enthralled by this
              | great nation.” What Zimbabwe needs, he argues, is democracy – “a new
              | birth of freedom in which government of the people, by the people, and
              | for the people is cherished” (xiv). This is obviously endearing stuff. Yet it
              | also embodies an acute contradiction: How did “the kindest people on the
              | planet” give rise to such a brutally authoritarian post-independence re-
              | History, Tyranny, and Democracy in Zimbabwe
meta          | 121
text          | gime? It is this contradiction that Coltart seeks to unravel, albeit in a man-
              | ner more personal and less analytical than Bratton.
              | Coltart’s outline of Zimbabwe’s historical trajectory, tracing the
              | country’s movement from racial to liberation-movement authoritarian-
              | ism is not original in itself. It has been traced many times before. How-
              | ever, what is original is the extensive detail and insider knowledge of
              | many events and processes. For a start, Coltart’s account is utterly com-
              | pelling, even for those already soaked in Zimbabwean history. In partic-
              | ular, he has rendered a major service by providing details of disappear-
              | ances, arrests, incarcerations, cases of torture, persecutions, prosecutions
              | – and, too often, murders – of numerous victims of the regime. Such
              | evils are of course valuably aggregated by civil society organisations such
              | as Amnesty International, but Coltart refers to the individuals involved,
              | for many of whom he served as a lawyer. For the families of such victims
              | as much as the victims themselves, it is important to have their names
              | inscribed into history. Further, in telling these individual stories, Coltart
              | weaves a fascinating account of how a relatively small number of indi-
              | viduals – lawyers, activists, pastors, liberal whites and Africans alike, and
              | so on – worked to expose and counter regime oppression. Lawyers will
              | be gratified that even in situations where the law, judges, and the courts
              | had been largely suborned by the state, legal processes could sometimes
              | result in unexpectedly favourable outcomes. They will be less impressed,
              | however, by the need for even distinguished lawyers like Coltart and
              | other opponents of the regime who defend individuals in the courts to
              | take extreme measures to preserve their personal safety, ranging from
              | the wearing of bulletproof jackets to the necessity of packed suitcases in
              | case of arrest, along with the importance of “safe houses” for the pro-
              | tection of their families. This account joins others (e.g. Todd 2007) in
              | reminding us very forcibly of the immense courage it has taken to op-
              | pose vicious repression in Zimbabwe. In Coltart’s case, he could easily
              | have emigrated – but rather than take the easy route out, he deliberately
              | gave up his British citizenship, thereby making it more difficult for the
              | regime to expel him.
              | Any attempt to summarise Coltart’s account would be foolhardy, so
              | I will simply focus upon three aspects of it which I feel are of particular
              | value. The first is that it contributes to the growing literature (such as
              | Godwin 1996) on “white Rhodesia.” Coltart is searingly honest in his
              | account of how, as a politically callow youth, he opted to do his national
              | service rather than flee. Ian Smith’s government had decreed that, upon
              | turning 18, all boys should do their service immediately after school
              | (previously they had been allowed to attend university first). Despite the
meta          | 122
text          | Roger Southall
              | strong reservations of his parents, who opposed Smith and wanted their
              | son to avoid the draft, Coltart took the view of the white majority that it
              | was cowardly not to defend the country in the face of a “communist”
              | threat. For Coltart, therefore, “national service was a necessary evil to
              | secure a smooth, gradual transition to majority rule rather than a revolu-
              | tion” (53).
              | Coltart signed up for the police for three years, and he describes his
              | involvement in anti-guerrilla activities in detail. Yet it was while he was
              | with the police that he began to change. As a totally inexperienced of-
              | ficer, he found himself heavily dependent upon black subordinates, who
              | were more competent than he was. Over time, too, he was to become
              | increasingly disillusioned by the methods used to combat “terrorists,”
              | (although he equally deplored the brutalities of the other side). Ulti-
              | mately, this led to his leaving the police early and heading for undergrad-
              | uate studies in law at the University of Cape Town (UCT). There he
              | mixed initially with other conservative “Rhodies” before a Damascene
              | conversion to active (as opposed to nominal) Christianity and commu-
              | nity work in the Crossroads squatter camp, along with exposure to UCT
              | liberalism, brought about a transformation in his views. Following the
              | 1980 election, Coltart committed to returning to a new, more inclusive
              | Zimbabwe. It was there, as a fully fledged lawyer, that he was to become
              | drawn into the networks of activists, including that of former prime
              | minister Garfield Todd and his daughter Judith, which emerged in de-
              | fence of human rights as the Mugabe regime cranked up its assaults
              | upon its opponents.
              | Fast-forward to the early 2000s, and there is valuable material on
              | the early development of the MDC, which Coltart joined only after he
              | had been invited to become its secretary for legal affairs. Soon he was
              | heavily involved in both the MDC’s call for a “no” vote in the 2000
              | referendum on ZANU-PF’s proposed new constitution and the MDC’s
              | subsequent campaign in the 2000 elections, the latter conducted amidst a
              | reign of terror by ZANU-PF. Standing as the MDC candidate in his
              | home town of Bulawayo, Coltart was elected to parliament by a sweep-
              | ing majority. Overall, however, with many of its supporters (notably in
              | rural areas) subjected to extreme violence, the MDC was denied victory.
              | So it was that Coltart became caught up in the maelstrom of opposition
              | politics, much of it concerning how parliamentary, media, and legal cam-
              | paigning should relate to mass action. This was to involve him in all sorts
              | of legal tangles with ZANU-PF. It also brought him and the MDC up
              | against unwelcome regional realities, such as South Africa’s and the
              | SADC’s backing of the result of the 2005 election, in which once again
              | History, Tyranny, and Democracy in Zimbabwe
meta          | 123
text          | ZANU-PF had trashed virtually all of the SADC’s own electoral guide-
              | lines. “History had come full circle. Just as the Nationalists had allowed
              | the RF to frustrate the democratic will of the people, the ANC was do-
              | ing the same for ZANU-PF” (419).
              | Of particular interest is Coltart’s account of how the MDC began to
              | unravel into rival factions in the wake of that election. Increasingly, there
              | were youth members of the MDC who wanted to return fire with fire,
              | and were impatient that the party’s involvement in parliamentary pro-
              | cesses had changed nothing. While Coltart insisted that it was the MDC’s
              | commitment to non-violence which had consistently distinguished it
              | from ZANU-PF, party leader Morgan Tsvangirai was more equivocal.
              | Subsequently, latent tensions became overt when the party split around
              | whether to participate in the 2005 Senate elections (the Senate having
              | been arbitrarily reinvented after prior abolition in 1989). Despite vigor-
              | ous efforts by Coltart to broker a peace, the breach was confirmed in
              | January 2006, when the MDC broke into two factions, one (the majority)
              | led by Tsvangirai (MDC-T), the other by Gibson Sibanda, who was soon
              | replaced by Arthur Mutambara (MDC-M). Initially undecided on which
              | faction to join, Coltart’s mind was made up by revelations made to him
              | that MDC operatives were being trained in South Africa. Although it was
              | not clear whether the training was defensive or offensive, weapons were
              | clearly involved. Apart from his own personal commitment to non-vio-
              | lence, he regarded this as likely to invite an even harder crackdown by
              | ZANU-PF on its opponents (440–441).
              | The division of the MDC was to chronically weaken the opposition
              | starting in the 2008 parliamentary elections. Although together the two
              | MDCs won a majority (MDC-T [99] + MDC-M [10] v. ZANU-PF [97]),
              | the divide caused them to lose the Senate and denied them a larger ma-

              | when the MDC-M opted to back ZANU-PF rebel Simba Makoni (8.3
              | per cent) rather than Tsvangirai (47.9 per cent), this – if the official re-
              | sults are to be believed (which actually they are not!) – depriving the
              | latter of an absolute majority over Mugabe, forcing him under the elec-
              | toral rules into a run-off election. Coltart confirms that security person-
              | nel thereupon resorted to extreme levels of violence to keep Mugabe in
              | power, which ultimately forced Tsvangirai to pull out of the campaign to
              | protect the safety of his supporters (476–477).
              | There is much detail provided about the formation of the power-

              | head the Ministry of Education. His account of how he managed to

              | restore the schools system to something resembling functionality has its
              | own interest, but for most, the real value will lie in his description of the
              | workings of the coalition. How ZANU-PF ministers were clearly in awe
              | of Mugabe; how senior civil servants undermined MDC ministers; how
              | too many MDC ministers became seduced by the spoils of office; and
              | how Coltart perceived distinctions between hardline ZANU-PF minis-
              | ters, who were cynically exploiting the Government of National Unity
              | (GNU), and “moderates” (led by Vice President Joice Mujuru), with
              | whom he could work. Ultimately, of course, this was to no avail, for as
              | the 2013 election was looming, it became clear that ZANU-PF was in-
              | tent on manipulating the electoral process – something it achieved with
              | resounding success.
              | Two further points: First, Coltart’s account gives copious detail of
              | his continuous travels overseas, his easy access to high foreign quarters,
              | and the numerous linkages that existed between civil society organisa-
              | tions and with foreign funders. Although this exposed ZANU-PF’s op-
              | ponents to accusations of imperialism, it speaks to the importance of
              | external support for civil society where political space is being closed
              | down. Second, a cruel criticism which may be made of Coltart is that he
              | paints himself as Tarzan in Africa. Let us concede that he is not immod-
              | est! However, the more important point is that we need far more, not
              | fewer, memoirs by holders of high offices in Africa. Penning autobiog-
              | raphies is the staple activity of retired politicians in the West. In Africa,
              | too few retire, and even fewer write, leaving gaping holes in African
              | history (see Tsvangirai 2011 for a relevant exception).
              | Zimbabwean History: Have Opportunities
              | Been Missed?
              | There is a case for counter-factual history if it points to how, at critical
              | junctures, choices were made which altered a country’s long term histori-
              | cal trajectory. In the case of Zimbabwe, these two books pose the ques-
              | tion of whether things might have been different had the liberal open-
              | ings under Garfield Todd in the 1950s not occurred and had the coali-
              | tion government after 2008 not been displaced.
              | Coltart admits to Garfield Todd, prime minister from 1953 to 1958,
              | being one of his heroes. His vision had been one of “a moderate, toler-
              | ant, and democratic Zimbabwe” (359). As prime minister he had intro-
              | duced major reforms aimed at improving the education of the black
              | majority and made progress towards extending political rights to blacks.
              | However, such moves lost him the confidence of his cabinet, and he was
              | History, Tyranny, and Democracy in Zimbabwe
meta          | 125
text          | forced out of office. Todd was “hardly a liberal in the Western sense,”
              | yet nonetheless, “he was also a visionary and a man way ahead of his
              | time” (13).
              | There can be no quarrel with the view that Todd – who was to play
              | an honourable role in protesting human rights abuses under both Smith
              | and Mugabe – deserves all the plaudits he gets. But did his ousting in
              | 1958 really change the course of history? To be fair, Coltart does not
              | explicitly say so, but his yearning that history might have worked out
              | differently if Todd’s rule had been allowed to run its course is very evi-
              | dent: “greater liberty and economic development might have been
              | achieved had war been avoided” (597). Along those lines, he sees strong
              | continuities between settler and liberation-movement rule: “Rhodes
              | begat Smith and Smith begat Mugabe” (599). Ultimately, therefore, Col-
              | tart’s regrets about missed opportunities give way to realism, and an
              | appreciation of the racially polarising dynamics of settler rule (14–19).1
              | Bratton gives short shrift to any idea of a lost liberal moment in
              | settler politics. Indeed, he quotes Colin Leys’ 1959 assessment that the
              | dependence of the settler community upon its control of the state for its
              | presence in the country “precluded the possibility that the power would
              | be voluntarily shared with the rest of the population” (41). Colonial
              | domination, Bratton insists, started and ended with political violence, the
              | short-lived “internal settlement,” headed by Abel Muzorewa (1978–
              | 1980), constituting nothing more than a last ditch attempt by settlers to
              | rule through conservative black agents (34). Subsequently, although the
              | Lancaster House settlement was politically inclusive, it was externally
              | driven, lacked local buy-in, and failed to overcome the racial divide.
              | Furthermore, ZANU-PF was to establish its hegemony and hence read-
              | ily appropriate the authoritarian legacy of the colonial state.
              | Coltart has no doubts that the decision by the two MDCs to enter
              | the coalition government with ZANU-PF following the 2008 elections
              | was the right thing to do. Given a collapsed economy, hyperinflation and
              | the alarming breakout of a cholera epidemic, Zimbabwe was “in more
              | danger than ever of becoming a failed state” (485). Although heavy po-

              | at length by Holderness (1985), one of Todd’s MPs. His account offers a valu-
              | able reminder that some Rhodesian whites were genuinely liberally inclined.
              | However, it is ultimately unconvincing, if only because Todd would never have

              | (Defence, Security, and Justice), Bratton contends that no option re-
              | mained but to execute the Global Political Agreement (GPA) that had
              | been agreed upon in September 2008, despite Mugabe having unilaterally
              | breached many of its key provisions. Coltart was wary of working with
              | ZANU-PF ministers when they had been responsible for so much suf-
              | fering, but there were no other “peaceful, non-violent” alternatives at
              | hand. The constructive work which he was subsequently enabled to do at
              | the Ministry of Education leaves him convinced that participation in the
              | GNU was “the right thing to do” (485). Yet when he subsequently lost
              | his seat at the next election, his dominant emotion was relief (577). Intra-
              | MDC squabbling and brazen trampling over the coalition agreement by
              | ZANU-PF had allowed disillusion to set in. When, subsequently (after
              | the 2013 election), Mugabe dismissed Joice Mujuru, “any hope that the
              | moderates would prevail within ZANU-PF was dashed” (585), and Zim-
              | babwe’s prospects looked as grim as ever.
              | Bratton concurs that the MDCs had little option unless they were
              | prepared to return to the wilderness of opposition politics. Offering a
              | careful analysis of the intense pressures placed upon both the MDCs and
              | ZANU-PF by the SADC and the AU, he points out the very different
              | incentives on offer. To the MDCs, second prize though it was, the coali-
              | tion offered a foot in the door to state power and the possibility of fur-
              | ther political reform. For ZANU-PF, it promised an easing of diplomatic
              | isolation and an inflow of resources to arrest the country’s economic free
              | fall. Above all, however, “the GNU bought time to circle the wagons,
              | restock the treasury (and the armory), and prepare to recapture state
              | power” (138). He also notes the critical fact that the settlement was a
              | political deal which failed to assert civilian control over the military. Con-
              | sequently, ZANU-PF entered the coalition period with a reserved do-
              | main of power: the security complex, impenetrable to reformers, which
              | was “dead set against any transition to democracy or the rule of law”
              | (139). They would prove “military spoilers” who, enjoying direct access
              | to plentiful diamond revenues, exerted a veto over political reform. Con-
              | sequently, whereas the colonial political settlement had been “durable
              | but illegitimate,” the GNU was, in the mind of its most powerful partici-
              | pants, only an interim arrangement (141).
              | It may be argued that Bratton is a beneficiary of hindsight while
              | Coltart and his MDC colleagues had to grapple with what actions to take
              | when confronted by hugely circumscribed options. In essence, as argued
              | elsewhere (for example, Southall 2013), the MDC was between a rock
              | and a hard place, and would probably have drawn extensive retrospective
              | criticism if it had not entered the coalition. Nonetheless, for all that Col-

meta          | 127
text          | tart remains convinced that the MDCs were correct to join the coalition,
              | he also provides ample evidence that they failed to maximise even their
              | limited opportunities. Rivalry between leading personalities allowed
              | ZANU-PF to stoke division between the two MDCs, blunting their effec-
              | tiveness. This led ultimately to their competing against each other in the
              | 2013 election (always particularly damaging to minority parties under first-
              | past-the-post electoral systems). Coltart suggests that had the two MDCs
              | been able to come to some agreement, then the logical option – given
              | ZANU-PF’s blatant manipulation of the electoral regulations – would
              | have been to withdraw from the election, thereby compelling the SADC to
              | hold ZANU-PF to account. As it was, their failure to agree meant that
              | neither could withdraw from the election for fear of giving the other
              | credibility (571). In short, if this was a lost opportunity, the MDCs were
              | significantly to blame.
              | Tackling Tyranny: Dealing with the Past
              | for a Better Future
              | There is surprisingly little literature on transitional justice in Zimbabwe,
              | despite the fact that, under the terms of the GPA, the GNU established
              | the Organ for National Healing, Reconciliation, and Integration (see
              | Benyera 2014; Ndlovu-Gatsheni and Benyera 2015; Ngwenya and Harris
              | 2015). Perhaps this is because, however great the need for a serious
              | national conversation about such issues, there is simultaneously a recog-
              | nition that the time is not ripe for any such debate to lead to meaningful
              | measures. In essence, there is popular as well as academic recognition
              | that power politics has always prevailed in Zimbabwe and continues to
              | do so. Bratton labels this “A History of Impunity,” with both colonial
              | and postcolonial regimes granting sweeping amnesties to human rights
              | abusers (218). Yet this does not mean that the need to have such a con-
              | versation goes away; for this reason, the contributions of both Coltart
              | and Bratton are to be warmly welcomed.
              | Coltart identifies the cult of war pursued by both colonial and post-
              | colonial regimes as having poisoned Zimbabwe’s entire society. In Zim-
              | babwe, he argues, many political protagonists are continuing to fight the
              | liberation war, as if independence never happened. The wounds of that
              | struggle have continued to fester, and while this does not justify the
              | gross abuses of human rights which have taken place since 1980, it may
              | help to explain them. “Until we have some process to enable us all to
              | come to terms with our past, our past will continue to haunt us” (596).
              | While there will be those who contest his view that the war of the 1970s
meta          | 128
text          | Roger Southall
              | was avoidable, there will be much wider agreement that the tragedy of
              | contemporary Zimbabwe violence “has become an acceptable means of
              | resolving domestic political problems” (597). Unfortunately, however,
              | having highlighted the problem, save for asserting the need for the na-
              | tion to come to terms with its past if democracy and development are to
              | be achieved, he offers little indication of how it might be tackled.
              | By contrast, Bratton provides us with chapter and verse of how
              | sweeping amnesties have been provided to those who have committed
              | atrocities by both the colonial and postcolonial regimes. This approach
              | was confirmed by the Lancaster House settlement, which pardoned com-
              | batants from both sides of the independence war, effectively pre-empting
              | prosecutions or any official process to document the truth. Although
              | justified as a means to achieve national reconciliation, this allowed for no
              | moral reckoning, and denied justice to victims and survivors of human
              | rights abuses. With many perpetrators of violence in the war taking up
              | positions in the new government, including the security forces, the cycle
              | of impunity was reinforced. Most notoriously, a Commission of Inquiry
              | into the Matabeleland Disturbances (the “Gukurahundi”) – which was
              | established under international pressure – issued a report that was never
              | published, and the government never made any acknowledgement of its
              | culpability, not to mention offering any redress. This is the way it has
              | been, with political violence becoming systematically deployed as an in-
              | strument of government, notably during elections, while perpetrators
              | have no fear of prosecution but every expectation of impunity.
              | Is there any way out of this cycle? Bratton provides us with an ex-
              | emplary overview of the dilemmas of transitional justice (the trade-offs
              | between morality and politics) and the mechanisms which have been used
              | internationally and in Africa to achieve it (prosecutions, truth commis-
              | sions, amnesty, and mixed models). However, he comes to the conclu-
              | sion – citing how the institutions established under the GNU to promote
              | national reconciliation and human rights were stymied by lack of re-
              | sources and clear mandates – that there is little immediate prospect of
              | securing prosecutions or establishing a functional truth commission.
              | Although he hails the important work done by Zimbabwean NGOs in
              | providing relief to victims and gathering evidence against perpetrators of
              | violence for further use, he asserts that “the political reality of militarized
              | authoritarianism in Zimbabwe means some measure of transitional jus-
              | tice may have to be denied or at least deferred” (227). Interestingly, he
              | cites survey data demonstrating that while consistent majorities of re-
              | spondents wanted violators to be punished, and supporters of the coun-
              | try’s democratic movement vigorously oppose any suggestion of a fur-

text          | ther blanket amnesty, generally Zimbabweans are realists. While the old
              | guard of power politicians remains in place, they opt for peace over
              | justice (226–227). Transitional justice must therefore await democracy.
              | But, realistically, what are the prospects for democracy?
              | Democracy: Damned or Delayed?
              | Coltart agrees with Bratton that Zimbabweans, having borne the brunt
              | of war and violence, have pragmatically opted for peace rather than con-
              | frontation. Support for war and violence has “never gained traction
              | among the vast majority of Zimbabweans” (notwithstanding, apparently,
              | those in the MDC whose desire to return ZANU-PF fire with fire so
              | dismayed Coltart during the mid-2000s). For Coltart, therefore, non-
              | violent struggle would seem to represent not just a moral imperative but
              | politically and pragmatically the only viable way to challenge ZANU-PF.
              | Furthermore, rather than awaiting another messiah (whether a Tsvangirai
              | or a Mujuru), Zimbabweans will need to place policy and principle ahead
              | of personality if they wish to see a democratic dawn (600–601).
              | We should concede that some hope of utopia is necessary if politi-
              | cal activism is to be sustained in seemingly impossible situations. But
              | what are the realistic prospects of making progress towards democracy?
              | Bratton provides some concluding thoughts that are simultaneously trite,
              | in that they are so obvious, and profound, in that Zimbabwean demo-
              | crats will only ignore them at their cost. (We may add that they are easier
              | said than done). Reflecting on the “decisive defeat” of the opposition in
              | 2013, Bratton urges the MDC or successor political parties to realise that
              | political cohabitation with an entrenched incumbent will only undermine
              | opposition leaderships; there is need for ongoing party organisation,
              | especially in rural areas; opposition parties cannot afford factionalism,
              | and smaller parties should coalesce; even if external parties initiate a
              | power-sharing agreement, they will not push hard for political reform if
              | they do not feel the opposition is able to provide political order and
              | stability. For their part, civil society organisations need to put down
              | further roots into society, especially outside urban areas if they are to
              | offer education and hope that counters ZANU-PF hegemony. Finally, he
              | says, “the future of the country lies in the hands of the long-suffering
              | people of Zimbabwe” (244).
              | If the bad news is that the 2013 election indicated the Zimbabwean
              | people felt the opposition parties had failed them, the good news is that
              | they have given ample indication in the past – above all, at the time of

              | movements for change when they believe the moment is opportune.
              | Coltart’s valedictory call (601) is that the struggle for democracy con-
              | tinues. Bratton concurs, but convincingly argues that victory is far from
              | certain, and that even if attainable, is likely to be much delayed.
