              | Abstract: The work presented in this paper traces the history of active learning and further
              | utilizes the available literature to define meaning and importance of active learning in higher
              | education. The study highlights common practical problems faced by students and instructors in
              | implementing active learning in higher education and further identifies a set of individual prac-
              | tices being used worldwide to overcome the obstacles. Expectations and responsibilities of stu-
              | dents and instructors are also specified to enhance the efficiency of active learning environment.
              | The paper also traces the importance of student and instructor rapport for a successful learning
              | environment.
              | Keywords: Active learning, higher education, problem based learning.
              | 1. Introduction
              | Can a person expect to get a car driving license just by attending the theoretical classes? Let us
              | hypothetically assume the person manages to get a license, but will he be able to drive the car? No.
              | To be a perfect car driver a person has to and does take real life driving classes. He develops new
              | skills by actually driving along with the trainer.
              | Higher education aims at an optimal blend of knowledge and skills. It provides a license to the
              | student for driving successfully through the maze of what, when, why, who and how. Usually the
              | next step after higher education is a professional career. This is why role and importance of active
              | learning, and not passive learning (in which an instructor depends solely or predominantly on
              | passive lectures), is crucial throughout higher education.
              | 2. Active learning
              | Roots of active learning can be traced to Confucius (551-479 BC), who stated, “I hear and I
              | forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand”. Socrates (470-399 BC) had similar views
              | when he said that "I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think".
              | Dale (1969) established following relationships between level of involvement of learner and how
              | much the learner remembers:- “We remember: 10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, 30%
              | of what we see, 50% of what we hear and see, 70% of what we say 90% of what we do”.
              | Studies show that classroom attention-span of students varies from 15 to 25 minutes (Bligh, 1972
              | as cited by Cashin, 1985). Meyers & Jones (1993) found that students’ classroom attention is poor
              | for 40% of the time and they retain 70% of the information during the first ten minutes and only
              | 20% of the information during the last ten minutes of a lecture. In a 1997 national survey in USA,
              | of more than 250,000 freshmen at nearly 500 universities, 35.6% of the students said that they
              | were frequently bored in class. (Berk, 2003)
              | All these facts stress on the need of active learning environment in particular when, feedback
              | from students has shown that passive lecture in higher education is not a preferred method of
              | learning. (Sander et al., 2000 as cited by Huxman, 2005)
              | 2.1 Active Learning: Defined
              | Literature review highlighted the following characteristics of active learning.
              | - Learning is enhanced by involving the student in activities and relationships, inside and
              | outside the classroom. (Astin, 1984)
              | - “Lectures are not well suited to higher levels of learning: application, analysis, synthesis,
              | influencing attitudes or values. Lecturing is best suited to the lower levels of knowledge and
              | understanding.” (Cashin, 1985)
              | - “Learning is not a spectator sport. Students do not learn much just by sitting in classes
              | listening to teachers, memorizing pre-packaged assignments, and spitting out answers. They
              | must talk about what they are learning, write about it, relate it to past experiences and apply
              | it to their daily lives.” (Chickering & Gamson, 1987)
              | - Higher-order thinking through analysis, synthesis and evaluation is more important than
              | reading, writing and discussing. (Bonwell & Eison, 1991)
              | - “Active learning involves providing opportunities for students to meaningfully talk and listen,
              | write, read, and reflect on the content, ideas, issues and concerns of an academic subject.”
              | (Meyers & Jones, 1993)
              | - “Although humans appreciate the common and the familiar, and often resist change, the
              | brain seeks and reacts to innovative occurrences.” (Angelo, 1991 as cited by Forrest, 2004)
              | - “In fact, rote learning (e.g., memorizing terminology) is frustrating because the brain resists
              | meaningless stimuli.” (Forrest, 2004)
              | Thus we may derive following definition:-
              | Active learning involves designing, implementing, maintaining and promoting, within and outside
              | classroom, environment for learning, through creating opportunities for active engagement with
              | the subject matter. It strives for higher-order thinking and in-depth comprehension of the learner.
              | 2.2 Active Learning: Drawbacks
              | Active involvement and interaction of the students translate into loss of teaching time as
              | substantial classroom time is spent on multiple questioning and feedback sessions, (Lammers &
              | Murphy, 2002 as cited by Huxman, 2005) especially while handling large classes.(Bonwell, C. &
              | J. Eison, 1991) It results into lesser content coverage in the classroom. (Murray & Brightman,
              | 1996 as cited by Huxman, 2005). But the biggest roadblock is a creation of the instructor himself
              | and that is fear of failure, fear of loss of control due to enhanced classroom discussions, fear of
              | lack of student participation, and fear of criticism of a new method. (Bonwell, C. & J. Eison, 1991)
              | 2.2.1 Handling drawbacks: Short Lectures
              | An analysis of research papers on higher education by Chilcoat (1989) found that, continuous
              | rapid lecturing happens at a rate of 120 to 240 words per minute but most of the students can
              | write down only 20 words per minute. Result is half cooked notes and poor understanding during
              | lecture time.
              | A solution to the above problem can be found in a study conducted by Ruhl et al. (1987), in which
              | the instructor paused for two minutes for three times during a lecture, and during these pauses
              | students worked in pairs to re-discuss the topic discussed by the instructor and then reworked on
              | their class notes to fill up the gaps left while taking down the notes during lecture. During the
              | pauses students did not engage in discussion with the instructor. At the end of the lecture three
              | minutes were given to let the students write down their free recall. Results proved that short
              | lectures of 12 to 18 minutes followed by pauses for student interaction enhance students’ learning.
              | Bonwell and Eison (1991), suggest to conduct guided lecture in which instructor lectures
              | continuously for 20 to 30 minutes without the students taking notes and then allots five minutes
              | for free recall writing by the students followed by small groups of students discussing and
              | analyzing the topic.
              | 2.2.2 Handling drawbacks: Revised lecture information density
              | Russell et al. (1984) conducted a research on 123 medical students and divided them into three
              | groups with no significant difference in cumulative GPA’s. First group was exposed to high
              | density lecture with 90% new content, second group was exposed to medium density lecture with
              | 70% new content and third to low density lecture with 50% new content. In each lecture the
              | remaining time was spent on reinforcing the core ideas by actively involving the students and by
              | relating the content to prior experience. Tests after the lectures confirmed that learning and
              | retention was higher with low density content.
              | Fedler & Brent (1996) suggest to discuss only core, critical and difficult topics in class, to give
              | brief writing assignments to the students on the self covered topics and then to test the students on
              | those topics. Wilke (2003) conducted a research on 141 students in human physiology and
              | found that active learning improved students’ content achievement even when the content is
              | reduced. Research had proved time and again that reduced lecture time and reduced lecture
              | information density enhances learning.
              | 2.2.3 Handling drawbacks: Expectations and responsibilities
              | Lesser lecture time in the classroom and lower density content should not lead to lower
              | expectations of the students or instructor. Chickering & Gamson (1987) suggest “expect more and
              | you will get more”. Seeler et al. (1994) suggests that active learning environment does not mean
              | structure less learning environment and it does not mean undermining the importance of theory.
              | Active learning environment not only increases the opportunities for interaction and involvement
              | but also responsibilities. Following are some important expectations and responsibilities as
              | suggested by Seeler et al. (1994).
              | Students must be more aware and be ready to be responsible for their own professional
              | development. They must increase their level of involvement in the active learning environment
              | and focus on application of theory to real life practice. But this does not mean that the instructor is
              | less responsible for active learning environment. Seeler et al. (1994) further suggest active
              | learning depends on the success of the instructor in helping the students successfully manage
              | transition from passive style of learning to the new one. Instructor needs to understand ability of
              | the student, develop new skills, be aware of practical applications of theory to design exercises
              | and assignments accordingly, adopt the role of facilitator and mentor. Instructor must rely on
              | feedback and make changes, if necessary.
              | Stinson & Milter (1996) also highlight instructor’s skill development and student transition as two
              | major pillars of active learning environment. They point out that the instructor needs to be an
              | active listener and a coach. So that he can encourage the students to take responsibility of their
              | own learning. This can be done effectively when the instructor gives continuous and prompt
              | feedback to the students. (Chickering & Gamson 1987)
              | 2.2.4 Handling drawbacks: Student and instructor rapport
              | Confucius believed in affection and empathy towards students (Huanyin, Y., 1999). Chickering &
              | Gamson (1987) adviced instructors to “encourage contact between student and faculty”. Tiberius
              | & Billson (Tiberius & Billson, 1991 as cited by Fleming, 2003) emphasized on need of a trust
              | based, open and cooperative relationship between an instructor and his students which is guided,
              | not by control, but by mutual agreement.
              | Active learning demands involvement. Involvement demands interaction. Fruitful interaction
              | demands rapport. But that does not mean that an instructor has to indulge in students’
              | appeasement. He has to rather strive for a growth oriented relationship with sincerity and honesty.
              | 2.3 Co-operative active learning
              | Active learning may be implemented through different routes. One of the popular routes is
              | cooperative active learning. Students’ involvement amongst themselves is crucial for successful
              | active learning environment. As Chickering & Gamson (1987) stated, “learning isn’t solo race
              | rather it’s a team effort which depends on collaboration and cooperation amongst students.” In
              | cooperative learning a class is divided into smaller groups to enhance understanding and learning
              | of students through positive interdependence, individual accountability, continuous interaction,
              | teamwork, to accomplish orderly thinking, problem solving, critical analysis and clear expression
              | (Johnson et al. 1998).
              | Imagine six stand alone desktop computers and now compare it with a group of six networked
              | computers. Which would give higher volume of fast information sharing and processing? Off
              | course the networked group. Cooperative learning aims at developing a network of human brains
              | to achieve higher levels of learning, and to prevent this network from crashing the size of the
              | teams is kept smaller. Student attendance is essential in a cooperative learning environment as
              | absence of one or few team member(s) might disturb the task accomplishment and create a
              | negative impact on the team spirit. (McManus, 1996). Finlay and Faulkner (2005) conducted a
              | project in which self help reading groups of 3-5 students were formed. Each student had to read a
              | different topic each week and then had to write one page synopsis which was later discussed with
              | the group. After the reading students asked questions among themselves. 73% of the students
              | expressed positive perception of the method. Boud et al. (1999) refer to a term “peer learning” in
              | which students learn in a group without intervention of an instructor.
              | Cooperative learning aims at self help in pursuit of knowledge. It may partially involve the
              | instructor or it may be practiced without instructor’s intervention. One logical adaptation would
              | be to initiate cooperative learning with higher degree of instructor’s involvement and intervention
              | and to gradually reduce the involvement after judging the degree of self sufficiency of the group.
              | Cooperative learning may promote social loafing. Latane et al. (1979) in their research found that
              | individuals tend to reduce effort when performing in a group. This is called social loafing. Maniar
              | (2002) researched team work in business and sports and found that individual input reduces with
              | the increase in size of a team. To prevent social loafing he suggests to evaluate each individual on
              | his/her contribution, give smaller awards along the way instead of rewarding the group at the end
              | of the task.
              | 2.4 Assignment based active learning
              | Since 1988, University of Hawai at Manoa has been running “writing intensive” classes which
              | aims at “learning through writing”. (UHM 2006) An internal study has found that students have
              | positive perception of the program and writing intensive assignments enhance learning amongst
              | the students, but they need to be taught how to write to learn. The strategy used by the university
              | is to guide students to improve their analytical skills through synthesis of the journal articles,
              | improve their reading skills through writing summaries, learn data collection techniques , to
              | improve their analytical skills by examining research articles and then to present their own views
              | through writing intensive assignments. Plagiarism may be cited as a big drawback of writing
              | intensive assignments but a software like ‘Turnitin’ (www.turnitin.com) helps to keep a check on
              | students indulging in plagiarism.
              | 2.5 Problem based active learning
              | Problem based learning is a self directed effort of a student towards understanding the solution of
              | a problem. In this process the student identifies what he knows and what he needs to know to
              | solve the problem. (Barrows and Tamblyn 1980) Instead of feeding the students with readymade
              | content through lectures and discussions, problem based learning begins with a challenge of
              | presenting a real life problem through case studies, research papers, assignment etc to the students,
              | the answer to which they have to find on their own, individually and/or collectively. This method
              | drastically changes the role of the students as well as the instructor.
              | The usual practice of teaching is to explain the concept to the students and then follow with
              | questions. Problem based learning (PBL) is exactly opposite as in PBL the beginning is with a
              | problem and in due course of time students acquire knowledge and skills to solve the problem. A
              | teacher is no more a provider of quick and easy answers rather he becomes a facilitator in search
              | of relevant information. The biggest challenge for successful implementation of PBL is the
              | willingness and ability of the instructor to create a learning environment which is not teacher
              | centered and in which the student actively guides his own learning, individually or in a group.
              | (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980).
              | Second most important challenge while implementing PBL is the selection of a problem. Stinson
              | & Milter, (1996) suggest the selected problem should reflect real life circumstances and be
              | contemporary to facilitate the process of learning and doing. They further suggest the problem to
              | be ill-structured, as real life problems are rarely structured. An ill-structured problem would
              | enable the student to comprehend ill defined situations. Duch (1996) insists that an effective
              | problem must engage and motivate students, should be connected to previously learned
              | knowledge, be open ended and not limited to one correct answer, must encourage higher level of
              | learning by asking for solutions based on facts and logic. Duch (1996) further clarifies that instead
              | of dividing the problem into smaller units to be individually solved by a student, an effective
              | problem should encourage total involvement of a students group and prevent “divide and
              | conquer” of the assignment. We may conclude that PBL attempts to bridge the gap between
              | education and research.
              | 3. Multiple intelligence and multi-sense oriented learning.
              | Gardner’s (1993) concept of multiple intelligence identified that each individual has following
              | eight facets of intelligence. Logical-mathematical intelligence makes a learner quick with
              | numbers, strong in reasoning and scientific thinking. Verbal-linguistic makes a learner
              | comfortable with languages and communication including verbal and written assignments etc.
              | Musical-rhythmic intelligence relates to recognition and use of sounds and audio presentations.
              | Naturalist intelligence relates to ability to work with nature, field trips, real life situations. Visual-
              | spatial relates to sense of sight and ability to make mental images and concept maps. Inter-
              | relational relates to inter personal skills such as communication and team work. Intra relational is
              | associated with understanding of self. Bodily-kinesthetic is associated with body movements.
              | Visual based instructions using audio visual models, films, 3D graphs enhance the productivity of
              | active learning environment (Cashin,1985; Bonwell & Eison 1991). VARK (Visual, Aural,
              | Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning strategy attempts to create an active learning environment. In
              | visual learning an instructor uses gestures and picturesque language, pictures, videos, posters,
              | slides, colour flow-charts, colour graphs and diagrams, underlining and different colour
              | highlighters etc.
              | In aural learning classroom discussions between learner and instructor and amongst learner play
              | an important role. Outside classroom strategy involves spending time in a quiet place and
              | recalling the ideas and speaking out the answers aloud or inside head to register the content in
              | mind.
              | Read/write learning strategy works well when the content involves lots of definitions, glossaries,
              | manuals, dictionaries. This strategy requires the students to undertake multiple writing and
              | reading sessions. To reinforce learning frequent multiple choice tests are suggested.
              | In kinesthetic learning strategy field tours and trips, lectures with real life examples, laboratory
              | sessions, learning from trial and error etc is given emphasis. Use of case studies and applications
              | to help with principles and abstract concepts is suggested. (Complete information on VARK
              | adapted from www.vark-learn.com).
              | A comprehensive active learning environment which can successfully engage the learners with
              | consistency will need to address the issues of multiple intelligence and multiple human senses. A
              | multi dimensional communication will strengthen the learning environment. Multiple intelligence
              | identifies different facets of human intelligence, and a successful active learning environment
              | needs to implement variety of tools to address these facets.
              | 4. Conclusion
              | Active learning is more than a technique or a tool. Active learning is a way of life. There are three
              | major components of an active learning environment and they are students, instructors and
              | institute/management. Active learning environment demands behavior modification on the part of
              | students, instructors and institute/management. The speed and intensity of implementing a step
              | by step comprehensive active learning environment in higher education has to be determined by
              | the desire, ability and willingness of the students, instructors and institute/management.
              | Instead of developing and implementing a learning environment which is decided by the
              | management/faculty/consultant, the need identification for an activity based environment in the
              | mindset of the students has to be given importance. There is a need of a paradigm shift from the
              | usual approach of ‘how I like to teach’ to ‘how the learner wants to learn and how the learner will
              | learn better’.
              | Apart from the methods already discussed there are multiple tools to choose from for
              | implementing active learning environment, such as,
              | - Group brainstorming
              | - Think-pair-share (A tool in which students are divided into groups of two and they
              | discuss their understanding of the topic after a short lecture)
              | - One minute papers on the muddiest point, difficult topic, easiest definition etc.
              | - Concept maps (A tool which abets in comprehending the logical relationships amongst a
              | number of ideas within a topic of discussion by creating a visual map of the connections.)
              | - Students role play, simulations.
              | - Short writing assignments/ summaries.
              | - Classroom debates and discussions.
              | One can pick and choose any combination of the methods and tools discussed in this research
              | paper but the selection of a combination has to be guided by the habits, preferences, willingness,
              | behaviour modification, knowledge base and learning style of the students and also the instructors.
              | Following may be considered as prerequisites for a successful active learning environment:
              | 1. Clarity, creativity and likeability of the tools and techniques used
              | 2. Degree (positive) of behaviour modification (engagement and involvement) of the
              | students induced by the tools used.
              | 3. Synergy of active learning environment with the present and required knowledge base of
              | the instructor and learners.
              | 4. Synergy of active learning with course, syllabus and time schedule.
              | 5. Availability of relevant case studies, problems, assignments, tests, related infrastructure.
              | 6. Complete involvement of all the stakeholders: faculty, support staff, institute’s
              | management, students (individually & jointly), and parents.
              | 7. Examination performance enhancement by the tools and techniques used.
              | 8. Within and outside classroom as well as within and outside college, learning continuity.
              | To conclude, active learning would start with an instructor who is an active learner and active
              | instructor himself and who can upgrade his knowledge and skills in the time of need. He has to
              | then identify the needs of the students with reference to changes expected in learning environment.
              | He then has to balance the students needs with what he thinks is best for the learning environment.
              | This would lead to the preliminary preparations in collaboration with the learners and would be
              | followed by gradual, step by step implementation of the new methods and tools.
              | Continuous feedback from the students and supervision by the instructor might be essential at an
              | early stage. Regular evaluation of the learning environment is essential through class tests, viva-
              | voce, evaluation of assignments (by instructor or by students themselves), students’ feedback
              | (informal classroom feedback and/or formal questionnaire based feedback), peer feedback (by
              | instructor’s colleagues).
