              | ABSTRACT
              | Background and Aim: Present research intends to investigate relationship of psychological
              | hardiness with work holism among high school teachers. Methods: The under study society includes all
              | male and female high school teacher in Ghorveh city in the academic year 2012-2013. Using simple
              | random sampling method, a sample size of 100 male and female teachers was selected. To collect data,
              | Kobassa Psychological Hardiness Questionnaire and Aghabeigi Workaholics Questionnaire were
              | employed. To analyze the data, descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, mean and standard
              | deviation) and inferential statistics (t-test and regression analysis) were used. Results: The findings
              | indicated that there is negative and significant relationship between the variables psychological
              | hardiness and work holism. In addition, there is association between gender and psychological hardiness
              | and between gender and work holism, also the constituents of psychological hardiness (commitment,
              | control and challenge) are able to predict work holism.
              | Keywords: psychological hardiness; work holism; gender
              | 1. INTRODUCTION
              | Psychological hardiness is one of the elements which play a basic role in man’s life
              | quality and to create a balance among different dimensions of it .People who have low hardiness
              | will hurt more by harmful elements in long term while people with high hardiness apparently
              | have natural or acquirable security against the stressfulelements. Hardiness is the ability to
              | understand the external conditions accurately and to make a desirable decision about oneself
              | (Jomhari, 2002). Kobasa (1979) introduce the hardiness as a complicated personal characteristic
              | which is formed by three constituents: challenge, control and commitment which are supposed
              | as a set acting as mediators to mediate stress effect as the recognition situation are changing
              | and the stressful facts of life are decreasing (Sabri and Abdkhodai, 2010). Hardiness is mainly
              | relates to the adjustment and positive agreement encountering problems and difficulties
              | (Issacson, 2002). Researchers believe that hardiness and vulnerability are two opposite poles of
              | a same continuum (Fergus and Zemmerman 2005). Other researchers studied common features
              | in people with hardiness includes: higher self-ruling, independency, sympathy, job
              | commitment, endeavor, good problem, solving skills and good relationship with colleagues

              | (Issacson, 2002). Kobasa and Maddi (1982) state that people are very resistant to the mental
              | pressure and under the stressful situations not only don’t hurt mentally but also they welcome
              | them and believe that these situations are necessary for their development in life. Moreover,
              | their studies about companies and graduated students showed that people who have a harden
              | personalities will experience less mental pressure and they will not be threat by mental pressure
              | (Kobasa and Maddi 1982). Researchers indicated that hardiness has a positive relationshipwith
              | physical and mental disorder (Brooks 2003). Considering hardiness as a acquirable feature not
              | mainly an inherent one (lambert 2007). Learning hardiness increase commitment, control and
              | challenge rates, the effects of each separately or in combination can decrease the rate of
              | recognized stress (Nasiri, 2010). Kobasa (1979) believes that it can enforce person ability to
              | control situation ,to commit duties and to encounter events .Various studies have shown that
              | hardiness has a positive relationship with people mental health (Maddi and khoshaba, 1994) ,it
              | decrease stress (Shapperand ;Kashani 1999) and that hardiness has a positive relationship with
              | people physical and mental health (Florian et al 1995).
              | The results of king et al; (1998) showed that people with hardiness evaluate unpleasant
              | situations in a challenging manner than threatening one and have more commitment to
              | themselves and their works and experience more sense of control in their lives. Kobasa (1979)
              | has integrated three attributes:commitment, control and challenge all of which have originated
              | from the existing philosophy. She has described hardiness as a shield against diseases (Jomhari,
              | 2002).
              | This is one of the main aspects of the personal control “personal efficiency”. This concept
              | has been presented by Albert Bandura (1997), people who have this characteristic believe that
              | they can do everything successfully (Majidian, 2004). The challenging people serve life
              | changes as challenges or opportunities to development not as limitations or threats (Kobasa
              | 1979). In addition, people with hardiness undergo less physical erosion in stressful conditions
              | (Majidian, 2004). Work holism forms a great deal of man’s life as well as work engages people
              | in itself both physically and cognitively. However, the business turbulent world exerts
              | numerous pressures on the business owners. Today organizations are dwindling in size and
              | rebuilding that increase expectations and working demands and also it increase working hours
              | (Schaufeli; et al; 2009).The term work holism has been presented first by Oates; 1971. He
              | described this term as an uncontrollable need or obligation and driven to work continuously.
              | This definition involves two constituents:extreme work, extreme tendency; to spend more
              | time to work than what the organization expects them to achieve its goals. The later indicates
              | that work holists always and permanently think about work, even when they are not at work. In
              | other word, work holist’s mind usually engage in affaires relateto the work. These two
              | compartments as the behavioral and cognitive elements of work holism point to the root of the
              | work holism that is just consistent with the alcoholism (Oates 1971). One of the job concepts
              | that have been presented in academic and organizational environments since 1970s is “work
              | holism”. Some researchers equalize work holism with other types of addiction and draw it with
              | unhappy, sad or sensitive forms that person cannot do his work best and cause some problems
              | to his colleagues too (Agha Beigi 2007). It is believed that work holists do work more than what
              | is expected and do more efforts in a way that ignore their lives out of their job. Therefore it
              | should be mentioned that the most evident feature of work holists is that they work more than
              | what is necessary ( Buelens and Palman 2004). In general, work holism is defined as spending
              | a considerable amount of time to work; that is continuous cognitive engagement along with
              | preferring work during leisure time. (snir and Zohar 2008). To differentiate overworking results
              | from correct planning and enough energy, theirdiscrepancies can be considered People who
              | overwork do work as an essential thing and sometimes interpret it as a satisfying duty but work

text          | holists consider their work as a secure shelter by which they can avoid the unwanted
              | commitments and feelings out of the work.
              | They know how and when attend home beside their families and friends completely and
              | participate in its programs, work holists allow their work to have the maximum degree of
              | importance in their lives. They often make commitments because of their work necessities, also
              | people who over work can lose their enthusiasm to work but work holists cannot. Their minds
              | engage in work even when they are at the exercising or recreational activities. These people
              | engage their minds in working problems (Ahmadi et al 2010). Work holism is an unsatisfying
              | kind of need to work during which the following indications are remarkable: like other addicts
              | these people underestimate their working hours and ignore the overall time that they engage
              | themselves in problems relate to the work at home or weekends.
              | These people ignore their spouse and children needs and serve their complaints as seeking
              | excuse or demanding. Depression: Totally, these people don’t feel excitement and liveliness.
              | Reality distortion: In many cases, these patients are actually unaware of what they are doing
              | and think that their unreasonable reactions are reasonable. Reduced self-confidence: Despite
              | remarkable economic successes, these people apparently are powerful and self-confined but
              | mentally they are unstable and weak which is need to control. This is another defending reaction
              | of these people who want to satisfy their absence with excuse seeking when they are attendant.
              | As a satisfactory reaction they are oversensitive to what has happened at home during their
              | absences. Unfortunately, they analyze problems pessimistically (Snir and Harpaz 2006). Scott
              | et al; (1997) also identified three models of workholism include: radical drive (scrupulous),
              | perfectionism and prosperous. In their opinion work holists have a high degree of scruple, stress
              | and anxiety.
              | Their work cause physical and mental problems, they have little satisfaction of their job
              | and lives and their job performance are low. Perfectionist work holists have high level of stress
              | and physical or mental problems, they have hostile and inefficient interrelationships, they have
              | more arbitrary absence and also they have lower job satisfaction and performance. Finally,
              | prosperous work holists have lower life and job satisfaction, physical and mental health, job
              | performance and high organizational citizenship behaviors and lower stress and arbitrary
              | service absence. Regarding the typology of work holism by Spence and Robins (1992) work
              | holism is characterized based on the amount of these three constituents: Feeling of being driven
              | to work, work involvement and work enjoyment. In work holists the rate of feeling of being
              | driven to work is high, they have very high tendency to work but they don’t enjoy it. In contrast,
              | people who are keen to work will engage in it while they feel enjoyment and don’t have an
              | extreme drive. Moreover, they found that work holists experience higher job stress than others.
              | Work holism can have different effects on people psychological and physical health and their
              | relatives. The most common consequences of the work holism is to create a high level of job
              | stress and family-work contradiction; Although the following cases can be mentioned: Increase
              | health threatening indications, job elimination, problems in group working, avoid family
              | relationships, communication problems, low life satisfaction, lack of leisure time enjoyment(
              | Piotrowski and Vodanovich, 2008). However, there have been a few internal and external
              | researches in this area and the author points to some researches in which two concepts of
              | hardiness and addiction are presented as it was specified that work holism itself is a subconcept
              | of addiction in its general form.Snir and Harpaz (2006) suggested that the probability of men
              | works holism is more than women. Mohammad talebi (2008) in has study show the relationship
              | between the organizational culture and work holism, Asgari, Mostafa (2002) has studied the
              | relationship between hardiness and attachment style with the preparation for addiction that he
              | obtained a negative and significant correlation between the hardiness and attachment with
meta          | 4
text          | Volume 5
              | tendency to addiction. Kobasa et al (1982) state that people with hardiness had higher level of
              | job satisfaction, low pressure at work environment and high quality of life compared to the
              | people with low hardiness. Also,the rate of hardiness in men is more than women. Jomhari
              | (2002) has examined the relationship between hardiness and tendency to depression and anxiety
              | among male and female students from Tehran University.
              | Results showed that there is a reverse relationship between hardiness and tendency to
              | depression and anxiety. Rash et al (1995) in his study showed that hardiness has a negative
              | relationship with mental stress at work and it has a positive relationship with job satisfaction
              | (Izakian, 2001). Maddi et al (1996) in his research showed that hardiness has a negative
              | correlation with drug addiction, alcohol in the past and present. Ahadi et al, (2008) in his
              | research studied the rate of hardiness in medical specialized assistances concluded that there is
              | a positive correlation between hardiness and marriage and the mean score of hardiness in
              | married people was 65/1 ± 10/93 and in unmarried ones it was 61/8 ± 11/31 . In this research
              | he found that there is a significant difference between male and females such that the mean and
              | the standard deviation from the male and female hardiness score was (11/15, 64/7), (10/86,
              | 62/2) respectively. The objective of this research is to investigate the relationship between
              | hardiness with work holism high school teachers in the academic year of 2012 - 2013. The main
              | assumption of the research is to examine the significant relationship between hardiness and the
              | rate of the work holism.
              | 2. METHODOLOGY
              | Research plan: The present study is a descriptive research which is includes 250 (145
              | male and 105 female) high school teachers of Ghorveh city working in the academic year of
              | 2010-2011. According to the Kukrun formulation 100 (50 male and 50 female) was selected as
              | the sample size using simple random method. Among male teachers 28 teachers or 56 % were
              | married and 22 ones or 44 % were unmarried and among females 30 % were unmarried and 70
              | % were married. We send them questionnaires as below:
              | The work holism measurement questionnaire: Work holism rate questionnaire had been
              | presented by Agha Beigi (2007) and includes 30 questions. It uses Likert scale to the test scoring
              | (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = always). It contains the most important constituents
              | of work holism. To measure the work holism questionnaire reliability in Agha Beigi research
              | 84 % was obtained via Kronbakh Alfa, also the test has been confirmed by masters and its
              | convergence simultaneously with A type of behavior questionnaire which has given 61 %
              | correlation coefficient that shows the test reliability.
              | Kobasa‘s (1988) third generation of hardiness questionnaire: It contains 50 questions
              | includes 17 questions about challenge, 16 questions about commitment and 17 questions about
              | control that have been formed based on the Likert scale (4 options) which had an amplitude
              | range from zero ( incorrect) to 3 ( correct). The scores of 39 acts of the test are scored reversely
              | and to each three subscales scores are presented separately and the non-weighted mean of these
              | three subscales are accounted for the total score of the hardiness. Kobasa’shardiness test has
              | been translated by Ghorbani (1995) and an acceptable content has been reported to it. Hardiness
              | constituents as control, commitment and challenge have a reliability coefficient of 7 %, 78 %
              | 72 % respectively and the reliability for total hardiness was 15 % ( Besharat, 2007).

              | As it is shown in Table 4 and given the obtained t scores there is a significant difference
              | among male and female teachers’ hardiness. That is the mean scores of hardiness among male
              | teachers are higher than females. Also the obtained scores show a difference between male and
              | female teacher’s work holism, it means that in work holism difference variable, the male mean
              | scores are higher than females.

              | 2.10
              | As it can be seen from Table 5 and regarding the obtained t scores, there is a significant
              | relationship among married and unmarried teachers in their hardiness; it means that the rate of
              | hardiness and work holism among married teachers is more than unmarried ones.
              | 3. DISCUSSION
              | Findings indicated that there is a negative and significant relationship between hardiness
              | and work holism and the higher the hardiness, the lower the work holism and vice versa.
              | These results showed that people with hardiness are very resistant to the mental stress and
              | they don’t hurt mentally under the influence of the stressful situations (Kobasa and Madi; 1982).
              | This research showed that hardiness has a negative correlation with drug and alcohol addiction
              | whether in the past or present. In addition, this research results are consistent with the results
              | from Brooks (2003) and Florian et al (1995) study about the positive relationship between
              | hardiness and physical or mental health. Shaparandand Kashani (1999); Rash et al (1995) and
              | Majidian (2004) about the negative relationship between hardiness and stress; King et al (1998)
              | believes that people with hardiness evaluate the unsatisfying situations in a challenging manner
              | not threateningly and they have more commitment about themselves and their work, also they
              | experience more sense of control in their lives.
              | The results confirmed the previous findings by researchers such as Spence and Robins
              | (1992), Asgari (2002), Jomhari (2002), Scott et al (1997) and Pitroswki – Vodanovich (2008).
              | Therefore to validate this relationship, it can be point to the mediating role of hardiness in
              | mental stress effects to create physical and mental disorders. Today, mental stress is served as
              | International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 5
meta          | 7
text          | a revealing indicator in mental disorders. It also has a significant role in some mental disorders
              | such as anxiety. Other researches show that people with high rate of hardiness encounter
              | stressful situations more effectively, for example by processing problems or converting
              | situations to the positive ones. Moreover, these people are less involve in physical erosion in
              | stressful conditions (Majidian, 2004). Of the other results was the hardiness difference among
              | males and females, so that the rate of hardiness in males was more than females, Which is
              | consistent with the findings of Ahadi et al (2008), Kobasa et al (1982).
              | With respect to the fact that women have more talent to depression (twice the men),
              | hardiness is a resistant shield against it (Sheppard, Kashani 1999). It can be pointed that men
              | are more involve in the internal elements in life events, while women are more involve in
              | external elements. In addition, there is a significant relationship between hardiness and marriage
              | status, as the rate of hardiness is higher in married people, which is consistent with the findings
              | of Ahadi et al (2008).
              | This is probably originated from the fact that married people have more responsibilities
              | comparing with unmarried ones. Most of them believe that they are not mainly belonging to
              | themselves, but their families also are involved in their decisions and behaviors. It seems that
              | they try to not serve the life events as boring and threatening and they usually try to make a
              | dynamic life based on the exalted goal for themselves and their families. One other result was
              | the difference between male and female as the rate of work holism in females was more than
              | males that is not consistent (Snir and Harpaz; 2006). To confirm this, some believe that men
              | are more involve in the internal elements, while women are more involve in the external
              | elements of life events.
              | The leading theory conclude that the work holists accept some effects that are always
              | enforcing, like admiration or criticism which cause to sustain behaviors relate to the work
              | holism (Mc Milan et al 2003). One of the research limitations was the lack of a similar research
              | in this area and relates to the topic in Iran and abroad; also this topic was new as there had been
              | found no similar research in scientific-searching databases, so there was not enough
              | background. One other limitation in the study was the use of usual samples (As they didn’t
              | consult to a consulting center and stated no complaint).
              | Also it was assumed that the work holist’s performances on a continuum have many
              | similarities in clinic and non-clinic populations. Anyway, the findings obtained from healthy
              | samples should be considered remarkably to use this tool in other researches with clinic samples
              | (they had consult to a center and stated a complaint). It is suggested that researchers examine
              | the relationship between hardiness and work holism in occupational, industrial and trading
              | groups. Also it can be useful to study a questionnaire with populations of various ages
              | (teenagers, middle-aged and old); some workshops can be made to teach hardiness and being
              | familiar with work holism to reduce work holism.
              | 4. CONCLUSION
              | The institutions can be instructed to give consulting services or enough information to
              | regulate work affairs to the extent that doesn’t eliminate some of the life important activities.
              | The results from this study have many applications in initial screening of the applicants in
              | consulting pre-stages, especially to treat social, family and personal problems in clinical and
              | researching environment.
