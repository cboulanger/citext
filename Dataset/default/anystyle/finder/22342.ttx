              | ABSTRACT. This article reports on a study of how Canadian
              | academics use on-line technologies to deal with increasing demands
              | and time pressures. The results suggest that, in struggling to manage
              | conflicting organizational and temporal priorities, academics are
              | adopting practices to manage these conflicts which adversely affect
              | the quality and content of their teaching and research. Moreover,
              | these changes in practice are integral to reconstituting the temporal
              | and organizational order of universities so they can function as nodes
              | in the wired global economy. Academics are urged to vigorously
              | champion temporal practices which allow time for reflection and
              | the ‘deep presence’ required for creative intellectual work. KEY

              | Introduction
              | The ‘ivory tower’ has been breached. The university is no longer a refuge from
              | the hustle-bustle, a slow zone for reading and reflection, critical dialogue and
              | knowledge creation – to the extent that it ever was. Some research we have
              | carried out not only confirms what others have documented about academics’
              | increasingly stressed state, as Canadian universities have been restructured and
              | have become nodes in the wired knowledge economy (Kinman and Jones,
              | 1998/2004). It also develops the proposition posed by Ylijoki and Mantyla

              | (2003) that the ‘conflicts in temporal perspectives’ (e.g. between ‘scheduled
              | time’ and ‘time-less’ creative time) ‘are closely linked’ to profound organiza-
              | tional shifts in universities. These shifts have been associated with concepts
              | such as ‘value for money’ (Cassin and Morgan, 1992), ‘managerialism’
              | (Newson, 1992), ‘the knowledge industry’ (Polster, 1998), ‘academic capital-
              | ism’ (Slaughter and Leslie, 1997), ‘the new public management,’ and the
              | transformation of relatively autonomous, self-governing academics into ‘man-
              | aged professionals’ and ‘state-subsidized entrepreneurs’ conforming to the
              | ‘fast-zone’ tempo of business and politics (Pels, 2003).
              | Our research not only sheds a light on these linkages and how the changed
              | temporal and structural order of the university campus is accompanied by
              | significant changes in academics’ practices. It shows the impact this is having on
              | the quality of teaching and research. The research also reveals how academics are
              | themselves participating in these changes, thus helping to co-produce, through
              | changed temporal and organizational practices, a new ‘social in motion’ (Thrift,
              | 2004) and a different ‘metaphysics of being’ (Adam, 2005). Yet, having identi-
              | fied their participation and agency, the research also explores the struggle many
              | academics seem to be engaged in over the conflicting temporal and organization-
              | al priorities within the wired university environment, and some of the personal
              | initiatives they are taking in response. We end with some thoughts on negotiating
              | personal, organizational and public policies to support, and even renew, the
              | academic vocation and the university as an institution of public culture.
              | The research involved a detailed survey of academics’ time and the quality of
              | their work life mapped against their use of new information technologies in a
              | context of significant shifts in universities’ funding arrangements. Follow-up
              | interviews probed some of the paradoxes and contradictions the survey results
              | uncovered – for example, that while most respondents felt better connected,
              | especially nationally and globally, many also felt more isolated; and while con-
              | sidering themselves more productive, many also felt that they were becoming
              | less creative. The research has completed its pilot-project phase, with around 80
              | questionnaires completed and 20 follow-up interviews done. The results are rich
              | and compelling enough that we want to give them broad exposure here.
              | The Social-organizational Context: Retrenching, Retro-fitting and
              | Repositioning1
              | Over the past two and a half decades, in response to successive shifts in govern-
              | ment funding policies, Canadian universities have significantly shifted from
              | being the public serving, collegially governed, nation-building institutions that
              | emerged during the post-Second World War period of expansion.2 They have
              | reinvented themselves as institutions more integrated with the global knowledge

text          | economy. This reinvention has not happened all at once. It has not only been
              | cumulative. Each layer of adaptation and each new initiative has rested upon and
              | interwoven with others, with mutually reinforcing effects.
              | The retrenchment layer began around the mid-1970s, as federal and provin-
              | cial levels of government gradually reduced their funding for education, health
              | and social programmes. At first, universities responded to funding shortfalls as
              | short-term fiscal crises which had to be handled until things returned to
              | ‘normal’. Over time, it became evident that ‘under-funding’ had become the
              | new reality.
              | As fiscal pressures increased, so too internal tensions were exacerbated. The
              | task of controlling and overseeing the budget became a determining feature of
              | university decision making. Correspondingly, the role and tasks of ‘manage-
              | ment’ began to occupy the institutional centre while the role of collegial govern-
              | ance through academic bodies such as faculty councils and senates became
              | increasingly marginalized.3
              | In the early 1980s, a powerful idea began to infuse higher education policy
              | that for universities to survive fiscal retrenchment, they needed to reposition
              | themselves to secure new sources of funding. Organizations such as the newly
              | founded Corporate-Higher Education Forum, the Canadian Manufacturers
              | Association and the (now defunct) Science Council of Canada argued that
              | mutually beneficial partnerships between universities and private sector corpo-
              | rations would rescue universities from their funding woes while enabling
              | Canadian corporations greater access to cutting-edge science to advance their
              | competitive position in the globalizing economy. In response, Canadian univer-
              | sities began to orient their programmatic objectives toward the economic and
              | political priorities of external agents who could provide additional, albeit
              | marginal, sources of funding.
              | Over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s, a range of changes in universi-
              | ties’ institutional practices ‘retro-fitted’ them for their new and expanding role
              | in promoting economic innovation and competitiveness. On the one hand, the
              | expanding managerially oriented apparatus of decision making and university–
              | corporate linking arrangements reinforced each other and wove together. As
              | government funding became less reliable, universities needed to exist within
              | new and constantly fluctuating budgetary configurations. For this, universities
              | developed an extensive tool-kit of performance-based measures and systems
              | for monitoring and supervising the activities of academics individually and
              | collectively. Cost-efficiency, productivity and accountability to real or putative
              | external paymasters in terms of quantifiable, business-like ‘deliverables’
              | became the predominant criteria for assessing and making decisions about
              | ‘worthwhile’ expenditures of money, time and energy. On the other hand,
              | universities needed to develop tools for attracting and managing contractual
              | partnerships with corporate clients. For this, mission statements, strategic plans,
meta          | 86

              | and advertising campaigns became the institutional instruments for shaping and
              | representing their research and teaching priorities as attuned to the needs and
              | objectives of these potential funders. By the mid-1990s, universities had made
              | the necessary cultural shifts and developed the institutional capacity to function
              | as more permeable, multi-purpose, and networked knowledge businesses.4
              | Since 1996, the federal government has infused a massive jolt of research fund-
              | ing through the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the Canada Research
              | Chairs programmes – $4.5 billion – into these newly emerging ‘knowledge
              | businesses’ in ways that push them further down a market-focused path.5 Three-
              | quarters of this funding must secure 60 per cent matched funding from research
              | partners who, more often than not, are private sector corporations. Added to this,
              | in 2002 the presidents of Canada’s universities signed an agreement with govern-
              | ment committing their universities and researchers to doubling their research
              | productivity and tripling their commercialization performance by 2010.
              | Finally, the substantial restructuring that has occurred in Canadian universi-
              | ties since the 1980s has been significantly enabled by information and commu-
              | nications technologies (ICTs). These have been a key element in ‘retro-fitting’
              | universities to function as externally guided, strategically minded, production-
              | driven knowledge businesses. As our research confirms, these technologies
              | range from specific tools, such as instructional software, listservs and chat-
              | discussion groups for students, to an Internet-connected networked environment
              | allowing global collaboration among academics and new non-academic part-
              | ners, web-based teaching and administration and comprehensive data collection
              | to serve both on-campus and off-campus reporting requirements. It is not sur-
              | prising that the increasingly networked, boundary-crossing university would so
              | rapidly embrace these technologies as essential ‘tools of the trade’ for doing
              | academic work. It also makes sense that, in keeping with prevailing policy
              | rhetoric, many advocates of technology-mediated teaching, global connectivity
              | and ‘the wired campus’ have promoted the turn to technology, not only as the
              | ‘cutting edge’ of higher education in a fast-paced globalizing world but also
              | as an efficient way of responding to the many opportunities and demands that
              | confront universities and their faculty.
              | The Findings
              | Our research not only confirmed academics’ widespread use of the ICTs in
              | everything from research, preparing and teaching classes, to administration
              | (largely self-serve now since the cutbacks in support staff) and communicating
              | with students, friends and colleagues locally and internationally.6 Academics
              | seem to have adapted to the medium to the point that it is fast becoming a com-
              | fort zone, though fraught with anxiety and contradictions.

text          | Clearly, they like many things about the new university environment. It’s
              | increasing the exposure of their work, especially to national and international
              | colleagues (nearly 60% reported this, the women more so than men). It’s
              | increased their collaborative projects not just a little but a lot.7 They also feel that
              | it’s made them more productive (55% of women and 42% of men reported this).
              | And it’s increased their connections with students, colleagues and friends, seem-
              | ingly without jeopardizing their sense of being in touch with them; although
              | there’s ambivalence here and even a hint of contradiction. It’s also increased
              | their sense of being part of university decision making, though just as many indi-
              | cated that this had decreased. On the other hand, 51 per cent said that it had not
              | allowed them to have more control over their work schedule. Sixty per cent
              | (71% of the women, 50% of men) feel that it’s increased expectations of what
              | they can accomplish. Nearly 40 per cent (45% of the women, 31% of men)
              | reported feeling overwhelmed by the plethora of opportunities to which the new
              | environment exposed them. And 43 per cent (40% of women, 47% of men)
              | reported that it uses up their time solving technological problems.
              | It is clear, then, that there are many things academics do not like about the
              | new environment. In the most decisive response in the questionnaire, 69 per cent
              | said that they do not thrive on the time pressures and fast pace of it (56% of
              | women indicated this, compared to 81% of the men). Not surprisingly, the
              | respondents reported many of the most common symptoms of stress, from sleep
              | deprivation (53% of women, compared to 42% of men) to new allergies or food
              | sensitivities (26% of women, compared to 6% of men), short-term memory loss
              | (45% of women compared to 25% of men) and problems concentrating (37% of
              | women compared to 19% of men). Interestingly, while the women also reported
              | more stress in personal relationships, from strained relations with family (26%
              | compared to 11% of men) to strained relations with colleagues (34% of women
              | compared to 19% of men), the men reported far more incidents of road rage and
              | its variants (22% of men, versus 5% of women).
              | Stress is an important personal and public-health issue in itself, and deserves
              | urgent attention. However, echoing others’ speculations, we see it here as a
              | symptom of some fundamental contradictions involved in the pursuit of effi-
              | ciency through time compression (Sabelis, 2002). In particular, we explore this
              | through two related themes: first, academics’ ability to be present with them-
              | selves and others and, second, their ability to be socially and intellectually
              | engaged in a way that will yield original knowledge, rather than a higher publi-
              | cation rate.
              | Presence and engagement
              | A number of contradictory findings led us to focus on this aspect of academics’
              | existence. For example, despite reporting enhanced connectivity and collabora-
meta          | 88

              | tion with others, 34 per cent of our respondents reported feeling isolated (40%
              | of women compared to 22% of men). We specifically asked whether they ‘are
              | able to stay centred in yourself, to know what matters to you’ in a wired
              | environment where they are increasingly accountable to multiple outside and
              | corporate-linked actors and subject to their demands and pressures. The results
              | were equivocal. Thirty-four per cent said that this ability had decreased, 29 per
              | cent felt it had increased and 37 per cent said it hadn’t changed. On the other
              | hand, a startling 65 per cent reported that their ability to follow through on infor-
              | mal, personal/professional commitments (possibly off line and off campus in the
              | community) had decreased. As well, 57 per cent said that they felt like they were
              | ‘reacting, not acting on my own initiative’ on occasion, and another 19 per cent
              | said they felt this way frequently. Forty-five per cent reported feeling anxious
              | about keeping up with work demands and expectations frequently, and another
              | 12 per cent reported feeling this way chronically. In a similar vein, 47 per cent
              | feel as though they’re fighting to keep control on occasion and another 20 per
              | cent feel that way frequently. Moreover, 58 per cent reported that their ability
              | to stay focused on their work had decreased, and 42 per cent reported that their
              | susceptibility to being distracted by all the information and communication
              | coming at them had increased.
              | These findings suggest a significant degree of ‘temporal alienation,’ which
              | Ronald Purser (2002) defines as a ‘loss of situated presence in time’ (p. 163),
              | and which we interpret here to mean presence with others and to one’s self.
              | A professor of organizational behaviour at one university reported having
              | ‘fewer and fewer coffees with colleagues who are right in the building and . . .
              | [now] more short conversations with people I would never have contacted
              | before. So I’m trading one for the other.’ ‘Quantity for quality?’ she was asked.
              | ‘Yes’, she said. ‘It is very superficial and there is no real depth of communica-
              | tion, but if it weren’t for that there would be none.’ She went on to say that
              | she’s losing her political consciousness because ‘there’s no one to push me and
              | develop me . . . and say, that’s good as far as it goes, and have you thought about
              | . . .?’ As a result, she said, ‘I have less confidence in my own analysis . . . It’s
              | almost back to those pre-consciousness days. We are living in that isolation and
              | not having any validation.’
              | A professor of English at another university misses the long, late-night phone
              | calls she used to have with close colleagues and friends now that everyone has
              | answering machines and communicates through email: ‘there’s the absence of
              | voice and all of the lateral thinking that goes on when you actually have a real
              | conversation, instead of just a focused interchange . . . the actual isolation from
              | people in a local community has increased enormously’.
              | A professor of occupational therapy at yet another university echoed this
              | theme: ‘I feel very connected to people I don’t expect to see. But what I do find
              | is that people I expect to see, like my colleagues who are in the same building, I
              | MENZIES & NEWSON: NO TIME TO THINK
meta          | 89
text          | may not see.’ When she does see them is at meetings. But then, ‘I find I’m often,
              | now, lately quiet in meetings, when I’m not by nature quiet. And I think part of
              | it is because I’m now with people who I only see at meetings! And so, it’s like
              | meeting quasi-strangers . . .’
              | A professor of social work at the same university worried that as she and
              | others become habituated to email communication, a more superficial level of
              | social engagement can become the cultural norm: ‘It is a stilted dialogue.’ She
              | was asked, ‘does it move you away from spontaneity?’. ‘Yes, and that’s not all.
              | Sometimes we think with our mouths. But on the other hand, we’re so pressured
              | to give a response that we type up something and send it out because of the
              | pressure for a response, so that doesn’t improve it.’
              | Elsewhere, a professor of film studies lamented that this pressure serves as
              | an alibi for non-presence: ‘It is easier if everyone is anonymous. It makes it
              | easier to refuse social interaction. It makes it easier to turn people into things
              | and to just not be creating a humanistic environment.’ This has particularly
              | acute implications for women, she thinks. ‘We women have always been
              | the embodied subject and technology seems to be erasing our presence in the
              | world . . . That’s how we exist – as an embodied subject. And I feel technology
              | is just damaging our sense of authenticity that way – authentic subjects who
              | interact.’
              | A professor of engineering at yet another university likes how the ‘log-on
              | classroom’ allows shy students to at least start opening up. However, he also
              | quickly invites students to his office once they’ve broached something substan-
              | tial: ‘With email, you can’t read the person’s mode of thinking. So I say, let’s
              | have an appointment.’ Face to face, he continued, ‘I can see if they are com-

              | ing out the time and pace that the mental and social habits of reflection and
              | critical dialogue require.
              | Knowledge creation, or production?
              | Academics’ ability to stay focused and their susceptibility to being distracted,
              | discussed earlier, clearly affect the ability to think critically and create original
              | knowledge. The survey also included questions probing intellectual engage-
              | ment. For example, an overwhelming majority (65% of both men and women)
              | reported that they are not reading as deeply and reflectively as they used to or as
              | they want to. Nor are they reading as broadly and inter-disciplinarily as they
              | used to or as they’d like to. Instead, they are scanning, mining sources for selec-
              | tive bits of information. (‘I am reading for specific information . . .’). In response
              | to suggestive statements such as ‘I don’t have enough free chunks of time in
              | which to think’, 51 per cent indicated that they did not, reinforcing one of the
              | significant findings of an Icelandic study of academics, which documented a
              | loss of what they called ‘timeless time’ for research and reflection (Ylijoke and
              | Mantyla, 2003). As well, a significant minority (28%) identified with the phrase,
              | ‘I can’t slow down enough to be in touch with myself and my innermost
              | thoughts’ and, in the same proportion, the statement ‘Everybody I know is too
              | busy to just talk’. As a kind of summing up, they were asked to consider Marcel
              | Proust’s lament for a quality of being in time that allowed for deep memory
              | association. Forty-one per cent said that their capacity for this level of origi-
              | nal/creative thinking had decreased, and fifteen per cent, that it had increased.
              | Overall, we think that the findings on this theme reinforce Ida Sabelis’s
              | (2002) concerns about time compression: not just what gets left out, including
              | the time for reflection and dialogue, but also how difficult it is to decompress,
              | thus decreasing what she considers to be the most important aspect of commu-
              | nication: ‘the expression and exchange of meaning’ (p. 93). The interview com-
              | ments flesh out these concerns, and their implications for the future of learning
              | and knowledge creation.
              | A professor of English described sitting at her computer with several win-
              | dows open at once and simultaneously having new emails signalling on her
              | screen: ‘So you have all these things going on, and in my mind it is almost the
              | perfect match for attention deficit disorder . . . By the time you are a couple of
              | hours into your email you have lost it. You’re skimming, fragmenting . . .Your
              | life is so fragmented. All these emails are coming – “get back to me before my
              | meeting”.’
              | The professor of occupational therapy quoted earlier described having been
              | involved in an international book project that was three years behind schedule:
              | ‘We tried to do a lot of it by email, and sending our chapters to each other and
              | talking about it, but we didn’t put real fire into this book until I went over to

text          | Australia for six weeks. So it’s a really interesting illustration, because email
              | made it possible for us to work together, but somehow it didn’t help us to get the
              | work done.’
              | A professor of mathematics and statistics at yet another university com-
              | mented on how the fast-paced productivity push toward getting the next grant;
              | publishing the next paper drives out the time for creating a social space-time of
              | shared learning and knowing:
              | We are becoming loners . . . We are creating in our offices . . . because we have
              | more access to information and we have tools to do things faster, but we are not
              | sharing with other people to become more sociable. That is the contradiction . . .
              | For example, it used to be they had a weekly seminar and every professor would
              | come and show what they were doing. Everyone commented. This has stopped.
              | There are no weekly seminars anymore because people have said that they don’t
              | have time . . . [But now, she finds] The big questions aren’t being asked anymore.
              | I feel that we are giving students the wrong idea about what learning is. I think
              | the students are now coming to believe it’s just reading a lot, being familiar with a
              | lot of information, trying to get information somehow. We are not teaching them
              | to use that information, to process it and then to create something. I think that in
              | this sense, that is what they call passivity. If they are passive, they don’t create.
              | A biology professor at another university echoed this concern, worrying at how
              | much both how teachers teach and how students do their work has devolved into
              | ‘modules’ that students alternately ingest or cut and paste into assignments. ‘But
              | learning isn’t about the details of what you are learning, I think. It is more
              | fundamental . . . The important point ultimately is just to get the students to
              | think. It doesn’t matter, it could be biology. Thinking about how biology works
              | as opposed to knowing little bits about biology.’
              | The professor of engineering quoted earlier talked about how important face-
              | to-face dialogue is to convey to students that one is always creating knowledge
              | afresh, not just replicating it prescriptively. For example, he said, ‘how to deal
              | with a design problem on line. In many ways it is trial and error. Even defining
              | the problem, it isn’t really an absolute. We say the structure could be very rigid
              | or very flexible. We can solve the problem this way, or this way. You know what
              | I mean? . . . The problem is open-ended. If it is closed, innovation is meaning-
              | less.’
              | Interpreting the findings through the lens of temporality
              | Clearly, the changes affecting universities through the combined effects of
              | retrenching, repositioning plus retro-fitting have included a radical change in
              | temporality. From the evidence of the survey and the follow-up interviews, this
              | change, while linked to the organizational structures and related routines of
              | universities, has resonated through the routines and rhythms of academics’ daily

              | life. To grasp its importance, particularly with a view to developing an agenda
              | for research and policy action, it’s useful to identify some of the particular ways
              | in which this cultural transformation is manifest, for instance through temporal
              | frameworks, through temporal-social practices and through the shaping power
              | of temporal rhythms.
              | Dick Pels (2003) provides a useful overview of the shifting temporal coordi-
              | nates on which universities now run. In what he calls the ‘social triangle’ of
              | discourse in the public sphere, he locates the university in the ‘culture/science’
              | node (p. 21). He argues that its reputedly tempered pace traditionally had a
              | mitigating influence on the otherwise faster time frames and pace associated
              | with business and the market economy, occupying the second apex of his
              | triangle, and on politics/the state, occupying the third. Now, however, the macro
              | influences of globalization and the ‘fast’ subject positions of the new economy
              | (Thrift, 2000b: 674) combined with ‘the imperatives of academic entrepreneur-
              | ship and self-generated funding’ – features of a repositioned and retro-fitted
              | academia – are breaking universities out of their own largely autonomous
              | temporal framework, and integrating them with the faster and more present-
              | minded ones associated with business and politics. As our research documented,
              | this is clearly happening, with ICT networks and their users playing a decisively
              | enabling role. Moreover, academics are adapting to the shorter time lines and
              | new ‘infrastructural routines’ associated with the wired campus, often willingly
              | and for their own self-interest.
              | Our research also sheds light on the changing temporal practices associated
              | with the networked, on-line campus. Not only is time compressed. It is frag-
              | mented and then recombined as many-layered moments through multi-tasking.
              | As discussed, this has consequences, ranging from the suppression of time-
              | consuming activities like reflection and memory (Sabelis, 2002) to temporal
              | alienation. While Purser (2002) links this explicitly to a shifting temporality,
              | arguing that the loss of presence happens as people ‘embody’ and ‘obey’ the
              | mechanical or digital rhythms of clock time, Nigel Thrift (2004) perceptively
              | adds a layer of useful complexity by discussing how temporal practices are
              | diffused more broadly through organizational innovations like productivity
              | measures and the application of logistical reasoning to expediting the flow of
              | goods and information.
              | Instrumental rationality, of which logistical reasoning is a variation, essen-
              | tially ‘takes the world largely as given and attempts to find means of living ever
              | more productively and efficiently in it’ (Hassan, 2003: 229). It’s thinking
              | focused on the how of things rather than the why. It trades in data (givens) over
              | the more experience-based stuff of interpretation. While historical critiques of
              | instrumentalism, associated with the Frankfurt School for example, didn’t
              | speculate about the role of time (Hassan, 2003), we would argue that it runs on
              | clock time: not only an externally determined and regulated time, and a time of

meta          | 93
text          | isolated moments, of instrumental observation, of data analysis and so on, but a
              | time that can be optimized by standardized processes and speed-up, driven by
              | others. Its service to business and industry has been one of the hallmarks of
              | capitalism, epitomized in the phrase ‘time is money’. As it was then, in the days
              | of factory-like rational bureaucracies, so it likely will be now as global digital
              | networks embody instrumental reason in their systems and software, and extend
              | the efficiencies of particular managerially oriented innovations throughout
              | public life. ‘Results’ and ‘expected outcomes’ are achieved more quickly.
              | Performance and delivery are made faster, no matter what the ‘deliverables’
              | might be, be they student job placements or time-sensitive research reports.
              | Our research yielded shifts in thinking, from interpretation toward instru-
              | mental productivity. Our academic respondents have shifted a lot of their focus
              | to self-serve administration, fund raising, report writing and technology problem
              | solving, and their social interactions have shifted from spontaneous conversa-
              | tions with local well-known colleagues to brief, focused, task-specific exchanges
              | with many near-strangers.
              | If instrumental reasoning is the grammar of a new temporal systems order, the
              | bits and bytes of digital communication are its language. The relevant point here
              | is that it is a language of standardized abstractions delinked from the particulars
              | of place and people, their embodied experience, stories and memories. And
              | while it still takes time for people to key this language onto the screen, or click
              | and drag it from one file to another, the abstract immateriality of the medium
              | means that its scope for embodied presence is minimal and its capacity to invoke
              | the rhythms of dialogue, nil. Partly, this is due to another temporal aspect of the
              | wired university environment, namely that communication is instant.
              | This is the novelty of ‘real time’, making digital networks hyper-efficient
              | from an instrumental point of view but potentially dangerous from a human and
              | cultural point of view. As Ronald Purser (2002) argues, in its deft collapse of
              | action and reaction through simultaneity, the real time on which digital networks
              | operate models a reality characterized by Hannah Arendt as the ‘means-ends
              | paradigm’ (p. 156). This view of what’s real is focused entirely on bringing
              | about the desired result. Purser argues that time of any duration longer than an
              | instant is immaterial, an obstacle to be removed. Yet the effect of this – what one
              | interview subject referred to simply as ‘the pressure to respond’ – is for people
              | to ‘fall back on learned routines and unconscious cognitive biases’, in short to
              | ‘perform’. In Thrift’s (2000b) characterization of life in the globalized new
              | economy, where everything is a ‘blur of change’, a permanent state of ‘emer-
              | gency bordering on chaos’ and every advantage ‘temporary’, the watchword is
              | ‘performability’. This means, as the word suggests, performance to script and
              | specifications, delivering on prescribed deliverables and maximizing whatever
              | advantage is available now, now, now. For academics, this implies getting
              | grants, producing knowledge, and accumulating publications, patents and other
meta          | 94

              | results – not necessarily authentic original knowledge, oriented to the public
              | good.
              | Moreover, this performabilty dynamic can be habit forming, and can funda-
              | mentally shape the consciousness, or habitus,8 of all participants, including aca-
              | demics. For example, nearly 30 per cent of our respondents affirmed, ‘I can’t
              | slow down enough to be in touch with my innermost thoughts’, displaying
              | Sabelis’s concerns about the inability of chronically time-compressed people to
              | decompress and, as Pels (2003) recommends, to generally ‘decelerate’ or
              | ‘unhasten’. Academics, like others ‘repositioned’ as actors in a globally net-
              | worked world, can ‘become entrained to the rhythms of the dominant economic
              | order’ (Purser, 2002: 157) and its quick-click, real-time beat.
              | It’s true to the point of being a truism that we are all rooted in the ‘rhythmic-
              | ity of the cosmos, the seasons and the times of the body’ (Sabelis, 2002: 11).
              | Nonetheless, rhythms based on social convention have so eclipsed natural
              | rhythms, particularly in the ‘socially integrative role’ which rhythms play, that
              | many primal rhythms are residual to the point of being vestigial. Moreover, as
              | the staccato, now-this, now-this beat of real time augments the metronomic,
              | externally regulated beat of regulated and scheduled time and permeates the
              | social environment, there is a danger that the sense of rootedness in anything
              | embodied and physical will become that much weaker. Accordingly, the social
              | habits, the temporal practices and social rhythms associated with embodied
              | reflection, memory and dialogue may wither as well.
              | The academics we interviewed are wise, therefore, to ask what kind of tem-
              | poral and cultural practices they’re modelling to their students as they practise
              | the processing of information rather than its interpretation through dialogue, and
              | performance-to-specifications ways of thinking rather than open-ended innova-
              | tion. As Helga Nowotny (1994) notes, ‘new knowledge arises under changed
              | conditions of creation and in changed structures of organization’ (p. 87).
              | The English professor quoted earlier commented on the cost-efficient shift
              | from face-to-face seminar discussions to electronic chat groups at her centre-of-
              | excellence university:
              | I worry about the computer and the screen and the absence of embodiment, [and]
              | that the people who are going to make it through the system and arrive at decision-
              | making places are people who have an absolute disdain for the human condition –
              | for the human body! Does one want people in policy making, making decisions
              | about one’s health . . . who are so immune to, or who need so little inter-human
              | action?
              | A professor of biology makes a point of keeping his office and lab doors open,
              | and frequenting the public spaces across the campus: ‘I think the students need
              | to see you as a real person, someone who is in a lab or coffee room or in the halls
              | . . . Students need to realize that academia is a part of society. It is part of what
              | our lives are about,’ he said. In short, it seems that he’s modelling what Barbara
              | MENZIES & NEWSON: NO TIME TO THINK
meta          | 95
text          | Adam (1995) calls being ‘an implicated participant’ in the world (p. 141). In
              | turn, by getting students talking, and having some continuity with them from
              | one course to another, he says, they get ‘a sense that they matter . . . By [my]
              | being interested in what they have to say, being interested in their ideas, they ask
              | questions, even if they are afraid they are what they call “stupid questions”.’
              | The professor of engineering at the same university quoted earlier also takes
              | time to meet and talk with students. He does this to model being open-ended in
              | one’s thinking as an engineer. ‘Doubt,’ he said, ‘you can’t make that electronic.’
              | A professor of film studies at the University of Regina talked about the impor-
              | tance of modelling speaking with one’s own particular voice as a way of encour-
              | aging students to find their own. ‘The way the new generation goes about doing
              | research, with absolutely no depth,’ she said. ‘The kind of things they will
              | search out on the internet – switching from this to that. But there’s just no depth
              | to their sense of what you do with all this material. How do you focus?’ And
              | so she tells students to come see her, where she helps them find that focus by
              | getting them talking and, by listening to them stumbling to express themselves,
              | helping them realize that ‘what you have to say is important’.
              | Conclusion: Implications for Research and Policy
              | Perhaps the biggest lesson to be drawn from our analysis of the changed tempo-
              | rality of academics and their work is the importance of time to understanding/
              | analysing organizational and social change. Not only is the body a ‘bio-political
              | terrain’ (Thrift 2000a: 46), but so also are organizations like universities, and the
              | social environment in general, including the one in which research and policy
              | debates take place. They are landscapes and timescapes rooted in bodies that
              | remember and experience life through all their senses.
              | A second lesson is that the medium is the message. If the goal of the univer-
              | sity in a democratic society is to affirm the importance of critical thinking, dia-
              | logue and original knowledge creation in academics and their students, then
              | the debate about the changes in universities and academic work which we
              | have described, and decision making on appropriate policy responses, must be
              | broadly, democratically participatory, with all that this implies in temporal
              | terms. As the interview comments suggest, academics who had chosen or gone
              | along with on-line communication for practically everything are now choosing
              | to set limits and, in returning to sustained face-to-face communication in, for
              | example, brainstorming with students, are rediscovering the benefits of that
              | attuned in-depth engagement. We might anticipate, therefore, that in an inclu-
              | sive debate about the changing university environment, as academics and
              | administrators take the time for face-to-face dialogue, they might more vigor-
              | ously champion measures to uphold these temporal practices in organizational

              | policy. Equally, as academics, personally and collectively, take the necessary
              | steps to restore presence deep enough for reflective dialogue, they might dis-
              | cover a refreshed originality in their own work, which would inspire more
              | people to read and talk about it.
              | Notes
              | 1. An expanded discussion of this material can be found in Newson (2005, 1998).
              | 2. In the 1950s and 1960s, federal and provincial governments in Canada committed
              | increasing levels of funding to expanding existing and new universities to serve two
              | primary objectives: developing a highly skilled labour force to aid Canada’s economic
              | development and educating citizens to fulfil their democratic role in society.
              | 3. George Keller’s book, Academic Strategy (1984), was an influential intervention
              | during this period, advocating a shift in universities from ‘administration’ to ‘man-
              | agement’. Keller described the advantages of ‘management’ as being more assertive,
              | fast acting, strategically oriented and externally focused than traditional university
              | administration which took direction from the internal considerations and priorities of
              | collegial bodies.
              | 4. Claire Polster (University of Regina) coined this term.
              | 5. Claire Polster (2002) has written the definitive analysis of the CFI and CRC pro-
              | grammes and their implications for Canadian higher education.
              | 6. And again, using individual tools such as email and listservs, web-based searches and
              | course postings, but habitual use of the Internet-connected wired university environ-
              | ment for daily administrative routines to collaborative research and other projects with
              | academic and non-academic partners around the country and around the world.
              | 7. Here as elsewhere, there was a significant gender difference, with 37 per cent of
              | women reporting ‘a lot’ compared to 22 per cent of the men. Generally, women’s
              | responses showed some of the most dramatic extremes, both embracing new benefits
              | through ICTs and sensing the contradictions more acutely. See Menzies and Newson
              | (2005) for a more extensive gender analysis.
              | 8. Drawing on both Bourdieu’s original coining of the concept and Christopher
              | Gosden’s (1979) modification of it, we consider habitus to be a fluid habitat for
              | the mind and consciousness, a sort of ‘sedimentation of past practice in the human
              | organism so that it unconsciously guides future practice’ (Gosden, 1979: 117).
