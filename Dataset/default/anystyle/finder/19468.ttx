              | Market Integration and Market Structure in the European Soft Drinks Industry:
              | Always Coca-Cola?
              | by Catherine Matraves*
              | This paper focuses on the question of European integration, considering whether the
              | geographic level at which competition takes place differs across the two major segments
              | of the soft drinks industry: carbonated soft drinks and mineral water. Our evidence
              | shows firms are competing at the European level in both segments. Interestingly, the
              | European market is being integrated through corporate strategy, defined as increased
              | multinationality, rather than increased trade flows. To interpret these results, this paper
              | uses the new theory of market structure where the essential notion is that in endogenous
              | sunk cost industries such as soft drinks, the traditional inverse structure-size relation
              | may break down, due to the escalation of overhead expenditures.

              | Marktintegration und Marktstruktur in der europäischen Getränkeindustrie:
              | Immer Coca-Cola?
              | In diesem Beitrag wird der Frage nachgegangen, wie sich die europäische Integration
              | auf den Wettbewerb auswirkt. Am Beispiel der beiden Hauptsegmente
              | nichtalkoholischer Getränke - kohlensäurehaltige Softdrinks und Mineralwasser -
              | wird untersucht, ob sie sich im Hinblick auf die geographische Ebene, auf der
              | Wettbewerb stattfindet, unterscheiden. Die empirischen Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin,
              | daß die Unternehmen in Europa in beiden Segmenten im Wettbewerb stehen.
              | Interessanterweise wird der europäische Markt eher durch Unternehmensstrategien
              | integriert, die in wachsendem Maße multinational ausgerichtet sind, als durch
              | zunehmende Handelsströme. Bei der Interpretation der Ergebnisse stützt sich die
              | Autorin auf die neue Theorie der Marktstruktur, derzufolge in Industrien mit endogenen
              | versunkenen Kosten - und hierzu zählt auch die Getränkeindustrie - die traditionell
              | inverse Beziehung zwischen Marktstruktur und Marktvolumen angesichts der hohen
              | Overhead-Ausgaben aufgehoben wird.

              | 1. Introduction
              | This paper applies the new theory of industrial structure (Sutton, 1991, 1998) to the European
              | soft drinks industry. Sutton’s major advance was to generate robust and testable predictions from
              | the theory of strategic behavior, where robustness means broad regularities that hold across a
              | range of benchmark oligopoly models. Unlike the ‘New Empirical IO’ literature in structural
              | modeling (see Bresnahan, 1989, and Geroski, 1988, for surveys), this then allows a wide set of
              | industries to be analyzed. The basic theoretical notion is that in homogeneous ‘Type 1’ industries,
              | characterized by exogenous sunk costs, the traditional inverse structure-size relation holds.
              | However, in ‘Type 2’ industries, characterized by endogenous sunk costs, as market size becomes
              | very large, firms may escalate their advertising and/or R&D expenditure in response, and the
              | inverse structure-size relation may break down. Sutton’s own empirical work confirms his
              | predictions, combining cross-section regression analysis with industry cases.1 The detailed
              | industry histories form the backbone of Sutton (1991); such analysis reveals rather more
              | qualitative evidence of the differing mechanisms made explicit in the theoretical framework.
              | Although Sutton investigated the soft drinks industry as an example of how the ‘escalation
              | mechanism’ operates in an endogenous sunk cost industry, this paper extends his analysis in two
              | interesting directions. First, we focus on the question of market integration. Over the period that
              | Sutton considered, he was able to assume that the soft drinks industry was mainly local, with
              | some multinational production. Essentially, it was assumed that a separate advertising outlay was
              | necessary to establish a brand image in each member state. This implies that competition within
              | Europe was taking place at the national rather than at the EU level. However, in 1987, the Single
meta          | 2
text          | European Act was legislated. If the EU market becomes the relevant competitive market, this is
              | equivalent to an increase in market size as firms will have access to a larger geographic area. As
              | market size increases, this yields the prediction that the incentive for firms to endogenously
              | escalate advertising expenditure is increased. The integration process may also be expected to
              | have some impact on the issue of where to locate production, or indeed, how to organize
              | distribution. Thus, our first extension is to consider the appropriate geographic level at which
              | competition takes place, and interestingly, whether this differs across the two major segments of
              | the soft drinks industry: carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) and mineral water.
              | Secondly, Sutton (1991) argues that a first mover may spend more on advertising than would be
              | the case under strategic symmetry, but may thereby succeed in relegating an equally efficient late
              | entrant to second place. In other words, it may be unprofitable for such a later entrant to attempt
              | to equal the leader at the high-quality end of the market, and so its advertising efforts might be
              | correspondingly muted. The soft drinks industry may be an example of this phenomenon where in
              | the US, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are dominant firms and have more or less an equal market share
              | in the dominant cola segment; competition in advertising has had a large impact on market
              | structure. In the EU, by contrast, Sutton argued that Coca-Cola has a first mover advantage
              | dating from World War II. This first mover advantage has muted advertising competition, and
              | resulted in persistent market dominance. He showed that first, concentration is much lower in the
              | EU member states due to the large fringe of small producers, with lower advertising to sales
              | ratios. Secondly, Coca-Cola’s market share relative to Pepsi is much higher within the cola
              | segment. However, it is important to highlight that market size was also much smaller than in the
              | 1 Robinson and Chiang (1996), Lyons and Matraves (1996), Lyons, Matraves and Moffatt (1999) provide further

text          | US which, in turn, may have reduced the incentive for potential rivals to endogenously escalate
              | their advertising expenditure. If market size has increased, the soft drinks industry structure in the
              | EU may come to mirror the US more. Sutton was unable to separate the relative influences of
              | first mover advantage and market size. We provide such an attempt.
              | We analyze both segments of the soft drinks industry, using more recent data at the 3-digit level
              | of aggregation. Section two provides a brief summary of the underlying theoretical framework,
              | based on Sutton (1991). In section three, we first discuss the structural changes that have taken
              | place between 1987 and 1993. Second, we generate empirical predictions, feeding the exogenous
              | structural changes into the theoretical framework. Section four assesses whether the evidence on
              | concentration and advertising intensity is consistent with the derived hypotheses. It then moves on
              | to focus on the competitive strategies followed by the firms themselves, within the context of the
              | theoretical framework. Finally, section five summarizes and concludes.
              | 2. Theoretical Framework: The Sutton Approach
              | The competitive roles that exogenous and endogenous sunk costs play in the determination of
              | market structure are now well known: Robinson and Chiang (1996), Lyons and Matraves (1996),
              | Matraves (1999) provide summaries of the Sutton (1991) approach. Suffice to say that following
              | Schmalensee (1992), we may split industries into two types: Type 1 and Type 2.2 In Type 1
              | industries (homogeneous/horizontally differentiated products), the traditional inverse structure-
              | size relation holds. In Type 2 industries, this relationship may break down due to the notion that
              | 2 Sutton (Chapters 2 and 3, 1991) provide the formal theoretical exposition for both Type 1 and Type 2 industries.
meta          | 4
text          | expenditure on advertising/R&D in order to increase (perceived) quality is a choice variable. It is
              | this choice that emphasizes the fundamental difference because firms can react to increases in
              | market size by investing in quality enhancements. The consequent rise in overheads has a
              | countervailing effect on market structure by increasing the degree of economies of scale. Thus,
              | although there appears more room in a larger market, the escalation process raises fixed costs per
              | firm, possibly even to such an extent that the negative structure-size relation breaks down.
              | Certainly, the resulting market structure will be less fragmented than in a Type 1 industry.3
              | Consider the question of market integration within this framework. Since market concentration
              | results from the interaction between market size and a few key behavioral and technological
              | factors, it is extremely important that the correct market definition is used in empirical work.4 We
              | provide an attempt to correctly identify the geographic level at which competition takes place.
              | The criterion that is typically used to measure the degree of integration is the degree of
              | international trade: in this case, intra-EU trade. However, although trade is a reasonable indicator
              | of integration in production, it is unlikely to capture the relevant market for technology and
              | marketing ideas, particularly if firms are multinational. Endogenous sunk costs therefore introduce
              | the possibility of intra-firm economies of scope in their international operations.
              | The soft drinks industry is an advertising intensive industry. Unlike the results from R&D which
              | can be easily exploited across borders, even if production decisions do remain non-integrated,
              | advertising is highly dependent on local language, culture and media. This implies that advertising
              | is more likely to be incurred in each country, as long as the national market is large enough for
              | 3 High production economies of scale work in favor of a more negative relation; while greater consumer sensitivity
              | to endogenous investments weigh in favor of a shallow (or even positive) relation.

text          | such spending to be worthwhile. If the relevant production market becomes the EU, but
              | advertising costs are incurred in each member state, this twists the balance of the fixed cost
              | mechanisms towards the importance of endogenous fixed costs. However, if advertising decisions
              | are taken at the EU level or, as is perhaps more likely, if marketing expertise is transferable across
              | national borders, then it can be argued that the firms’ corporate strategies are integrated. In other
              | words, given investment in firm specific assets, multinational production may be the best route to
              | exploit them, particularly as transport costs are high relative to the value of the product, making
              | price/quantity decisions more likely to be member state specific.
              | 3. Structural Change: Any Predictions
              | This section considers recent structural changes in the soft drinks industry.5 These are important
              | to consider in some detail in order to derive predictions in the light of the theoretical framework.
              | First, ‘europeanization’ is discussed, essentially understood as the effect of the Single European
              | Market (SEM). This predicted effect of the increase of market size on concentration is derived.
              | Secondly, we analyze the potential consequences of structural forces on corporate strategy. We
              | argue that increased multinationality is the likely outcome of the europeanization process, and this
              | will have an impact on the level of concentration in the market. In other words, we use the notion
              | of endogenous investment in a firm-specific asset to influence competition in the market.6
              | 4 Lyons, Matraves and Moffatt (1999) estimate a structural model of concentration and market size, developing an
              | econometric technique that endogenously determines whether the EU or the member state is the appropriate market
              | level for each country (thus consider the geographic dimension rather than the product dimension).
              | 5 Sutton separates out his analysis of CSDs and mineral water. We do not this as: i) on the demand side, mineral
              | water has recently become a direct substitute for CSDs; ii) more pragmatically, we use national statistics which are
              | typically compiled at the 3-digit level, although we do have some firm level evidence from company accounts.
              | 6 The notion of endogenous sunk costs has a direct parallel in the strategic management literature. When a firm
              | makes a large sunk investment, this commits them to certain strategies. If the industry is such that they expect rival
              | response, they may choose a certain investment to influence rival behavior (Thomas, 1996). For example, Thomas
              | shows, using the RTE breakfast cereal industry, that managers may be able to preempt rivals by introducing new
              | products with familiar brand names. Given sunk costs in advertising, incumbents have lower costs of product

              | Single European Market
              | By 1987, most tariff barriers had already been removed but many non-tariff barriers (NTBs)
              | remained. Buigues, Ilzkovitz and Lebrun (1990) identified the soft drinks industry as one with
              | high NTBs.7 Thus, various benefits from the SEM were expected. First come the direct benefits
              | associated with the reduction in the cost of trade, due mainly to the decrease in labeling and
              | packaging costs and the elimination of costs associated with importing. Secondly, and ex ante
              | difficult to predict, there were expected to be dynamic gains due to the increase in competitive
              | pressure. Allowing firms to compete directly with one another in a larger market was expected to
              | yield indirect benefits through increased efficiency, lower prices, and wider product variety.
              | These forces were not expected to affect all industries equally. Specific to the soft drinks market,
              | we emphasize that first, production economies of scale are relatively low and therefore, the
              | majority of firms were not previously operating at a cost disadvantage. Any efficiency benefits are
              | therefore likely to be low. Secondly, intra-EU trade has not significantly increased (moved from
              | 4% of production in 1987 to 6% in 1992, compared to the average of 13% in an advertising
              | intensive industry).
              | introduction which implies preemptive entry if withdrawal costs (in terms of harming the firm’s reputation) are
              | high.
              | 7 Representative examples include: i) 150 Italian municipalities banned plastic containers implying a significant
              | domestic advantage due to the lower incentive to import (high transport costs of glass); ii) until 1988, it was illegal
              | in France to sell ‘diet’ soft drinks that contained aspartame; iii) fiscal measures (e.g., VAT differences, excise
              | duties) that effectively discriminated against importers. Emerson et al (1988) estimate that in 1985, EU price
              | dispersion was 33.2% when all taxes were included (the average was 19.4% for consumer goods). The European
              | Commission estimated the benefits from eliminating: i) the plastic containers restriction as 15-50 million ECU per
              | year; ii) the aspartame restriction as 5 million ECU per year.

              | The continuing europeanization process increases effective market size as leading firms have
              | access to a wider geographical market. Table 1 shows the increase in actual market size due to
              | many factors including: i) the introduction of lightweight plastic bottles, and in particular, the use
              | of PET, which led to an expansion in capacity as the distribution range of the products could be
              | extended;8 ii) PET made possible the introduction of cheaper bulk packs which encouraged
              | domestic consumption; iii) the geographical spread of fast-food restaurants such as McDonalds;
              | and iv) consumer demand has increased in both market segments at the expense of alcoholic
              | drinks.9 Table 1 shows that between 1987 and 1993, the value of EU total soft drink production,
              | for example, increased from 11.3 to 18.2 billion ECU in 1993, although the growth rate has been
              | slowing since 1990.10 At current prices, the average annual growth rate in the overall EU market
              | between 1987 and 1993 was 8.4% for production (a real growth rate of 3.4%).11
              | 8 By 1993, 51% of soft drinks were sold in non-returnable plastic containers in the UK and 65% in Italy
              | (Panorama, 1995) The use of plastic is also increasing rapidly in other member states (apart from Germany due to
              | concern over environmental issues).
              | 9 Demand for mineral water has grown faster than that for CSDs in recent years, due mainly to its super-healthy
              | image (although diet carbonates and sports drinks have also benefited), and higher concern over tap water quality.
              | Diet drinks are underdeveloped in most member states, apart from the UK (30% market share compared to 10%,
              | on average, in the rest of the EU, Panorama, 1995).
              | 10 In 1984, EU market size was 8.8 billion ECU in current prices, compared with 23 billion for the US. By 1993,
              | the gap had considerably decreased, with EU market size estimated at 18.2 and the US at 21.9.

              | Table 2 shows market size by volume and by segment for the ‘Big 4’. Currently, the mineral water
              | segment accounts for approximately 40% of the EU market, but is far less important worldwide.
              | Focusing on intra-EU differences, the dominant market segment in the UK is CSDs, in Germany
              | the two segments are approximately equal, and in both France and Italy, mineral water dominates.
              | Reflecting the US pattern, the most popular carbonates flavor in all member states is cola, with a
              | share ranging from 41% in France to 49% in the UK to 56% in Greece (Panorama, 1995). Time
              | series evidence shows that over recent years, the volume of sales in the UK mineral water
              | segment has increased dramatically, although from a very low base, and consumption per capita
              | has almost trebled since 1990. In France and Italy, this pattern is completely reversed, the volume
              | increase in CSDs is substantially higher than in mineral water. Finally, in Germany, the volume
              | increases were almost equal. Table 2 provides some evidence that these two segments are
              | becoming closer substitutes over time. CSD manufacturers are also starting to focus on new types
              | of soft drinks that reflect changing consumer preferences towards bottled water and fruit juices

text          | (Beverage Industry, 1997). As market size increases, this raises the incentive to escalate
              | advertising expenditure (Sutton, 1991).12 This yields Hypothesis 1.
              | Hypothesis 1: an increase in market size is associated with an increase in the level of advertising
              | by each surviving firm that, in turn, will tend to increase concentration.
              | 3.2
              | Firms’ Competitive Actions: Changing Corporate Strategy
              | First, comes the impact of endogenous sunk costs. Our hypothesis is that the benefits of product
              | differentiation that lend themselves to advertising and associated firm specific talents, may lend
              | themselves to EU development, even if member state specific advertising campaigns are run. As
              | discussed in section two, if the integration of corporate strategy is an additional route to market
              | integration, firms may view their operations in different EU member states as interrelated, and
              | certain stages of the oligopoly game may be played at the EU level.
              | Thus, in Type 2 industries such as soft drinks, we cannot assume that integration will result in a
              | substantially less concentrated market. This is because the endogenous choice variable of
              | advertising is particularly sensitive to market size, and consequently, there may be little or no
              | intensification of price competition, with inter-firm rivalry, instead, being channeled into
              | endogenous fixed costs.13 Overall, our discussion highlights that, given the nature of the soft
              | drinks industry, we are not likely to observe increased integration through increased trade flows.
              | 12 The toughness of price competition has increased in the 1990s, in the sense that private label started to take
              | away market share. Cott Corp. offered comparable quality for its private label products, mostly colas, packaged the
              | brands well and sold them for 25% less than Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Cott also developed close relationships with
              | distributors (for example, Wal-Mart in the US, Sainsbury in the UK). It has been shown empirically only (the effect
              | is theoretically indeterminate) that an increase in the toughness of price competition will tend to increase
              | concentration irrespective of whether the industry is characterized by exogenous or endogenous sunk costs
              | (Symeonidis, 1997a, 1997b).
              | 13 Even when the product is not intrinsically tradable so markets are geographically segmented, if ‘taste’
              | differences are narrowing, then the oligopoly game will involve escalation in advertising at the EU or global level
              | and increased multi-market contact.

text          | Instead, the still separate markets (in terms of production) are likely to become dominated by the
              | same set of MNEs. This yields Hypothesis 2.
              | Hypothesis 2: the impact of the SEM will come through merger and acquisition activity and
              | increased geographic diversification. This will increase concentration at the EU level.
              | Carbonated Soft Drinks
              | CSDs are made from concentrate: either small to medium sized firms operating in a local or
              | regional market obtain syrup from specialist firms or multinational enterprises (MNEs) make their
              | own syrup and franchise a network of regional and/or national bottlers who add sweeteners and
              | carbonated water to produce and distribute the final product. Within the EU, Coca-Cola and
              | PepsiCo historically had their own networks where independent firms were authorized to bottle
              | and sell the products within certain geographical regions.14 Bottlers could handle more than one
              | brand, but not brands that were in direct competition with one another (i.e., a bottler could handle
              | Pepsi and Fanta but would not then handle Coca-Cola). However, the bottler received territorial
              | exclusivity over its specified region in return.
              | We argue that there are two important competitive factors associated with the creation of the
              | SEM that will impact the organizational structure of the CSD segment as described above. First
              | comes the impact on production and distribution. On the one hand, although NTBs have been
              | eliminated, it could be the case that due to territorial exclusivity constraints, the EU CSD market
              | will remain geographically segmented in production. If the EU market becomes the relevant
              | competitive market, on the other hand, then this existing distribution system of national or
              | 14 The franchisee provides the bottling and transportation equipment, the franchiser supplies the syrup. The
              | franchisor’s brand name is displayed throughout, and the franchisor also provides management expertise, in terms
              | of product quality control, marketing, advertising, etc.

text          | regional bottlers may be forced to change, even though products such as soft drinks are naturally
              | less traded, due to transport costs. Also, economies of scale in bottling have increased over time
              | due to better transportation systems, and the reduction in the use of returnable bottles (Muris et
              | al, 1992).15 This means that fewer bottlers are required to supply the market.
              | Muris et al (1992) argue that in the US, changes in the external environment increased the
              | transaction costs between the concentrate manufacturers and their bottlers.16 Also, the new
              | competitive environment required new product and marketing strategies, whose implementation
              | required the close cooperation of the distribution system. In turn, this favored vertical integration
              | over contracting.17 These arguments can equally be applied to the creation of the single market in
              | the EU, leading to vertical integration being the preferred corporate strategy. National and indeed,
              | European supermarket chains are growing, making coordination between the firm and a network
              | of bottlers more difficult, and so, expensive. Also, in recent years, the rate of new product
              | introductions has increased. It is easier if the CSD manufacturer owns the bottler to introduce the
              | new product than convince an independent to make the necessary firm-specific investment, as
              | most new introductions fail. This yields Hypothesis 3.
              | Hypothesis 3: increased competitive pressures will be positively associated with increased
              | vertical integration within the CSD segment.
              | 15 In the US, for example, the number of soft drink bottling plants has persistently decreased in 1950, there were
              | more than 6000 plants; this had declined to 3100 by 1970 (Katz, 1978), and 800 by 1990 (Muris et al, 1992).
              | 16 Historically, the value of CSDs relative to transport costs was low, and the use of returnable (and breakable)
              | containers required local manufacturing and a substantial local delivery system. Thus, despite substantial asset
              | specificity, it was not possible to effectively organize hundreds of manufacturing and distribution operations, given
              | the transportation and communication systems of that time.
              | 17 The one vital difference between Coca-Cola’s and Pepsi’s distribution system is that Pepsi’s franchise agreement
              | gave its bottlers exclusive perpetual rights to fountain sales (both had perpetual exclusive territories). This limited
              | Pepsi’s ability to negotiate such sales nationally and thus, their ability to compete effectively in the US fountain
              | market (Muris et al, 1992).

text          | Mineral Water
              | Mineral water producers are required by law to bottle at source (1984 EU directive), and are
              | therefore capacity constrained as compared to CSD firms in the sense that there is a finite supply
              | of water from each source. As with CSD producers, supply is typically characterized by a large
              | fringe who compete in a local/regional market, and MNEs.18 The same organizational franchising
              | system as observed in the CSD segment cannot be used in the mineral water segment due to the
              | legal requirement to bottle at source. This means that mineral water producers are forced to
              | export. Given the high transportation costs, this is likely to place a limit on the final market size.
              | This factor will tend to encourage multinationality as this is a route towards continued growth in
              | new markets.
              | 4.
              | Evidence
              | In this section, evidence is presented in support of Hypotheses 1-3. Hypothesis 1 states that in a
              | Type 2 industry, an increase in market size tends to be associated with an increase in advertising
              | expenditure and so, concentration. Hypothesis 2 states that the impact of the SEM will be to
              | increase the degree of multinationality at the firm level. This may have little impact on national
              | concentration as domestic incumbents are acquired but will have a significant effect on
              | concentration at the EU level, particularly if this is associated with pan-European advertising
              | campaigns.19 Hypothesis 3 states that an increase in competitive pressure is likely to have an
              | impact on how firms organize their production and distribution within the EU market in terms of
              | the degree of vertical integration.
              | 18 Note that the bottling technology is such that it would be difficult to obtain a technological advantage in
              | production in either segment.
              | 19 With the spread of satellite TV, we do already observe pan-European advertising for some soft drinks, e.g.,
              | Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Fanta, 7-Up or Orangina.

              | Table 4 shows that, consistent with Hypothesis 1, where market size is larger in a particular

              | France and Italy, and advertising is significantly higher than in CSDs. The reverse is true for the

meta          | 14
text          | mineral water segment than in cola. The real average annual growth rate for mineral water
              | between 1986 and 1989 was 63%, compared with 17% for cola. This is suggestive of a response
              | to the boom in demand for mineral water over the late 1980s.
              | The mineral water segment is particularly interesting as it may highlight a possible limitation of the
              | theoretical framework. Sutton (1991) showed that in France, the escalation of advertising outlays
              | by Perrier was very effective in increasing market share, and subsequently, other currently leading
              | brands were also heavily advertised. By contrast, nothing similar had occurred in the other major
              | European markets by 1986. Germany remained fragmented, and Italy lay in between in terms of
              | concentration although firms were advertising intensively in both countries, and market conditions
              | were similar in terms of market size and consumer demand. Sutton argued that mineral water is an
              | outlier. However, if cross-country structural differences do reflect variation in the effectiveness of
              | advertising to stimulate willingness to pay, then the theoretical framework is flawed. In other
              | words, the usefulness of the theory is crucially dependent on the assumption that the advertising
              | response function depends only on certain product characteristics which may be impossible to
              | proxy but determine the effectiveness of advertising in increasing demand.20 What the theoretical
              | framework is not consistent with is the notion that the advertising response function depends on
              | idiosyncratic features of a firm’s advertising campaign. This is because at the heart of the
              | empirical methodology lies the ability to categorize industries into those in which advertising can
              | increase perceived quality and those in which it cannot. If variation in concentration across the EU
              | 20 The advertising response function may also depend on observable institutional factors that differ across
              | countries, i.e. differences in regulation where TV advertising is more regulated in Europe than in the US; brand
              | advertising has never come close to US levels (Quelch and Harding, 1996). Also, there may exist cultural
              | differences.
meta          | 15
text          | member states can be directly linked with the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, then the
              | theory may be flawed.21
              | Consider Hypothesis 2 relating to an increase in the degree of multinationality and its consequent
              | impact on concentration. Within the CSD segment, we observe reorganization of firm structure
              | (see below); within the mineral water sector, due to the legal requirement of bottling at source,
              | and a limit on capacity, we should observe an increase in multinationality. We look first at the
              | most important cross-border merger and acquisition activity that has taken place since 1987.
              | Secondly, the corresponding impact on concentration is discussed.
              | The most important acquisition was that of Perrier by Nestlé in 1992, and the subsequent sale of
              | Volvic to the French firm, Danone (the firm was then called BSN) - the sale of Volvic was
              | stipulated by the European Commission, along with certain other conditions. This acquisition
              | fundamentally altered the EU mineral water segment. In 1987, the combined market share of the
              | top three firms was about 60%.22 Pre-merger, Perrier had considerable free capacity in the
              | majority of its sources, Nestlé was operating close to capacity in all its sources and in the case of
              | Danone, its still water brand, Evian, was not operating to maximum capacity, but its sparkling
              | water brand, Badoit, was. The sale of Volvic to Danone, with Nestlé retaining the Perrier sources,
              | gave both firms considerable extra capacity and more brands.23 Also, through the acquisition of
              | Perrier, Nestlé now controls major springs in a number of EU member states (e.g., Buxton in the
              | 21 Differences in concentration could arise from observing disequilibrium market structure in certain countries. If
              | this is true, German market structure may, over time, come to approximate the market structure observed in
              | France.
              | 22 As the demand for mineral water has increased, new springs have been opened, mainly by small firms
              | competing in price only. These local firms do not have a large enough market, due to the limitations imposed by
              | transport costs, to invest in advertising.
              | 23 Interestingly, Danone’s leading brands (Evian and Volvic) are both waters of low mineral content (< 500 mg per
              | liter) whereas Nestlé’s leading brands (Contrex, Vittel and Hépar) are waters of high mineral content (> 500 mg
meta          | 16
text          | UK). Therefore, any future EU-wide increase in demand could then be fulfilled by these two
              | firms. Post-merger, the 1993 combined market share of Nestlé and Danone was about 82% in
              | France, and approximately 35% of the overall EU mineral water market (Panorama, 1994).24
              | Focusing on other important EU markets in terms of size,25 in both Italy and Germany, the leading
              | brands are typically bottled in glass, substantially increasing the importance of transport costs. As
              | there exist few national retailers, this hinders the nationalization of the market due to
              | distributional problems. In Germany, 1993 mineral water consumption was higher than in France,
              | but the industry remains fragmented: the top four firms controlled approximately 25% of the
              | market. The leading firms are subsidiaries of major food and drink manufacturers (e.g. Apollinaris
              | is owned by a leading brewer, Brau und Brunnen; Blaue Quellen is owned by Nestlé). Although
              | the mineral water market segment is advertising intensive, there is comparatively little TV
              | advertising in contrast to CSDs. However, Euromonitor (1993) asserts that demand for premium
              | brands has risen in recent years, primarily due to their sophisticated yet healthy image.
              | Notwithstanding this, the production of mineral water remains dominated by relatively small
              | enterprises; only a few brands go beyond regional or even local boundaries. In Italy, since 1986,
              | as market size has increased, advertising has also increased, and the market has become more
              | concentrated over the past decade. Danone sold the Fabia and Sangemini brands to Terme Di
              | per liter). As a result of the merger, Danone and Nestlé have also succeeded in further segmenting the French
              | market horizontally (in terms of the product characteristics), as well as by perceived quality.
              | 24 Since 1987, Danone has expanded substantially in Spain and Italy; and Nestlé in Germany and Italy (acquiring
              | San Bernardo in 1993, and 25% of San Pellegrino through Perrier).
              | 25 In the UK, Perrier was the leading brand in 1987, with the highest advertising and a 60% market share. Market
              | size has been rapidly increasing, although from a very small base. As mineral water production is low-tech, new
              | firms can enter relatively easily which has contributed to the strong own-label growth (accounting for 42% of 1993
              | sales in the grocery sector). In 1993, advertising was as follows: Evian=£0.7m; Highland Spring=Volvic=£0.69m;
              | Perrier=£0.44m. As the theoretical framework predicts, such expenditures are reflected in the firms’ market
              | shares. It is estimated that Evian is now the market leader in terms of volume, with a market share of 11.2%, then
              | Buxton with 6.5%, Volvic with 6.1%, and Highland Spring with 5.8% (Key Note, 1994). Perrier now has only a
              | 3.9% market share (although it still has a high price premium).

              | Looking now at changes in concentration, both Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 predict an increase
              | in concentration. Table 5 shows that in the overall 3-digit industry, we observe varying trends in
              | concentration among the member states. Concentration has increased by 2.3 percentage points in
              | the EU which is quite a large change over a relatively short time period, and in line with our
              | a priori expectations.26
              | At the national level, using the official published statistics, concentration has slightly increased in
              | Germany and has remained stable in France. In Italy, concentration has decreased by 10%. The
              | biggest increase in concentration is observed in the UK where concentration has significantly
              | increased over this seven year period. It is clear that no systematic pattern exists. This is what we
              | would expect because if competition is taking place at the EU level, there should exist no
              | systematic pattern at the national level. Indeed, if integration is manifested through increased

              | and an increase in concentration at the EU level.
              | Hypothesis 3 linked increasing competitive pressure and reorganization of the franchise network
              | in order to better exploit the wider market and expand internationally. We argued that leading
              | firms were more likely to vertically integrate to exploit the new market opportunities. This is
              | observed in the data, particularly in the case of Coca-Cola, giving the firm direct control over the
              | distribution and marketing of the product.
              | In France, for example, Pernod-Ricard used to hold the Coca-Cola franchise. Coca-Cola was
              | dissatisfied with sales because: i) CSD market size was very small compared with other EU
              | markets; ii) Coca-Cola was not the market leader. Coca-Cola’s main objectives in taking over
              | bottling were to improve its distribution system and customer relationships, and sales have
              | dramatically increased since. The 1993 company report shows that over the past 5 years, the
              | average annual growth rate (volume) was 15%, compared with an industry average of 9%.
              | In Germany, a wholly-owned subsidiary manages a national network of local bottlers. In 1983,
              | there were more than 100 bottlers franchised; by 1989, this number was 61.27 This indicates, as
              | also observed in the US market, the movement towards consolidation as the market became more
              | mature. Coca-Cola dominates the German market with a 1996 volume market share of 56%,
              | compared to Pepsi’s 5% and is also the largest advertiser, mainly via television (Euromonitor,
              | 1993). Coca-Cola also dominates the Italian market (48% volume market share in 1996)
              | 27 Traditionally, most bottling plants were under the control of the brewers, of whom there are hundreds as they
              | were protected by the German beer purity laws. However, following the EU decision that the beer purity law is

              | an established mineral water producer, began to bottle Pepsi and 7-Up.
              | UK market structure was radically altered in 1986 when two new ventures were formed: i) a JV
              | between Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages (hereafter, CCSB); ii) a merger between the soft
              | drinks businesses of Britvic and Britannia Soft Drinks, forming Britvic.28 The main incentive was
              | that the market was becoming national rather than regional (equivalent to an increase in effective
              | market size), and retail chains and other buyers wanted to do business with one national rather
              | than many regional suppliers.29 Also, using several bottlers meant that marketing incentives were
              | lessened as advertising efforts would, in part, be appropriated by other firms.
              | A 1991 Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) inquiry found that CCSB had a 42.7%
              | share by market value and Britvic a 22.4% market share. Since 1987, Britvic had increased their
              | market share from 19.5%, but at the expense of smaller firms, rather than CCSB.30 It was
              | estimated that the number of firms operating in the UK was 100, compared with the 1986
              | estimate of 270 firms (Sutton, 1991). By 1993, the number of firms operating in the UK was
              | 28 At this point in time, CCSB controlled the Coca-Cola, Fanta and Lilt brands, and also Schweppes, Russchian,
              | etc., giving them a presence in most market niches; since 1990, they have considerably expanded abroad, acquiring
              | Perrier’s non-water interests to give a strong position in Spain and France. Britvic is the only other UK firm to
              | produce a full range, including Pepsi and 7-Up, with a far stronger position in the licensed trade due to connections
              | with leading brewers.
              | 29 In the UK, the top 5 supermarkets account for 62% of sales, versus 21% in the US; 54% of Sainsbury’s sales
              | come from own-brand labels (Quelch and Harding, 1996). When Sainsbury’s Classic was first introduced in 1994,
              | 2 liters cost 59 pence versus 105 pence for Coke; Coca-Cola’s market share initially slumped from 63% to 33% in
              | Sainsbury supermarkets. In 1995, own-label cola took 65% of total cola sales in Sainsbury and 15% of the total UK
              | cola market (Quelch and Harding, 1996).
              | 30 In 1993, Britvic/PepsiCo launched a new brand, Pepsi Max, a diet cola with a trendy appeal, spending £3.5m on
              | advertising. This was the first time PepsiCo had launched a new product in any other market apart from the US,
              | first introducing it in Scotland. By contrast, CCSB spent only £1.2m on its diet brand, Diet Coca-Cola. Thus, an
              | absolutely higher amount was spent by Britvic/PepsiCo and Pepsi Max immediately took a 10% market share, and
              | accounted for 20% of Pepsi’s UK sales by the end of 1995. The observed successful strategy is not to compete with
              | Coca-Cola on exactly the same product, but instead to innovate, to develop new market niches. Britvic also
              | introduced a new innovative and award winning advertising campaign for its Tango brand, highlighting its tangy
              | orange flavor. The packaging was also redesigned, and the brand increased its market share.

text          | further reduced to 70 (Panorama, 1995). The evidence on the number of firms is consistent with
              | the Sutton hypothesis that the less efficient firms or the large fringe of small firms can no longer
              | compete as advertising expenditure escalates. The firms escalating their expenditure will break
              | free from the rest of the pack, and either merger and/or exit takes place. In 1996, Coca-Cola
              | bought out the franchise agreement, ending the 10 year old UK joint venture, and consistent with
              | Hypothesis 2, this shows further evidence of forward vertical integration.
              | In 1997, Coca-Cola created a new ‘anchor bottler’ in the Nordic countries called Coca-Cola
              | Nordic Beverages to serve Denmark, Sweden and Norway. This was a joint venture between
              | Coca-Cola (49%) and Carlsberg A/S (51%). In 1998, the largest Coca-Cola bottler outside North
              | America was split into two companies. Coca-Cola Amatil Limited of Australia which had
              | expanded to include operations in 18 countries on three continents spun off its European bottling
              | operations as a separate publicly listed company, Coca-Cola Beverages (Coca-Cola owns 50%).31

              | Summary and Conclusions
              | The main objective of this industry case was to assess the effect of European integration on the
              | competitive process in the soft drinks industry, applying the new theory of industrial structure as
              | developed most fully in Sutton (1991). Our results showed first that as market size increased, so
              | too did advertising expenditure, although not faster than market size. Secondly, an increase in
              | concentration was observed at the EU level, and no systematic pattern was observed at the
              | national level. We predicted that market integration would have differential effects on the two
              | 31 1997: Coca-Cola Enterprises is the world’s largest bottler, accounting for over half of all Coke products bottled
              | in the US (44% owned by Coca-Cola in 1997). Pepsi bottling operations accounted for 52% of Pepsi’s soft drink
              | sales in the US.
meta          | 21
text          | major segments within the soft drinks industry in the way that firms responded. Undertaking such
              | a case study allowed us to assess how different structural features impacted the way that firms
              | respond to the underlying Type 2 industry nature.
              | Within the mineral water segment, firms are capacity constrained by the legal requirement of
              | bottling at source. Market size has been increasing over the past decade across all member states
              | (starting from a very low base in the UK). Both the French and Italian market structures have
              | been characterized by increasing consolidation, and the extent of MNE activity has also rapidly
              | increased. It was argued (Sutton, 1991) that the French market was relatively stable. We believe
              | that one of the major reasons the Nestlé-Perrier merger took place was in order to exploit the
              | Perrier brand name across the entire EU. In general, it is difficult for advertising campaigns to be
              | transferable across borders, if only because of language difficulties, but it may be easier to transfer
              | management expertise. Thus, the EU may become unified through integration of corporate
              | strategy. As observed in the data, MNEs such as Nestlé and Danone are acquiring mineral water
              | springs in various member states; distribution is limited only by the degree of transport costs.
              | Within the CSD segment, we then investigated the extent of a first-mover advantage. We showed
              | that market size increased, raising the incentive for PepsiCo and other CSD firms to escalate their
              | advertising expenditure. If other soft drink firms such as PepsiCo do begin to heavily advertise
              | their products as market size increases, but Coca-Cola does not lose market share, then we can
              | conclude that the first-mover advantage must be stronger than the market size effect. On the other
              | hand, if we were to observe an erosion in Coca-Cola’s market share, this would suggest that other
              | firms are successfully convincing consumers that the (perceived) quality of their products is higher
              | than Coca-Cola. In all member states, Coca-Cola has not been losing market share. Only in the
meta          | 22
text          | UK market is PepsiCo succeeding in persuading consumers to buy their product, with the
              | introduction and subsequent intensive advertising of their innovative product, Pepsi Max.
              | Interestingly, this implies that the first-mover advantage is stronger than the market size effect.
              | In conclusion, we have shown that the soft drinks industry is currently in transition, becoming
              | increasingly dominated by MNEs who make decisions based on overall opportunities within the
              | European market. Thus, this case study suggests that trade integration is not the only route to
              | market integration. Integration of corporate strategy through multinationality is an additional way.
