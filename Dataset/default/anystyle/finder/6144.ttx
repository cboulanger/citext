              | ABSTRACT
              | This paper investigates how one particular aspect of the freedom
              | of movement of capital – the right of EU residents to acquire real estate
              | in EU member states – might shape Croatia’s EU accession negotia-
              | tions and affect its real estate market, the tourism industry and the
              | national economy. It identifies potential benefits and risks of unrestrict-
              | ed foreign investment in Croatian real estate, and attendant dilemmas
              | for economic policies. The main conclusion is that Croatia stands to
              | benefit in the long run from foreign investment in the property sector.
              | However, a gradual approach to the opening-up of the real estate mar-
              | ket to non-residents can be justified on a number of grounds. These
              | include inadequate legislation limiting property speculation; potential
              | spillovers of price increases from the market for secondary residences

              | INTRODUCTION
              | Since Croatia became an official EU candidate in June 2004,
              | public discussions on the benefits and costs of accession have intensi-
              | fied in many areas. This paper addresses four issues that have attracted
              | particular attention: How quickly should EU residents get unrestricted
              | access to Croatia’s property market? How will this affect – or is this
              | already affecting – the local housing market? What will be the impact
              | on Croatia’s tourism? And what are the likely macroeconomic effects
              | of foreign investment inflows into Croatia’s real estate? As is often the
              | case, serious research has yet to catch up with the enormous public
              | interest in these issues. This paper is therefore a first attempt to analyse
              | the issues in a systematic manner and provide guidance for future work
              | in this area. The main purpose is to stimulate analysis and policy think-
              | ing on these important issues ahead of the upcoming accession negoti-
              | ations with the EU.
              | Section 2 analyses Croatia’s obligations under Chapter 4 of the
              | acquis, Freedom of movement of capital, paying particular attention to
              | the right of EU residents to invest in real estate in candidate countries,
              | and discusses Croatia’s current regime for property sales to foreigners.
              | The current regime is rather restrictive, non-transparent and cumber-
              | some in some respects, but relatively liberal in others. However, a more
              | important issue is that this regime will eventually have to be aban-
              | doned, thus exposing the economy to potentially large-scale foreign
              | property investments. For under EU law, EU citizens have unrestricted

text          | rights to buy as much property as they like in any EU country without
              | any need to reside in that country. This means that non-residents will
              | not be restricted to buying only secondary residences as at present, but
              | will also be able to buy property for speculative purposes, against
              | which there is currently only weak protection in the Croatian legisla-
              | tion. Against this background, Section 2 investigates how Croatia can
              | improve its negotiating position on this issue. Drawing on the experi-
              | ence of Denmark and Malta, the section highlights the importance of
              | the expertise and negotiating skills of officials engaged in accession
              | talks with the EU. It notes, however, the difficulty of articulating the
              | view that EU residents should not be allowed to acquire property in
              | Croatia for an extended period of time, and the importance of strength-
              | ening legislation to protect against property speculation.
              | Section 3 analyses potential implications of foreign investment
              | in real estate for the local housing market. It discusses the main charac-
              | teristics of Croatia’s real estate market and reviews recent develop-
              | ments in housing prices. It finds some empirical evidence that increased
              | demand for secondary residences by foreigners has led to an increase in
              | prices of houses and land for construction on the Adriatic. It also analy-
              | ses factors that might determine the effects of foreign property invest-
              | ment on the housing market in the future. These effects will depend on
              | the speed with which the property market is liberalised; capacity con-
              | straints and competition in the construction industry; the speed with
              | which legal impediments to property sales are removed; and develop-
              | ments in household incomes, housing finance and other factors influ-
              | encing the affordability of housing. Given the likely supply rigidities,
              | the section argues that a gradual approach to the opening of the real
              | estate market to non-residents would allow for a more orderly adjust-
              | ment than a rapid removal of restrictions.
              | Section 4 considers how increased foreign investment in real
              | estate could influence Croatia’s tourism industry. To provide insights
              | into this question, the section analyses the size and main features of
              | Croatia’s tourism industry. The question that seems particularly rele-
              | vant in this context is whether accession to the EU offers the opportu-
              | nity for tourism to assume a leading role in overall economic develop-
              | ment, or represents a threat to one of its main assets, the unspoilt coastal
              | environment. On balance, Croatian tourism stands to benefit from for-
              | eign property investment. The key will be to avoid the risk of overde-
              | velopment, that is, to ensure strict enforcement of existing building reg-
              | ulations and of the recently adopted legislation on the protection on the

text          | public coastal domain. Greater foreign ownership of secondary resi-
              | dences could increase the attractiveness of the Adriatic coast and
              | islands for other tourists and over the longer term perhaps contribute to
              | the economic and demographic revival of many now dormant or aban-
              | doned communities.
              | Section 5 analyses diverse macroeconomic effects that
              | increased foreign investment in real estate would have for the Croatian
              | economy. The wealth effect has already been in evidence for some
              | time, as the value of houses and land in areas that are attracting foreign
              | buyers has increased considerably over the past few years. Due to
              | potentially large capital inflows associated with non-resident real
              | estate purchases, the section elaborates several arguments for a grad-
              | ual opening-up of the market.
              | Section 6 summarises the main conclusions and elaborates a
              | number of policy recommendations.
              | FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL
              | The EU internal market is based on the principle of the “four
              | freedoms” of movement: of goods, services, capital and people. As a
              | general rule, the EU is not willing to accept candidate countries'
              | requests to limit these freedoms because this could have a significant
              | impact on competition and the functioning of the internal market.
              | Croatia – as all EU candidates before it – will thus have to allow basi-
              | cally unrestricted movement of goods, services, capital and people by
              | the time it accedes to the EU. The Treaty Establishing the European
              | Community (Article 56) prohibits in particular all restrictions on move-
              | ment of capital between member states but also between the member
              | states and third countries, although certain restrictions in relation to
              | countries outside the EU can be retained.
              | Freedom of movement of capital is defined in Chapter 4 of the
              | acquis communitaire. It covers not only payments and transfers of
              | money across borders, but also transfers of ownership of assets and lia-
              | bilities (such as investments in companies and real estate or portfolio
              | investments) and directives on prevention of money laundering. This
              | paper discusses only one type of capital movement – the right of EU
              | residents to purchase real estate in Croatia. Croatia’s obligations in this
              | regard are currently defined in the Stabilization and Association
              | Agreement (SAA), (Article 60, point 2):

text          | “As from the entry into force of this Agreement, Croatia
              | shall authorise, by making full and expedient use of its existing pro-
              | cedures, the acquisition of real estate in Croatia by nationals of
              | Member States of the European Union, except for areas and matters
              | listed in Annex VII.i Within four years from the entry into force of
              | this Agreement, Croatia shall progressively adjust its legislation
              | concerning the acquisition of real estate in Croatia by nationals of
              | the Member States of the European Union to ensure the same treat-
              | ment as compared to Croatian nationals. At the end of the fourth
              | year after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Stabilisation
              | and Association Council shall examine the modalities for extending
              | these rights to the areas and matters listed in Annex VII.”
              | By the time Croatia joins the EU, the SAA will be superseded
              | by an Accession Treaty. Although the Treaty will be largely based on
              | the SAA, it may treat a number of issues differently. The whole purpose
              | of accession negotiations is precisely to agree under what conditions
              | Croatia will accept, apply and administratively and legally implement
              | different chapters of the acquis. Commitments under the SAA regard-
              | ing non-residents’ right to purchase property in Croatia thus can and, as
              | argued in this paper, probably should be re-negotiated in the process of
              | Croatia’s accession to the EU.
              | What is the current situation regarding the acquisition of real
              | estate in Croatia by non-residents? Private non-resident individuals can
              | already become owners of real estate in Croatia (other than by inheri-
              | tance) after obtaining permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
              | They are restricted to one property, which is limited in size (the con-
              | struction site cannot exceed 1,500 m2), and there are areas in which
              | they may not acquire property, such as protected natural areas, agricul-
              | tural land, forests and forest land and certain excluded areas.ii Key
              | issues in the application procedure, which can reportedly take up to a
              | year, are the approval of the transaction by the Ministry of Justice and
              | the existence of a reciprocity agreement on real estate purchases
              | between Croatia and a given non-resident’s home country.iii For
              | instance, US residents may be granted permission to buy property in
              | Croatia because Croatian citizens can acquire property in the United
              | States without restriction. In contrast, private individuals from Slovenia
              | cannot acquire property in Croatia because Slovenia and Croatia do not
              | have a reciprocity agreement in this area.iv
              | According to the official data quoted by the news media, 3,200
              | foreign residents have obtained permission to buy real estate in Croatia

text          | since 1996, when the property market was first opened to foreigners
              | (Table 1).v Less than 40% of applications have since been approved,
              | 7% have been rejected, and over half have not yet been processed.vi The
              | number of applications has varied from around 550 per year during
              | 1996-99, to around 1,250 per year since 2000.
              | In addition to private non-resident individuals, non-residents who
              | set up a Croatian company can also acquire property in Croatia. In this
              | case there is no need for government permission to buy the property
              | (although there are various other legal and financial considerations) and
              | the buyer is not restricted to one piece of property. There is no official
              | information on the number of companies set up for this purpose. However,
              | since establishing a company normally takes much less than one year and
              | is not costly, there are indications that many foreigners (in particular from
              | countries such as Slovenia that do not have reciprocity agreements) make
              | use of this alternative to acquire real estate in Croatia.vii

              | The existing regime for property sales to foreigners can thus be
              | characterised as relatively restrictive, non-transparent and cumbersome
              | in some respects, but relatively liberal in others. In particular, it is not
              | clear why the processing of applications takes so long and why the cri-
              | teria used in evaluating the applications are not transparent and public.
              | On the other hand, it is important to recognise that current arrange-
              | ments with respect to the sale of property to third country residents are
              | already more liberal than the EU legislation requires: not just EU
              | nationals, but residents of any country where Croatian citizens have the
              | right to acquire property can in principle become owners of real estate
              | in Croatia. Moreover, residents of virtually any country can buy prop-
              | erty if they register a Croatian company.

text          | How will these arrangements change with implementation of the
              | SAA and Croatia’s accession to the EU? The main change is that, upon
              | expiration of the four-year transitional period agreed in the SAA (or
              | perhaps a longer period yet to be negotiated during accession talks), EU
              | residents will have the right to buy real estate in Croatia without any
              | restriction. This means that they will not be restricted to buying only
              | secondary residences or just one piece of property, and will not be sub-
              | ject to other conditions, such as prior approval, size, or use of the prop-
              | erty. Under EU law, EU citizens have full rights to buy as much prop-
              | erty as they like in any EU country without any need to reside in that
              | country. This means that non-residents can also buy property for spec-
              | ulative purposes, unless this is limited by domestic legislation, which is
              | largely not the case in Croatia at present.
              | It is not clear whether these implications of EU accession are
              | clear to the Croatian public and to policy makers. In any case, they
              | have not yet been articulated in public discussion. The real issue is
              | that the existing restrictions on real estate sales to foreigners, how-
              | ever imperfect, will eventually have to be lifted, thus exposing the
              | economy to foreign property investments of potentially far greater
              | magnitude than anything that has been observed so far. This raises
              | the question of whether the authorities could or should do something
              | to keep the existing restrictions in place for more than four years, and
              | how to better protect in the meantime against property speculation.viii
              | At present, commercially motivated property sales in the sec-
              | ondary market are subject to income tax only if the sale occurs with-
              | in three years from the purchase of the property. Part of the capital
              | gains from such sales is not taxed.ix There seem to be no additional
              | regulations preventing speculation in the market for land or uncom-
              | pleted property. For instance, an entrepreneur could buy up large
              | swathes of land for construction, or batches of uncompleted apart-
              | ments and houses, in the expectation that prices will rise rapidly due
              | to limited supply, and then resell at a higher price. While the entre-
              | preneur would pay the regular profits tax, the tax authorities would
              | not be in a position, as in most mature market economies, to make a
              | judgement about the fair value of such transactions, and, hence, any
              | extra profits earned by the entrepreneur due to speculative activity.
              | The lack of capital largely prevents Croatian citizens from engaging
              | in such activities at the moment, so the weakness of anti-speculative
              | regulations may not be obvious. But once the property market is
              | opened up to non-residents, the lack of capital will no longer con-

text          | strain this type of activities, and the weakness of the legislation could
              | manifest itself very quickly, resulting in the meantime in potentially
              | large disruptions in local property markets. The remainder of this
              | section considers only the first issue – whether the authorities could
              | or should do something to keep in place the existing restrictions on
              | property sales to non-residents. The issue of anti-speculative legisla-
              | tion requires a separate expert analysis that goes beyond the scope of
              | the present paper.
              | How have other candidate countries handled the issue of transi-
              | tional periods for real estate purchases in their accession negotiations?
              | The biggest issue in most cases turned out to be the right to purchase
              | land. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and
              | Slovakia requested 10-18 year moratoria on the sales of land to EU res-
              | idents (Table 2). They justified the need for moratoria by several social
              | and economic factors, including the high share of the population work-
              | ing in agriculture; underdeveloped land markets; significantly lower
              | land prices in candidate countries than in the EU-15; and substantially
              | lower average income of domestic population relative to EU nationals,
              | which would give EU nationals an unfair advantage in purchasing agri-
              | cultural land in new member states.x
              | Recognising the high political sensitivity of this issue, the
              | European Commission proposed in May 2001 that the candidate coun-
              | tries should be allowed to limit the acquisition of agricultural land by
              | other EU nationals during a transitional period of seven years after their
              | accession to the EU (European Commission, 2001a).xi During this peri-
              | od, the candidate countries would have to use objective, stable, trans-
              | parent and public criteria for the authorisation procedures for land
              | acquisitions. The Commission also proposed a review, to take place
              | after three years, to determine whether this transitional period could be
              | shortened or even lifted.
              | The Commission’s proposal was perceived as a trade-off on a
              | broader issue of far greater importance to the EU-15, that is, between
              | the demand of the EU-15 for 5-7 year transition periods for the free
              | movement of workers from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and
              | the candidates’ demand for longer transition periods for land pur-
              | chases by non-residents. Most candidate countries endorsed and
              | eventually adopted the Commission’s proposal (Table 2). The only
              | exception was Poland, which insisted on a longer transition period
              | fearing that foreign residents might buy relatively cheaply its abun-
              | dant reserves of agricultural land. As Poland has by far the largest
              | mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 193
meta          | 193
text          | population among the new member states and at the same time there
              | were fears in some old members of the EU that Polish workers might
              | crowd out domestic labour after the accession, the Polish authorities
              | managed to negotiate a 12-year moratorium on land purchases by
              | non-residents in exchange for a seven-year transition period for the
              | free movement of Polish workers to most EU countries.xii Most coun-
              | tries also negotiated the possibility to extend the seven-year transi-
              | tional period by another three years if a special safeguard clause is
              | invoked.
              | The right of EU nationals to purchase secondary residences in
              | candidate countries was considerably less controversial. Cyprus, the
              | Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia requested five-year transition-
              | al periods, mostly citing concerns about the impact of large-scale real
              | estate purchases by foreign residents on the prices and affordability of
              | local housing. The Baltic countries, Bulgaria and Slovenia, allowed EU
              | residents to purchase secondary residences even before their accession
              | talks and therefore requested no transitional arrangements at all,
              | although Slovenia negotiated the right to invoke a general economic
              | safeguard clause to protect its real estate sector over a period of seven
              | years. Against this background, it is interesting that some media report-
              | ed a different interpretation of Slovenia’s position, according to which
              | Slovenia tried but did not manage to negotiate a transitional period for
              | real estate purchases.xiii
              | The European Commission’s proposal for a five-year transi-
              | tional period for secondary residences was eventually adopted by all
              | new member states except Malta, which presented a special problem.
              | Malta’s case is instructive and deserves particular attention because
              | of some similarities on this issue with the current situation in Croatia
              | (see Box 1).
              | Another interesting example is Denmark. Foreigners are free to
              | buy real estate in Denmark for business and primary residence purpos-
              | es (subject to certain residency restrictions), but not as secondary
              | homes. In particular, foreigners cannot own holiday homes along the
              | Danish coast – such properties can only be rented out. This restriction
              | dates back to the mid-1960s, when Denmark was not yet in the EU and
              | there were fears that foreigners might buy holiday properties on the
              | coast for speculative purposes. To prevent speculation, non-residents
              | were not allowed to own vacation homes that are kept unoccupied most
              | of the year. Upon accession in 1973, Denmark was allowed to keep this
              | restriction.xiv

              | In summary, the cases of Malta and Denmark, along with the
              | Polish extension of the period for agricultural land purchases by non-
              | residents, illustrate that the scope for adopting solutions suiting the
              | interests of candidate countries is not limited ex ante and depends,
              | among other things, on the expertise and negotiating skills of public
              | servants engaged in accession talks with the EU.xv Nevertheless, one

text          | should not underestimate the difficulty of negotiations on this point.
              | The arguments for either the Maltese or the Danish exemption may not
              | be easily applied to Croatia. Moreover, as discussed in the conclusion,
              | no country can expect to benefit from the rights of membership if at the
              | same time it does not want to shoulder the obligations. The challenge in
              | this particular case will be, first, to identify an important national inter-
              | est (if any) in postponing the liberalisation of the real estate market for
              | non-residents; and second, to demonstrate that applying unrestricted
              | rights of EU residents to acquire property in Croatia would go against
              | this interest for an extended period of time. One obvious candidate for
              | such an interest is the need to limit property speculation. Such a move
              | would not go against the spirit of EU accession because other EU mem-
              | ber countries have such legislation. The sections that follow elaborate
              | several other economic arguments that tend to support the case for a
              | more gradual approach to the liberalisation of the property market.
              | Box 1 How did Malta negotiate an exemption from the com-
              | plete liberalisation of real estate sales to European Union
              | residents?
              | As in Croatia, non-residents – including from non-EU coun-
              | tries – could acquire property in Malta even before the country’s
              | accession to the EU. Restrictions on property sales were similar to
              | those presently used in Croatia – the sale required prior approval,
              | only one secondary residence of limited size could be acquired by
              | non-residents, and the value of property had to be above a certain
              | limit. The rationale for these restrictions was to retain a measure of
              | control on land use and to prevent speculation. Foreigners could
              | acquire additional property in Malta beyond the secondary resi-
              | dence only if they obtained Maltese nationality.
              | During accession talks, Malta requested to be able to keep
              | these restrictions on a permanent basis. The authorities were in par-
              | ticular concerned that if EU residents had unrestricted access to the
              | real estate in their small island country, this could lead to more
              | widespread economic and social problems. They supported their
              | case by several well-founded arguments.
              | First, they argued that, with population of 395,000 and ter-
              | ritory of just 316 km2 (by comparison, Croatian islands of Braè and
              | Hvar have surface areas of 395 km2 and 300 km2, respectively),
              | Malta was by far the most densely populated country in the EU-25.
              | As a result, land available for construction could only cover the
              | basic needs of the local population.

meta          | 196
text          | Second, they argued that, if the right of EU citizens to buy
              | property in Malta after membership led to an increase in demand for
              | property, this could affect property prices and have a negative social
              | impact on Maltese families, especially on young couples. While
              | housing affordability is not only affected by EU membership – the
              | property prices have been rising in Malta for many years – Malta’s
              | concern was that EU membership should not add to the problem by
              | making housing even less affordable.
              | Third, they argued that concerns about housing affordabili-
              | ty in their densely populated country were permanent because,
              | should a problem arise, it would be greater in future than at present,
              | affecting future generations more than the current ones. This is why
              | a transitional period was not sufficient for Malta: only a permanent
              | arrangement was acceptable.
              | The European Commission accepted these arguments and
              | the EU eventually agreed that Malta may maintain, on a permanent
              | but non-discriminatory basis, the existing restrictions on the right of
              | EU citizens to acquire just one secondary residence in Malta.
              | However, after residing in Malta for at least five years, EU citizens
              | will be allowed to buy additional property beyond the secondary
              | residence. The five-year residence requirement was the balance that
              | was struck between the two diametrically opposed positions in
              | Maltese and EU law. Under Maltese law, foreigners can never have
              | full rights to buy property in Malta – that is, to buy property other
              | than one secondary residence – unless they obtain Maltese nation-
              | ality. On the other hand, under EU law, EU citizens have full rights
              | to buy as much property as they like in any EU country without any
              | need to reside in that country.

              | IMPLICATIONS FOR CROATIA’S REAL
              | ESTATE MARKET
              | To understand the broader economic implications of a more lib-
              | eral regime for the acquisition of property by foreigners, it is necessary
              | first to consider some basic features of the real estate market in Croatia.
              | One should note from the outset that there is very little published
              | research on the economics of the Croatian property market.xvi
              | Moreover, statistical data on the real estate market are very patchy.

text          | Given the many transformations of this market (for instance, from
              | state-owned, to company- and socially-owned, to privately-owned
              | housing) and institutional differences with western European and for-
              | mer socialist countries, an empirical research programme on the eco-
              | nomics of the real estate market would be extremely useful for
              | researchers, policy makers and the real estate industry. This section can
              | in no way fill this gap; it will only attempt to outline those features of
              | the real estate market that might be relevant in the course of Croatia’s
              | EU accession.
              | The real estate market is usually one of the most closely watched
              | sectors in mature market economies. It plays a crucial role not only
              | because housing accounts for the bulk of the personal wealth, but also
              | because of linkages with key investment, saving, and consumption
              | choices of households and businesses. In addition, the real estate mar-
              | ket affects competitiveness as a major input in the productive capacity,
              | in particular in service oriented economies such as Croatia’s, and as an
              | important determinant of banking and equity market performance, both
              | of which are highly affected by movements in property prices.
              | The real estate market in Croatia is still relatively small – con-
              | struction and real estate industries account for around 13% of GDP,
              | compared with 20-25% of GDP in many industrial countries, indicating
              | considerable potential for future growth. The real estate market started
              | to develop in earnest in the second half of the 1990s, after most of the
              | housing and commercial property stock inherited from the socialist
              | period had been privatised. Privatisation of housing led to an increase
              | in the already high proportion of both privately-owned and owner-
              | occupied housing. According to the 2001 Census, 96% of the 1.4 mil-
              | lion permanently occupied dwellings in Croatia are owned by private
              | individuals, and 83% are owner-occupied dwellings.xvii For compari-
              | son, in western Europe the share of housing owned by private individ-
              | uals ranges from about 60% in Austria and Sweden to 90-95% in
              | Belgium, Greece, Spain and Portugal; while the share of owner-occu-
              | pied housing ranges from 38% in Germany to 80% in Ireland (OECD,
              | 2001).xviii Croatia is in this respect similar to some other CEE countries,
              | where privatisation has also resulted in a high level of owner-occupied
              | housing.xix
              | There is little reliable information about the state of the housing
              | stock in Croatia. Comparing the total number of households (1.48 mil-
              | lion) with the number of permanently occupied dwellings indicates a
              | small deficit in the housing stock (about 56,000 dwellings in 2001).xx

text          | However, if one considers the additional stock of about 200,000
              | dwellings that are temporarily unoccupied, the number of dwellings
              | exceeds the number of households by about 10%.xxi
              | The picture on the regional distribution of the housing stock is
              | also unclear. The Ministry of Environmental Protection, Physical
              | Planning and Construction (MZOUP, 2003:35) argues that there is a sig-
              | nificant shortage of housing in middle-sized and large cities, and at the
              | same time a significant surplus of housing in small towns. Large differ-
              | ences in apartment prices between cities such as Zagreb and Karlovac
              | would tend to support this view. However, Tica (2004) argues that if
              | temporarily unoccupied dwellings are counted, all Croatian counties,
              | including the city of Zagreb, have a surplus in the housing stock.
              | Regarding housing supply, defined here as the flow of new
              | housing (the “primary” market) plus sales of existing homes (the “sec-
              | ondary” market), the available data suggest that supply in the primary
              | market is relatively tight. During 1996-2001, about 13,600 dwellings
              | were on average completed each year.xxii To compare this figure with
              | just one segment of the potential demand for housing, there were on
              | average 70% more marriages (about 23,000) each year during this peri-
              | od. In international comparison, with an average of 3 newly completed
              | dwellings per 1,000 inhabitants during 1996-2001, Croatia is near the
              | bottom relative to western Europe, although it compares favourably
              | with other central and eastern European countries (Figure 1).

text          | Although there are no comprehensive data on sales in the sec-
              | ondary market, the available indicators suggest that the supply is con-
              | strained in this market as well. Perhaps the most important reason is
              | that many properties – including many of those temporarily unoccupied
              | – do not have clean titles, so many potential trades cannot be realised.
              | As discussed below, this state of affairs is due to huge backlogs in the
              | judiciary, the often chaotic state of property registers and deficiencies
              | in urban planning and the enforcement of building relations.
              | Furthermore, much of the housing stock has been privatised to
              | occupiers for nominal payments or at no cost. Privatisation thus result-
              | ed in windfall gains according to who happened to be living in a
              | dwelling at the time. Many people therefore occupy dwellings that they
              | would not otherwise be in a position to afford. Such properties are not
              | likely to be offered for sale, which limits the effective supply.
              | The third reason is that standards of construction were often
              | poor, resulting in problems with the quality of many existing dwellings.
              | According to the 2001 Census, one-third of Croatia’s housing stock is
              | older than 45 years (i.e., constructed up to 1960); 60% was constructed
              | between 1961 and 1990; and only 8% since 1991. From an investment
              | point of view, the amortisation period for buildings is usually 50 years,
              | so the bulk of the housing stock in Croatia is close to or past its useful
              | life. This also means that privatisation has saddled many occupiers with
              | liabilities in the form of high maintenance obligations.
              | Finally, as part of the economic transformation, the public sector
              | has largely pulled out of the housing construction business, while private
              | firms have not yet expanded sufficiently to bridge the gap in all segments
              | of the market. In particular, the financial problems of the public sector
              | have resulted in a sharp decline in the construction of social housing.
              | On the basis of these observations, one can form a working
              | hypothesis that the supply of housing is presently tight in both primary
              | and secondary markets. The question is, then, what is the likely impact
              | of growing demand for vacation homes by foreigners on the residential
              | property market? In particular, how realistic are fears, often expressed
              | in the public, that rising prices of summer vacation homes along the
              | Adriatic coast could spill over to the local housing market and negative-
              | ly affect the affordability of housing for ordinary Croatian households?
              | The potentially most important channel for the transmission of
              | price increases from the market for secondary residences to the residen-
              | tial housing market is the expectations channel. As with all assets, cur-
              | rent prices of real estate depend on expectations of future prices. The
              | housing market seems to be tight at the moment, so price increases in

meta          | 200
text          | the market for secondary residences are likely to be rapidly transmitted
              | to other segments of the market. Most relevant in this context is the
              | market situation on the Adriatic coast and islands, where most of the
              | property sales to foreigners are taking place. The number of permanent
              | dwellings on the coast and islands was 355,000 in 2001.xxiii In addition,
              | Croatians owned on the Adriatic about 118,000 vacation homes in
              | 2001, which represented two-thirds of the total number of such homes
              | in Croatia. Thus, vacation homes are already a key segment of the hous-
              | ing market on the Adriatic, accounting for a quarter of the total housing
              | stock in this region. Moreover, domestic and international media indi-
              | cate growing interest of foreigners in buying property on the Adriatic,
              | including for investment purposes.xxiv According to the news media,
              | prices of houses and land for construction have risen by 20-30% over
              | the past two years, and by 50-100% in most attractive locations such as
              | the old city of Dubrovnik.xxv
              | Given the relative size of this market segment and of reported
              | price increases, it is conceivable that rising prices of summer vacation
              | homes and of land for construction could, as postulated above, spill
              | over to the housing market for local residents and affect house prices
              | and affordability. Yet in the primary market there is no evidence to sub-
              | stantiate these concerns. The average prices of newly completed apart-
              | ments declined sharply after a run-up in 1999, and their growth
              | remained negative during 2000 and 2001 (Figure 2). In 2003, prices
              | increased only in Zagreb (by about 10%), while in the first half of 2004,
              | prices of newly completed apartments declined in all locations.

text          | Data on sales of existing homes and land for construction pro-
              | vide more support for the spillover hypothesis. Between March and
              | November 2004, house prices on the Adriatic increased at an annual
              | rate of 10%, and prices of land for construction at an annual rate of 30%
              | (Table 3). At the same time, house prices in Zagreb increased much
              | more rapidly, while apartment prices on the Adriatic actually fell, indi-
              | cating that property prices are also under strong influence of factors
              | other than non-resident demand for vacation properties. Nevertheless,
              | rising prices of houses and land for construction on the Adriatic reflect
              | at least in part expectations about the future demand of foreign buyers.
              | This is also confirmed by anecdotal evidence.xxvi More importantly, ris-
              | ing prices of land for construction can be interpreted as a leading indi-
              | cator of future increases in house prices on the Adriatic.
              | Given the lack of comprehensive statistical data on property
              | sales in the secondary market, the above results need to be interpreted
              | with caution. Data used to construct Table 3 come from a commercial
              | source, which publishes data at weekly frequency and with a relatively
              | detailed breakdown. However, these data do not cover all properties
              | offered for sale, and only indicate prices that are being asked by sellers
              | rather than actual transactions prices. Because real estate sales are sub-
              | ject to the value-added tax or the property sales tax, Croatian tax
              | authorities reportedly maintain a large data base on transactions in the
              | secondary market.xxvii However, these data are not published, nor have
              | they been made available to researchers.

text          | considerable delay (these data were used in Figure 2). The news media,
              | on the other hand, suffer from sample bias: they tend to focus on prop-
              | erties in exceptional locations, often bought by domestic and interna-
              | tional celebrities. The prices of such properties do not characterise gen-
              | eral trends in the housing market, but they nevertheless affect market
              | sentiment and sellers’ expectations, which is reflected in figures report-
              | ed in Table 3 and has also been reported by market participants. For
              | instance, many real estate agents consider prices of properties offered
              | for sale to be overvalued by about 30% on average.xxviii
              | Looking ahead, will the current conditions of relatively tight
              | housing supply and rising prices of at least some houses and land for
              | construction ease or become more pronounced with the opening-up of
              | the market to non-residents? And what role will the speed of liberalisa-
              | tion play in this process?
              | Arguments supporting the view that pressures on the local prop-
              | erty market might intensify fall into three categories. First, the number
              | of properties sold to foreigners has been small to date. As noted above,
              | since 1996 only about 3,200 property sales to foreigners have been
              | approved. Even if the true number of realised sales is twice as high (due
              | to provisions that allow foreigners to buy property via registered com-
              | panies), this would represent less than 2% of the stock of permanent
              | housing on the Adriatic (5% of the stock of summer vacation homes).
              | Such a small market segment clearly cannot influence the overall real
              | estate market. In the future, however, foreign demand for secondary
              | residences is likely to be much higher, and might therefore have a more
              | significant impact on developments in the housing market. As of
              | September 2004, real estate brokers estimated the number of potential
              | sales already in the pipeline at about 10,000 houses.xxix This is equiva-
              | lent to 75% of the average annual supply of new housing in the entire
              | country. A demand shock of this size would clearly have a big impact
              | on the local housing market, even if the sales were realised over a peri-
              | od of 2-3 years.
              | The second concern relates to construction costs. If the construc-
              | tion industry is operating at full capacity, increased demand for vaca-
              | tion homes by non-residents will put pressure on housing construction
              | costs in the short run, which will spill over to the market for permanent
              | housing. To the extent that the construction industry is not competitive,
              | the increase in costs – and hence the spillover on the local housing mar-
              | ket – will be so much the higher. One should note that in the long run
              | housing supply is elastic with respect to both income and price, so
              | mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 203
meta          | 203
text          | capacity in the construction industry is not likely to be a factor con-
              | straining the supply of housing. But cost spillovers may be present in
              | the short run and affect expectations of future prices, in particular if
              | there is a sudden increase in demand.
              | The third concern is that for an average family the affordability
              | of housing is already low, so that any spillover of price increases and
              | construction costs due to the opening-up of the property market to for-
              | eigners might make housing even less affordable for the local popula-
              | tion. However, concerns about affordability relate primarily to access to
              | housing finance and public housing policy, and have little to do with
              | non-residents’ demand for vacation properties (see Box 2).
              | The main argument supporting the view that demand from non-
              | residents will not affect future supply and price of local housing is that
              | legal uncertainties relating to property transactions will be gradually
              | removed as Croatia approaches membership in the EU and starts imple-
              | menting the acquis communitaire. As noted above, many properties
              | desired by foreign as well as domestic buyers do not have clean titles,
              | so many potential trades have not been realised. In such circumstances
              | it is not surprising that properties with clean title fetch higher prices.
              | More importantly, legal uncertainty is presently constraining the poten-
              | tial supply of permanent housing in the secondary market. Clean prop-
              | erty titles and orderly and more efficient cadastres will most likely
              | bring many houses, apartments and pieces of land that are currently
              | withheld from it onto the market, including some of the 200,000 tem-
              | porarily unoccupied dwellings mentioned above.
              | The speed with which the property market is opened up to non-

              | Keeping restrictions on foreign ownership in place might sustain rela-
              | tively high prices by limiting the supply of vacation properties to non-
              | residents. However, the prices of such properties and real estate in gen-
              | eral are bound to increase anyway with rising incomes in the long
              | run.xxx The issue is then, how fast will prices of vacation properties con-
              | verge to their long-term equilibrium? Given the apparent interest of for-
              | eigners in the Croatian property market, it is likely that a rapid removal
              | of restrictions would lead to a large increase in demand for secondary
              | residences, while at the same time the supply response would be less
              | elastic due to legal constraints and limited capacity in construction
              | industry. This would, ceteris paribus, imply faster convergence to long-
              | run equilibrium prices, but with potentially significant spillovers onto
              | the local housing market along the way. On the other hand, a more

              | respond to foreign demand, thereby limiting price increases in the short
              | run and lowering costs of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium.
              | Box 2 Affordability of housing, housing finance and public
              | housing
              | Contrary to widespread beliefs, the affordability of housing
              | has not declined in recent years. Except in 1999, net earnings were
              | growing faster than average prices of new housing (Figure 3).
              | However, the index of housing affordability is very low in Croatia:
              | an average annual income in 2003 was equivalent to the average
              | price of just 5.5 m2 of a newly completed apartment. In other words,
              | one family member would need to put aside his or her entire annu-
              | al income for ten years in order to save enough for a modest 55m2
              | apartment, assuming that average income and apartment prices
              | grow at the same rate. Affordability of housing is therefore a legit-
              | imate concern. However, one should not jump to the conclusion that
              | housing would become more affordable if foreign ownership of real
              | estate was more restricted. Housing affordability depends on many
              | factors that have no connection to demand for vacation homes by
              | non-residents. Two factors that are examined here are housing
              | finance and public housing policy.

              | compared with mature market economies and some new member
              | states.xxxi Moreover, housing loans in Croatia are still relatively
              | expensive: they are mostly short-term products with a maturity of
              | less than ten years (although longer-term loans are now being pro-
              | vided by some banks); the loan-to-value ratio is typically lower than
              | the standard in advanced market economies; interest rates remain
              | generally high both in nominal and real terms (although they have
              | declined in recent years); loans provided with a fixed interest rate
              | are still rare; and most loans are provided with a foreign exchange
              | clause so that households bear the currency risk. Banks justified
              | these practices in the past by the difficulty of enforcing foreclosure
              | of residential properties. However, reforms in legislation and the
              | judiciary over the past few years have made it easier for creditors to
              | seize properties or attach salaries used as collateral for housing
              | loans.xxxii The fact that the restrictive practices in granting housing
              | loans survive indicates that the housing loan market in Croatia is
              | still relatively underdeveloped, and access to housing finance diffi-
              | cult for an average family.
              | The relatively high indebtedness of Croatian households
              | represents a further constraint on housing affordability. In 2003 net
              | earnings of Croatian households amounted to about 65 billion kuna,
              | while outstanding bank loans to households amounted to 55 billion
              | kuna.xxxiii This corresponds to a debt to income ratio of about 84%,
              | which is higher than in the euro area (about 80%). On this basis,
              | there would not seem to be much room for expanding household
              | indebtedness, although there is considerable room for changing the
              | structure of household debt toward more housing loans and fewer
              | consumer loans.
              | What are the other options for improving housing affordabil-
              | ity? Contractual savings and subsidised housing schemes are still rel-
              | atively unimportant in Croatia. In the six years since the first housing
              | savings banks were established, they made only 9,350 housing loans
              | to a total value of 60 million euros, compared with accumulated
              | deposits of around 470 million euros in mid-2004.xxxiv Judging from
              | the experience of the new EU member states, the success of such
              | housing schemes can be attributed largely to state-provided incen-
              | tives. This, however, creates a considerable fiscal burden for the state.
              | In 2003, the government of Hungary was forced to remove most fis-
              | cal incentives for housing, as their cost significantly contributed to
              | the general government deficit of 9.3% of GDP in the previous year.

text          | Given the pressing need for fiscal consolidation in Croatia, expand-
              | ing subsidies to contractual housing schemes does not seem feasible.
              | Another approach to addressing housing affordability is via
              | public housing policy. Even in countries with highly sophisticated
              | financial systems some segments of the population (including the
              | poor, people who are unable to work, and young couples) do not
              | have access to housing finance. In Croatia there have been only two
              | larger public housing schemes in recent years: one targeting handi-
              | capped veterans of the Homeland War; and the so-called POS
              | scheme of public subsidies for housing construction. Under the for-
              | mer scheme, a total of 4,400 apartments have been constructed since
              | 1997, with plans for a further 700 units. Under the latter scheme,
              | 1,500 apartments have been constructed since 2000 and 8,000 more
              | are being planned.xxxv The POS scheme has been criticised, howev-
              | er, for poor targeting (see Tica, 2002). In particular, many poorer
              | households are not in a position to qualify for the scheme due to rel-
              | atively high down payments (over 100% of average annual income
              | for an apartment of 50m2) and debt servicing costs (about 30% of
              | average income).xxxvi Taxpayers’ money may thus have been used to
              | assist the relatively better-off households, rather than the economi-
              | cally disadvantaged ones, to acquire low-cost housing.
              | A broader implication of this situation, rarely articulated in
              | public discussions, is that the current younger generation finds it
              | much more difficult to acquire own housing than the older genera-
              | tions. Under the socialist system, housing was for the most part pro-
              | vided by the public sector or labour-managed enterprises. Even
              | after this practice was abandoned in the 1980s and families had to
              | turn to the banks for housing loans, conditions for obtaining loans
              | were comparatively benign. The state-owned banks extended hous-
              | ing loans with very long maturities, no required collateral or rela-
              | tively small down payments, and at very favourable fixed interest
              | rates, which significantly reduced the burden of debt service in an
              | environment of high inflation.xxxvii This system was, of course,
              | unsustainable especially once the government stopped bailing out
              | the state-owned commercial banks. Since then, with the exception
              | of public sector housing schemes mentioned above, housing loans
              | have been provided at essentially market terms.xxxviii
              | In summary, there is some evidence that increased demand for
              | secondary homes by non-residents may have already led to an increase
              | in house and land prices on the Adriatic. The future effect will depend

              | constraints and competition in the construction industry; the speed with
              | which legal impediments to property sales are removed; and develop-
              | ments in household incomes, housing finance and other factors influ-
              | encing the affordability of housing. In general, however, given the sup-
              | ply rigidities, one could expect that a measured approach to the open-
              | ing of the real estate market to non-residents would allow for a more
              | orderly adjustment than a rapid removal of restrictions.
              | IMPACT OF EUROPEAN UNION ACCESSION
              | ON CROATIA’S TOURISM INDUSTRY
              | The preceding sections identified the right of EU nationals to
              | acquire property in Croatia as an important issue in forthcoming accession
              | negotiations, and discussed potential implications of foreign investment in
              | real estate for the local housing market. This section considers how devel-
              | opments on this front might influence Croatia’s tourism industry.
              | As with the real estate market, the lack of rigorous economic
              | analysis and adequate statistical data on tourism make it difficult to
              | assess even the size and economic potential of this industry, let alone
              | its dynamics in the context of Croatia’s accession to the EU. One of the
              | few analytical studies available is a report by the World Travel and
              | Tourism Council (2004), which uses the methodology of tourism satel-
              | lite accounts (TSA), developed by the OECD and the World Tourism
              | Organization in the 1990s.xxxix This methodology aims at identifying
              | more precisely different industries supplying the tourism output, and
              | thus offers policy makers better insights into economic and other
              | effects of tourism (see Annex).
              | The TSA methodology clearly indicates that travel and tourism
              | is a key economic activity in Croatia: its contribution to GDP in 2003
              | is estimated at 28% ($8 billion), and to total employment at 21%
              | (294,000 jobs) (Table 4).xl The bulk of this contribution ($4.6 billion,
              | equivalent to 16% of GDP) comes from spending by international vis-
              | itors on goods and services (so-called visitor exports). In terms of
              | national accounts, travel and tourism contribute 44% of total exports,
              | absorb 19% of total imports; and account for 11% of personal con-
              | sumption and 11% of capital investment.
              | In international comparison, Croatia ranks 22nd among more
              | than 160 countries in terms of the share of travel and tourism in GDP

              | states from central Europe); 16th in terms of the share of travel and
              | tourism in total employment (behind Turkey, but well ahead of the
              | countries mentioned above); and 13th in terms of the share of travel and
              | tourism exports in total exports. However, in terms of government
              | expenditure on tourism, Croatia lags far behind: national and local gov-
              | ernment agencies in Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary,
              | Italy and Switzerland spend between 3,5% and 7,5% of their total
              | expenditure on tourism-related services, compared with just 1% in
              | Croatia. This seems far too low, because local government initiatives
              | (for instance, promotion of agro-tourism in Istria) can broaden the spec-
              | trum of services offered, increase tourist expenditure and perhaps
              | extend the tourist season. The report sees strong growth prospects for
              | Croatia’s travel and tourism industry, which is projected to expand by
              | nearly 7% per annum over the next ten years, much faster than either
              | EU or world-wide demand for tourism.

text          | The question that arises against this background is to what
              | extent the expected increase in investment in Croatian real estate by
              | residents of the EU might change the outlook for and the character of
              | travel and tourism industry over the medium term. One issue that seems
              | particularly relevant in this context is whether accession to the EU
              | offers the opportunity for tourism to assume a leading role in overall
              | economic development, or represents the threat to what is widely con-
              | sidered to be the last remaining environmentally unspoiled area of the
              | Mediterranean within easy reach of major European cities. To address
              | these issues, it is necessary first to consider the main features of tourism
              | in Croatia. As it turns out, Croatian tourism is in many respects very
              | similar to tourism in other southern European countries, so useful les-
              | sons can be learned by referring to the experience of these countries.
              | The first point to note is that tourism in Croatia, as in other
              | southern European countries, is dominated by international mass
              | tourism. The main object of mass tourism is the beach holiday, with its
              | natural (coastal environment, climate) and man-made ingredients
              | (restaurants, hotels, etc) marketed as “sunshine and sea” packages pro-
              | viding an escape from the routines of domestic and work life. This
              | social image of tourism and the lack of product differentiation imply a

              | develop “elite” tourism focusing on high-income visitors or “sustain-
              | able” tourism aimed at keeping tourism resources available for future
              | generations are not likely to succeed in replacing incomes generated by
              | the mass tourism industry, which brings 8-9 million tourists to Croatia
              | or 50 million tourists to Spain each year.xlii The Common Agricultural
              | Policy of the EU, with its emphasis on farmers as keepers of the envi-
              | ronment and on diversification of tourist destinations, has provided a
              | boost to rural tourism in the EU, but while important in rural areas, the
              | net effect on the tourist industry has been minimal (Williams, 2001).
              | The second characteristic of mass tourism is its extreme vulner-
              | ability to developments over which the industry itself has little control.
              | One example is tourism’s high elasticity in relation to incomes.xliii
              | Given that tourist activity does not, in the main, meet a vital need,
              | tourist behaviour is highly volatile and subject to psychological and
              | social influences, personal sensitivities, fashion, and short term reac-
              | tions. If the image of just one link in the chain is affected, then the
              | whole tourism industry suffers consequences. The most obvious mani-
              | festation of this sensitivity is the impact of political uncertainty or the

              | Croatia’s experience during the 1990s is a clear case in point. However,
              | the issue is present worldwide, especially since the terrorist attacks of
              | 11 September 2001.xliv
              | The tourism practiced in Croatia and other southern European
              | countries is also characterised by a potentially high level of systemic
              | risk on the supply side. Threshold levels of capital and skills required
              | for starting a tourism business – for instance, the letting of rooms – are
              | relatively low. This means that there is a high elasticity of supply.
              | While this has provided an important opportunity for social and eco-
              | nomic mobility for lower income households, most of which used to
              | be engaged in agriculture, the ease of entry into the tourism market
              | may threaten the longer-term competitiveness of established tourist
              | areas as new resorts develop. Moreover, it may threaten the competi-
              | tiveness of existing resorts through overdevelopment and devastation
              | of the landscape. This problem has been particularly pronounced in
              | Croatia, where weaknesses of spatial planning and local administra-
              | tion, misplaced government incentives, and failure to control clandes-
              | tine (“wild”) construction have forced the authorities to take drastic
              | measures to prevent overbuilding and protect the public coastal
              | domain (see Box 3).
              | Box 3 Clandestine construction and protection of the public
              | coastal domain
              | Clandestine construction has been a longstanding issue in
              | southern European countries (see Mullins, 1991) and has recently
              | become a major issue in Croatia. The phenomenon has diverse ori-
              | gins but a common outcome – devastation of the coastal environ-
              | ment, which is a key ingredient of the main tourism product of these
              | countries, and hence a serious threat to their competitiveness.
              | The proximate causes of clandestine construction are defi-
              | ciencies of spatial planning and local administration, and the failure
              | of the authorities to enforce building regulations.xlv But the ultimate
              | cause is more likely to be the lack of clearly defined property rights.
              | This problem was highlighted by de Soto (2000) in his seminal
              | study on establishing capitalism in developing countries. To illus-
              | trate the problem, de Soto tried to open a small garment factory in
              | Peru. He discovered that to obtain a license to operate such a small
              | business took 289 days and cost 31 times the average yearly mini-
              | mum wage.xlvi Not surprisingly, most people bypassed the process,
              | operating without a license. De Soto concluded that developing and

text          | former socialist countries' principal problem in fostering private
              | sector development was how to provide easy access to legal mech-
              | anisms such as property titles for land, houses and other assets that
              | indigenous entrepreneurs own de facto but not de jure. Without
              | property titles, people have no transferable rights of ownership with
              | which to establish and operate their businesses.
              | In the case of Croatia, these problems have manifested
              | themselves in long delays in obtaining clean property titles and
              | building permits. For instance, Croatian courts have accumulated
              | some 400,000 unresolved cases of property claims.xlvii There have
              | also been many clear violations of regulations on spatial planning
              | and construction, which captured domestic news headlines and
              | prompted the authorities to take determined measures, including the
              | demolition of illegally constructed dwellings.xlviii But misplaced
              | incentives are also partly to blame. Until recently, the government
              | subsidised loans for start-up businesses in tourism with the aim for
              | promoting self-employment. However, most loans were used for
              | construction of tourist apartments, often without building
              | permits.xlix
              | To prevent further infringement of the coastline, the govern-
              | ment passed in September 2004 Regulation on the protection of the
              | coastal public domain (Government of Croatia, 2004). This regula-
              | tion is similar to Spain’s Ley de las Costas, passed in 1988 in
              | response to environmental backlash against the overdevelopment of
              | the coastlines, including by foreigners who acquired a large number
              | of secondary residences.l The regulation protects all islands, the sea
              | within 300 meters of the coastline, and coastal areas within 1 kilo-
              | metre. It prohibits the construction of new houses and tourist apart-
              | ments within 70 meters of the coastline. Except for infrastructure
              | facilities, new construction within 100 meters of the coastline will
              | be allowed only in the case of hotels and restaurants in specially
              | designated areas. The regulation also restricts other construction in
              | settlements where the majority of the population is local as well as
              | in tourist resorts.
              | While this regulation may help solve some of the most acute
              | problems of construction in coastal areas, Croatia will continue to
              | face problems of the protection of the public coastal domain on a
              | permanent basis, given that tourism results in extreme pressures on
              | the local economy and environment at a few points in time and
              | space. In particular, 95% of hotel and restaurant accommodation
              | capacity in Croatia is located on the Adriatic Coast and islands, and
              | over 60% of overnight stays are recorded in July and August.

text          | A further notable development has been a pronounced tendency
              | towards self-provisioning. It has been most visible in the accommoda-
              | tion sector and has started with the growth of second home ownership
              | of local residents. The growth of “weekend homes” in Croatia and
              | other southern European countries is also a broader economic and
              | social phenomenon. In the former Yugoslavia it was partly a conse-
              | quence of scarcity of other goods and services on the market on which
              | to spend income on the one hand, and the basically free provision of
              | services such as housing, education and health care on the other. At the
              | same time, the widespread distribution of second homes across social
              | classes and geographical locations reflects the persistence of rural-
              | urban ties, with first generation urban dwellers inheriting homes in the
              | countryside. Moreover, owning a weekend home in a coastal resort is a
              | widely held aspiration and status symbol in all social classes, a part of
              | the mythology of what constitutes social progress (Williams, 2001).
              | With enlargement of the EU to Portugal and Spain and the
              | removal of restrictions on the movement of capital in the Union in the
              | 1990s, there has also been a marked increase in second home owner-
              | ship of foreign residents. For instance, in Spain there are an estimated
              | 2 million second homes, one million of which are owned by foreigners
              | (ibid., 2001). However, if the experience of other southern European
              | countries can be a guide, one should not expect a significant increase in
              | direct foreign ownership of tourist facilities other than second homes.li
              | The reason is that foreign companies are mainly interested in facilities
              | they can differentiate through branding and location, such as hotels
              | aimed at business travellers or exclusive resorts. On the other hand, the
              | tourism product being sold by Croatia (sun, sea, etc.) is largely indiffer-
              | ent to branding and location, so the emphasis is almost entirely on the
              | value for money of the total holiday package. This situation is not like-
              | ly to change with the growth of foreign ownership of vacation homes.
              | What are the major potential costs and benefits of increased for-
              | eign ownership of summer vacation homes for Croatian tourism? As
              | noted above, the main potential cost is that of overdevelopment. Since
              | this can result in the devastation of the coastal environment, which is
              | one of the key attractions for tourists visiting Croatia, it would result in
              | a loss of competitiveness for the tourism industry. One should also
              | emphasise that there are many tourist attractions other than real estate
              | on the Adriatic (see Kušen, 2002) that are not adequately protected and
              | will need to be considered in the context of the opening-up of the real
              | estate market to non-residents. The recent strengthening of building

meta          | 213
text          | regulations in coastal areas and the reasoned expectation that EU resi-
              | dents will respect these and other regulations (unlike many domestic
              | developers in the past), provide some assurance that Croatia, unlike
              | many coastal areas of Spain for instance, will avoid the overbuilding
              | scenario. However, the authorities, in particular at the local level,
              | should avoid complacency on this crucial issue, as weaknesses in the
              | enforcement of building regulations have a long history in Croatia. The
              | speed with which the real estate market is opened up to foreigners could
              | make a difference here as well – a sudden increase in demand for vaca-
              | tion homes could increase incentives for local governments and devel-
              | opers to bypass the recently introduced building regulations and cash in
              | on the interest of foreign buyers as quickly as possible.
              | Other potential costs for tourism are few and largely unrelated to
              | foreign ownership of vacation homes. Croatia’s tourism will in all like-
              | lihood continue to face the same challenges that it grapples with today:
              | how to encourage greater market and product diversification; invest
              | more in effective marketing and promotion; develop the human capital
              | and technologies required for growth; create a more stable and pre-
              | dictable regulatory environment; match public and private infrastructure
              | to customer demand; and promote responsibility in natural, social and
              | cultural environments. It is unlikely that widespread foreign ownership
              | of secondary residences will add to this long list of problems, the solu-
              | tions for which are by and large well known but are difficult to imple-
              | ment because of the lack of co-ordination among different public and
              | private sector bodies and weaknesses in local administration.
              | On the other hand, increased foreign ownership of secondary
              | residences could have a number of potentially significant benefits for
              | tourism and local communities. With the revival of interest by foreign
              | buyers, houses and land that until recently had little or no economic
              | value have practically overnight become a potentially important source
              | of wealth for indigenous owners and local communities. In addition,
              | much of the existing housing stock could be renewed by foreigners
              | interested in owning old stone houses build in the authentic architectur-
              | al style of this part of the Mediterranean. This would increase attrac-
              | tiveness of the Adriatic Coast and islands for other tourists as well.
              | Foreign investment in real estate could also revive local commu-
              | nities on the Adriatic. Demographic trends in many coastal communi-
              | ties and on most islands have been unfavourable ever since the late 19th
              | century, and these trends seem to have accelerated over the past decade
              | (see Wertheimer-Baletiæ, 2003). This has resulted in lack of investment
              | mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 214
meta          | 214
text          | in housing, infrastructure and public services, with possibly tens of
              | thousands of old houses falling into disrepair and many villages being
              | abandoned. A trend observed in other southern European countries is
              | that many second homes eventually become the principal homes of
              | expatriate settlers, thereby generating year-round income streams and
              | permanent jobs in local communities. These jobs might in turn lead to
              | the establishment of many new households on the Adriatic, which
              | could over time perhaps reverse negative demographic trends. The
              | clearest examples of this course of development worldwide are the US
              | states of Arizona and Florida, where many previously dormant commu-
              | nities have been transformed into vibrant centres of development after
              | erstwhile tourists from northern states established their permanent res-
              | idence in the south.
              | Local authorities and indigenous entrepreneurs would thus be
              | well advised to use the current period of strong interest in Croatia as a
              | tourist destination to plan for the future. Sooner or later, the demand
              | and the supply are likely to shift – tourism, like any industry, cannot
              | avoid changes in consumer preferences and the product life cycle. Or to
              | put it differently, tourism is neither “a passport to development” nor a
              | “unique devil” (de Kadt, 1979); its role in economic development
              | depends on the form of tourism and on the structure of the national and
              | regional economies within which it is inserted.
              | MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS
              | What are the likely effects of increased foreign investment in
              | secondary residences on the national economy?
              | One important macroeconomic effect – the wealth effect – has
              | already been in evidence for some time. As noted above, the value of
              | real estate and land in areas that are attracting potential buyers has
              | increased even ahead of any large-scale property sales to foreigners.
              | This clearly demonstrates the powerful impact that economic expecta-
              | tions exert on current asset valuations. It also implies that any tighten-
              | ing of restrictions on property sales to foreigners would result in wealth
              | losses. In an extreme case, prohibiting the sales of real estate to foreign-
              | ers would wipe out billions of euros of potential wealth of Croatian cit-
              | izens and a proportionate amount of tax revenues.
              | Another key macroeconomic effect relates to the potentially
              | large capital inflows associated with non-residents’ payments for prop-
              | mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 215
meta          | 215
text          | erties purchased in Croatia. Considering only the estimate of house pur-
              | chases that are currently being arranged – the sales of 10,000 houses
              | mentioned above – and assuming a very conservative average price of
              | 50,000 euros per house, capital inflows already in the pipeline would
              | amount to about 500 million euros, or nearly 2% of GDP. To put this
              | number in perspective, it is equivalent to the average annual net issuance
              | of international bonds by the Croatian government during 1995-2003, or
              | to 50% of the average annual inflows of foreign direct investment. An
              | overly rapid liberalisation of the real estate market could thus unleash
              | potentially significant appreciation pressures on the kuna, which could
              | have important effects on the external competitiveness of the economy
              | as a whole and export industries, including tourism.
              | The wealth effect and the associated capital inflows will be ini-
              | tially distributed among property and land owners on the one side, and
              | the construction and real estate development industries on the other.
              | Depending on how the income thus generated is spent and invested, one
              | can envisage a number of different macroeconomic scenarios. One pos-
              | sibility is that property and land owners will use the bulk of the pro-
              | ceeds of real estate sales to finance personal consumption, while the
              | construction and real estate development industries will use additional
              | revenue largely to raise wages and dividend payments. This would
              | result in rapid growth of personal consumption and imports, inflation-
              | ary pressures, deterioration of the external current account, and eventu-
              | ally loss of competitiveness. Another possibility is that the capital gen-
              | erated by the real estate sales is reinvested in local housing, tourism
              | enterprises, or other sectors of the economy. This would lead to demand
              | pressures and additional imports as well, but in contrast to the former
              | scenario the productive capacity of the economy would increase, help-
              | ing to maintain longer-term competitiveness. Finally, the proceeds of
              | property sales could be reinvested abroad, so the net effect of the inflow
              | could be more or less offset by capital outflows.
              | There would in addition be a series of second round effects
              | stemming from the consumption and investment patterns of foreign
              | owners of secondary residences. If the residences are rented out to for-
              | eign holiday makers who would otherwise purchase accommodation
              | from domestic owners of hotels or apartments, the income stream from
              | tourism might be reduced. However, if secondary residences become
              | the principal homes of foreign buyers, as has been suggested above,
              | they may generate permanent income streams for local communities
              | and the domestic economy.

text          | The effects of property sales to foreigners on fiscal revenues are
              | likely to be positive. The sales as well as any increase in personal con-
              | sumption resulting from the sales will generate additional VAT rev-
              | enue. Likewise, additional personal and corporate incomes generated
              | by investing the proceeds of sales will at least partly be subject to
              | income taxes. The overall fiscal effect will then depend on how addi-
              | tional revenue is spent by the local communities and the central govern-
              | ment. Here one could consider the same scenarios as with personal con-
              | sumption and investment: if additional fiscal revenues are spent on cur-
              | rent public consumption, domestic demand pressures (and possibly
              | imports) will increase; if they are invested in education, debt repay-
              | ment, infrastructure, improvements in the functioning of public servic-
              | es and institutions etc, demand pressures may increase, but the compet-
              | itive position of the economy will improve in the long run.
              | All of these effects have yet to be researched, so at present it is
              | not possible to assess with any degree of certainty the likely macroeco-
              | nomic effects of foreign investment in Croatia’s property.
              | Nevertheless, given the size of potential wealth effects and capital
              | inflows, there are solid economic arguments in favour of a gradual
              | rather than a swift liberalisation of the property market.
              | CONCLUSION AND POLICY
              | RECOMMENDATIONS
              | The main conclusion from the preceding analysis is that Croatia
              | stands to benefit in the long term from foreign investment in the prop-
              | erty sector, but in the medium term a measured approach to the open-
              | ing-up of the market can be justified on a number of grounds. These
              | include spillovers of price increases from the market for secondary res-
              | idences onto the local housing market (of which there is already some
              | evidence); costs of adjustment in the housing market and construction
              | industry to a sudden large increase in demand for secondary residences;
              | loss of competitiveness in the tourism industry in the case of violations
              | of building regulations and the resulting overdevelopment of coastal
              | areas (the incentives for which would increase if the property market is
              | opened up suddenly); and macroeconomic pressures arising from large
              | and sudden capital inflows.
              | Another general conclusion is that much additional research
              | needs to be done on the economics of the real estate market, tourism

text          | and on the macroeconomic effects of developments in the property
              | market. In particular, major efforts at improving statistical information
              | on the real estate market and tourism are necessary. For instance, with-
              | out comprehensive information on transactions in the market for exist-
              | ing homes or in the housing construction industry, it is not possible to
              | assess the overall state of the housing market, nor can one develop use-
              | ful scenarios for the diverse macroeconomic effects of foreign invest-
              | ment in the property sector. In addition, the analysis has identified a
              | number of weaknesses in the current legislative framework, from regu-
              | lations on property sales to foreigners, to inadequate legislation protect-
              | ing against property speculation, to the well-known problems with
              | property titles, cadastres, and enforcement of building and spatial plan-
              | ning regulations.
              | Against this background, what approach could Croatia follow in
              | negotiations on the free movement of capital with the EU? The difficul-
              | ty of negotiations on this point can be better understood when put in the
              | proper perspective of the way that negotiations are conducted. By join-
              | ing the EU, a country accepts to adopt and apply the rules of the club.
              | Exceptionally, the EU agrees that certain rules can be adopted over a
              | longer time horizon after membership, provided that exceptions are
              | limited in scope and in time. Exceptions are therefore temporary in
              | nature and granted to allow a country sufficient time to adapt. In the
              | case of Croatia, a transitional period for investment in real estate last-
              | ing four years from the entry into force of the SAA has already been
              | agreed. However, Croatian authorities could decide to extend this peri-
              | od once negotiations on EU membership begin. But since other
              | requests for transitional periods will undoubtedly be made in the nego-
              | tiation process, the authorities will need to set up priorities among dif-
              | ferent areas, deciding whether, for instance, it is more important to
              | request a longer transitional period for the real estate sector or for
              | adjustment in agriculture.
              | Yet, if transitional periods are exceptional, it is evident that per-
              | manent arrangements – also known as derogations – are practically
              | ruled out. The reason is that by their very nature derogations go against
              | the principle that the law is equal for all (Busuttil, 2002). Derogations
              | also go against the spirit of acting in common, because they allow a
              | country to operate outside the scope of the law binding all the rest. If
              | derogations applied in all cases, there would be no common action and
              | there would be little scope for having the EU at all. No country can
              | expect to benefit from the rights of membership if, at the same time, it
              | does not want to shoulder the obligations.

text          | Although Section 2 highlighted some examples in EU law
              | where derogations have been granted to individual countries to allow
              | them to operate differently from the rest – for instance, the cases of
              | Malta and Denmark in respect of restrictions on foreign ownership of
              | secondary residences, and Poland in respect of agricultural land pur-
              | chases by non-residents – it is not likely that Croatia will be able to
              | wring any meaningful concessions out of the EU. The reason is that it
              | would be very hard to prove that Croatia has a paramount reason for not
              | allowing EU residents to buy property beyond one secondary residence.
              | Inadequate legislation against property speculation is a weak excuse –
              | adopting such legislation is in the interests of the country already, as
              | domestic residents could engage in such activities. Likewise, it is not in
              | the long-run economic interest of Croatian citizens and the authorities
              | to further restrict foreign ownership of real estate, as this would wipe
              | out considerable amounts of potential wealth and fiscal revenue. A well
              | articulated public discussion could nevertheless help in formulating
              | arguments to support Croatia’s case on this and other important issues,
              | and in deciding on the priority areas that need adjustment and hence
              | longer transitional periods.
              | Turning to the real estate market, Section 3 identified two chan-
              | nels through which the opening of Croatia’s real estate market to EU
              | residents could affect housing prices and affordability: expectations of
              | future price increases, and housing supply rigidities in the event a rapid
              | liberalisation leads to a sudden increase in demand for property by for-
              | eign investors. Recommendations in this area are therefore more
              | straightforward. First, the authorities need to stabilise the expectations
              | that a housing boom on the Adriatic is imminent. Particularly helpful in
              | this respect would be a more transparent and efficient application of
              | existing regulations on sales of real estate to foreigners, and the contin-
              | ued determined implementation of the latest regulation on housing con-
              | struction and protection of the coastal public domain.
              | Second, much can be done to improve the legislative framework
              | and administrative procedures for property transactions. Legal uncer-
              | tainty is probably a major constraint on the potential supply of perma-
              | nent housing in the secondary market at present. Clean property titles
              | and orderly and more efficient cadastres would bring to the market
              | many houses, apartments and pieces of land that are currently withheld
              | from the market.
              | Third, one aspect of housing finance that is visible in most
              | industrial countries and many new EU members but is absent in Croatia

text          | is involvement of the state in the mortgage market. Hungary and
              | Poland, for instance, introduced legislation on mortgage bonds and
              | mortgage banks following the German approach, while in Bulgaria, the
              | Czech Republic, Latvia, and Slovakia commercial banks can obtain a
              | mortgage banking license and issue mortgage bonds, which provide
              | banks with an alternative tool to raise funds earmarked for housing
              | loans. In addition, in most European countries the state has been pro-
              | viding a limited amount of housing loans directly, by establishing pub-
              | lic funds to promote housing construction and finance. While Croatia
              | has developed two such schemes, it is not clear that one of them (the
              | POS scheme) is well targeted.
              | In Section 4 it was argued that the character of Croatia’s tourism
              | is not likely to change significantly with the growth of foreign owner-
              | ship of vacation homes. While some additional pressures on the envi-
              | ronment and local economies can be expected, they would not differ
              | qualitatively from the pressures that tourist resorts are already experi-
              | encing with the robust growth of tourism in recent years. As for the
              | broader implications of EU accession on Croatia’s tourism industry,
              | these can be largely separated from the issue of increased foreign own-
              | ership of vacation homes. Thus far there has been little EU intervention
              | in the field of tourism. Freedom of movement provisions, competition
              | law and other EU regulations have barely touched the tourism industry
              | (Williams, 2001). Most tourism regions in Croatia will have to face
              | choices about diversifying their source and product markets, imposing
              | stricter development controls and improving the quality of their tourism
              | product irrespective of accession to the EU. Given the ease of entry into
              | tourism, which is domina ted by fragmented indigenous capital, they
              | will also face greater competition from other southern European desti-
              | nations and the challenge of constantly adapting to new forms of
              | demand. Some resorts may decline as a result unless they are reinvigo-
              | rated by new investment and innovation. In this area, foreign invest-
              | ment in real estate could play a very useful role.
              | Regarding the macroeconomic effects of foreign investment in the
              | property sector, no one knows exactly how many foreigners may eventu-
              | ally end up buying property in Croatia. Perhaps the share of secondary
              | residences owned by foreigners will never be as high as for instance the
              | 50% share in Spain. In the case of Croatia, this would imply purchases of
              | some 100,000 vacation homes by foreigners, resulting in potential
              | inflows of 5 billion euros, or 20% of GDP. But as argued in Section 5,
              | even if foreigners purchase only a few thousand vacation homes, the

              | effects on the local and national economies would be sufficiently high to
              | warrant caution on the part of macroeconomic policy makers.
              | Measuring the economic impact of tourism:
              | Tourism Satellite Account
              | Tourism plays a significant role in many economies in terms of
              | the production of goods and services and the creation of employment
              | opportunities. However, tourism remains difficult to define and meas-
              | ure, and as a result the industry suffers from a credibility problem. In
              | the case of conventional industries such as agriculture or manufactur-
              | ing, the contribution of industry to GDP is measured from the supply
              | side, i.e., from the value of goods and services they produce. In the case
              | of tourism, this conventional approach covers mainly the output provid-
              | ed by the hotel and restaurant industry, which is equivalent to only
              | about 3% of GDP in Croatia. Yet the contribution of tourism to GDP
              | goes far beyond this narrow definition, to other industries supplying
              | tourism output such as agriculture, fishing, the food industry, construc-
              | tion, transportation, cultural establishments, etc.
              | In the past, economists relied on estimates of income multipliers
              | to approximate indirect effects of tourism on domestic industries other
              | than hotels and restaurants.lii This methodology, however, is unreliable
              | as it is based on many ad hoc assumptions. In contrast, TSA recast the
              | national accounts so as to identify the diverse products and services that
              | are delivered to domestic and foreign visitors. On the demand side,
              | TSA include two basic aggregates:
              | • Travel and tourism consumption, which includes four components: (i)
              | the value of products and services consumed by domestic and interna-
              | tional visitors for personal travel and tourism; (ii) business travel by
              | government and industry; (iii) expenditure by individual government
              | agencies and departments that specialise in visitor services (cultural
              | and recreational establishments, immigration and customs, etc) and
              | (iv) spending by international visitors on goods and services (so-
              | called visitor exports).
              | • Travel and tourism demand, which estimates a broader, economy-
              | wide impact of tourism and includes three components: (i) public
              | mihaljek.qxd

text          | spending on tourism promotion, aviation administration, security and
              | similar services made on behalf of the community at large but close-
              | ly associated with tourism (so-called collective government expendi-
              | ture); (ii) capital investments to provide facilities, equipment and
              | infrastructure to visitors and (iii) goods and capital sent abroad for
              | ultimate sale to visitors or use by providers of travel and tourism serv-
              | ices (so-called non-visitor exports).
              | On the supply side, TSA also produce two different aggregates:
              | the travel and tourism industry and the travel and tourism economy.
              | The former captures only the direct impact of travel and tourism for
              | comparison with conventional industries such as manufacturing. The
              | latter captures the broader, indirect, or economy-wide impact of travel
              | and tourism. The TSA show separately the portion of travel and tourism
              | supply that is imported (including expenditure on outbound travel by
              | domestic residents), and also calculate direct and indirect components
              | of value added produced by travel and tourism industry. Finally, the
              | TSA show employment for travel and tourism industry and travel and
              | tourism economy.

              | The lengthy approval procedure is perhaps more a reflection of red tape in various
              | ministries and local governments involved (on this, see World Bank, 2004) than of
              | the strictness of regulations per se.
              | Properties acquired by residents of Slovenia before the split of the former
              | Yugoslavia are not affected by this regulation. Many vacation homes owned by res-
              | idents of other former Yugoslav republics before 1991 have been sold in the mean-
              | time. However, the status of many resort properties and much commercial real
              | estate owned by companies from the former republics is still unresolved (see
              | Nacional, 22 June 2004 [www.nacional.hr]).
              | Similar data were earlier quoted in Slobodna Dalmacija, 26 August 2004

              | inquired about this issue in the parliament.
              | Different news media have reported vastly different approval rates. According to
              | Financial Times, approval to buy property is given to 95–98% of all applicants (FT
              | House and Home, 15–16 May 2004; www.ft.com). However, according to Slobodna
              | Dalmacija (26 August 2004) and Novi list (13 September 2004; www.novilist.hr),
              | approval to buy property has been given to only 36% of applicants, which is closer
              | to the subsequently reported official figures shown in Table 1.

              | viii Property speculation is usually defined as the holding of unimproved or under-
              | improved property for the purpose of reselling profitably without any substantial
              | capital investment. Local authorities in Croatia currently impose a tax on unused
              | land for construction and commercial property; however, the tax rate is fairly low
              | (up to a maximum of 15 kuna, or 2 euros, per square meter), and unused residen-
              | tial property is not taxed (see Kesner-Škreb and Kuliš, 2001).
              | ix The Croatian tax authorities define capital gains on property sales as the differ-
              | ence between the sale price and the purchase price of property adjusted for the
              | producer price index of industrial products (see Law on the income tax, NN
              | 127/2000, 150/2002 and 163/2003, paragraph 23). In other words, any increase in
              | the value of property due to producer price inflation is not taxed.

              | xx This comparison assumes that in equilibrium the number of households is equal to
              | the number of permanently occupied dwellings.
              | xxi Temporarily unoccupied dwellings include vacant dwellings for rent or sale; those
              | that are not used or rented by their owners; and those that are being refurbished.
              | Note that vacation homes and apartments are not included in this category.
              | xxii Comparable data for the more recent years are not available because of change in
              | statistical methodology.
              | xxiii Data for the coastal area and islands are approximated from census data for 7
              | counties abutting the sea.
              | xxiv See for instance International Herald Tribune, 7 June 2004 [www.iht.com]; Financial
              | Times, 15–16 May 2004 and Daily Mirror, 8 July 2004 [www.mirror.co.uk].
              | xxv See Vjesnik, 14–15 August 2004, pages 20–21.
              | xxvi See for instance Veèernji list, 20 September 2004 [www.vecernji-list.hr].
              | According to Vjesnik (14–15 August 2004) and Slobodna Dalmacija (22 September
              | 2004), prices of land increased in many areas of the Adriatic by over 100% in two
              | years and, depending on the location, varied from 20–500 euros per m2.
              | xxvii Newly completed properties are subject to the VAT at a rate of 22%, while sales
              | of existing properties are subject to a 5% tax on real estate sales; see Kesner-Škreb
              | and Kuliš (2001).

              | xxx In the OECD countries, average house prices have not declined in nominal terms
              | in any year since 1945.
              | xxxi Housing loans account for 67% of total loans to households in the euro area and
              | 64% in Hungary.
              | xxxii For instance, in the municipal court in Zagreb there were 1,200 cases of foreclo-
              | sure involving auctions of seized properties in the past four years (Dnevnik, 24
              | May 2004; www.dnevnik.com). In the municipal court in Split, 380 such cases
              | were being processed in early 2004 (Slobodna Dalmacija, 7 May 2004).
              | xxxiii The figure on net earnings was obtained as the product of average net earnings
              | in 2003 (3,918 kuna per month) and average number of persons in paid employ-
              | ment in legal entities during 2003 (1.39 million).
              | xxxiv See Dnevnik, 23 September 2004.
              | xxxv See the web page of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Physical Planning
              | and Construction [www.mzopu.hr].
              | xxxvi Down payment amounts to 131 euros per m2, and monthly debt servicing cost to
              | about 160 euros for a 40,000 apartment [www.mzopu.hr]. As noted above, aver-
              | age monthly personal income in 2003 was about 520 euros.
              | xxxvii A personal anecdote illustrates this point: when the author started his first job in
              | 1982 and inquired about the burden of housing loans, one of his colleagues
              | replied: “It’s really easy: the first few months your entire salary goes to repay the
              | loan, and after a year or so the monthly payment costs the same as a bottle of
              | wine”.
              | xxxviii One should recognize at the same time that the current older generation is worse-
              | off in terms of health care costs, which were fully subsidized during socialism but
              | are now increasingly borne fully by the patients.
              | xxxix Another useful study is the tourism development strategy elaborated by the IZTZG
              | (2003).
              | xl These figures are adjusted for the latest data on GDP and employment in 2003.
              | The World Travel and Tourism Council (2004) used preliminary estimates of
              | these series. On this basis, the contribution of travel and tourism in 2003 was esti-
              | mated at 22.4% of GDP and 27.4% of total employment.
              | xli Estimates of price elasticities of demand by tourists from western Europe and the
              | United States for holidays in Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Turkey range
              | from –0.3 to –3.2. That is, a 1% increase in the price of a package holiday in
              | country A will reduce the demand for vacation in that country by western
              | European and US visitors by up to 3.2% (see Syrioupoulos and Sinclair, 1993).
              | xlii It is interesting to note that social science researchers (including in Croatia) have
              | shown considerable interest in sustainable tourism (see for instance Cariæ, 2003;
              | Creaco and Querini, 2003; Petriæ, 2003; and Petrin, 2004), but very little inter-
              | est in analytical work on the economics of tourism.
              | xliii Average income elasticity of demand for holidays in Italy is estimated at around
              | 2.0; in Greece and Turkey 1.8; Portugal 2.5; and in Spain 1.5. That is, a 1%
              | decrease in income of western European visitors is associated with a 2.5%
              | decrease in demand for holiday travel to Portugal (see Syrioupoulos, 1995).

text          | xlviii In the spring of 2004, a total of 185 properties were demolished (Vjesnik, 11
              | September 2004). The problem is even more pronounced in Albania: in January
              | 2003 the government said only 500 of the 3,000 buildings on the 450 km coast
              | were legal. It has since destroyed 1,000 and recently announced it would raze fur-
              | ther 300 illegally built hotels and restaurants (International Herald Tribune, 23
              | September 2004).

              | l See Government of Spain (1988) and Ministerio de medio ambiente (2004).
              | li For instance, Spain’s 65 hotel groups own some 30% of hotel capacity (the rest are
              | mostly small family-owned hotels). But only one-quarter of hotel groups have any
              | foreign capital, and in only half of these groups does foreign participation exceed
              | 50% of capital (Estudios Turisticos, 1988).
