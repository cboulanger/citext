              | Abstract
              | This article reviews the political history of Czechoslovakia as a vital part of the Soviet-dominated “Communist bloc” and its
              | repercussions for the journalist associations based in the country. Following an eventful history since 1918, Czechoslovakia
              | changed in 1948 from a liberal democracy into a Communist regime. This had significant consequences for journalists and
              | their national union and also for the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ), which had just established its head-
              | quarters in Prague. The second historical event to shake the political system was the “Prague Spring” of 1968 and its
              | aftermath among journalists and their unions. The third landmark was the “Velvet Revolution” of 1989, which played a
              | significant part in the fall of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and led to the closing of the old Union of Journalists
              | in 1990, followed by the founding of a new Syndicate which refused to serve as the host of the IOJ. This led to a gradual
              | disintegration and the closing down of what in the 1980s was the world’s largest non-governmental organization in the
              | media field.

              | 1. Introduction
              | The starting point of this article is a story about the rise
              | and fall of the IOJ—an international non-governmental
              | organization of journalists based in Czechoslovakia,
              | which had become an icon of the changing political land-
              | scape of the world since 1946. The same story has been
              | told in an anthology of the history of the international
              | movement of journalists (Nordernstreng, Björk, Beyers-
              | dorf, Høyer, & Lauk, 2016) and also in a monograph on
              | the IOJ (Nordenstreng, in press), but this was done with-
              | out covering the broader context of the political history
              | of Czechoslovakia. The present review aims to fill the gap
              | by first describing the key political turns in the history of
              | Czechoslovakia since World War I (Emmert, 2012).
              | 2. Political History of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to the
              | 1990s
              | 2.1. Four Periods between 1918 and 1948
              | If we wish to understand the events which took place in
              | post-war Czechoslovakia, particularly in February 1948,
              | when the Communist Party took over political power in
              | the country, we need to go back another thirty years.
              | Czechoslovak history divides the period between 1918
              | and 1948 into four main phases: the First Republic,
              | the Second Republic, the Protectorate of Bohemia and
              | Moravia and the Third Republic.
              | The period of the First Republic is defined by two
              | dates: 28 October 1918 (birth of independent Czechoslo-

text          | vakia) and 30 September 1938 (signing of the Munich
              | Agreement). In 1918 Czechoslovakia ceased to be part of
              | the Austro–Hungarian Empire and became an indepen-
              | dent republic with a democratic polity based on the Con-
              | stitution. The country consisted of Bohemia, Moravia,
              | Silesia, Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia. The Repub-
              | lic was characteristically multi-ethnic and there were ini-
              | tially large social, cultural and economic differences be-
              | tween its individual regions. The internal unity of the
              | new state was challenged by the German ethnic minor-
              | ity living in the border regions and wishing to become
              | part of Germany, and the leftist labour movement, which
              | founded the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (hence-
              | forward the CPC) in May 1924. In the short term, how-
              | ever, Czechoslovakia became a mature democratic re-
              | public with a broad spectrum of political parties, and
              | the republic advanced in leaps and bounds in the fields
              | of industry, trade, education and lifestyle. An extensive
              | print media developed, the press being primarily parti-
              | san, with a minority non-party press, tabloids and mag-
              | azines, and the new media of radio and film were evolv-
              | ing. Partial censorship existed and was carried out by the
              | Ministry of Interior. Publishers had to submit mandatory
              | copies to district authorities or police headquarters, who
              | had the right to withhold prints prior to their release, to
              | allow the issue only after a change or deletion of the
              | text or even confiscate the press (Končelík, Večeřa, &
              | Orság, 2010). Nevertheless, cultural openness and toler-
              | ance prevailed.
              | The next period of the Second Republic began with
              | the signing of the Munich Agreement and the creation of
              | the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia on 30 Septem-
              | ber 1938, lasting only until 15 March 1939. In this short
              | period, Czechoslovakia lost extensive border territories,
              | Slovakia, and Subcarpathian Ruthenia. Politically, the
              | country was subverted and the democratic principles of
              | the First Republic, organization and freedom were de-
              | stroyed. The Party of National Unity and the National
              | Labour Party became the only two political parties.1
              | Czechoslovak society perceived the Munich Agreement
              | as a defeat which threw it into disillusion and moral crisis.
              | These facts were also reflected in the media, with the dis-
              | appearance of many periodicals and the intensification
              | of censorship.
              | The third period between 16 March 1939 and 8
              | May 1945 is known as the Protectorate of Bohemia and
              | Moravia. The territory of the Protectorate included prac-
              | tically all of the present-day Czech Republic, so Nazi Ger-
              | many effectively occupied the entire country. The Czech
              | president formally remained Head of the Protectorate,
              | along with the Protectorate’s Czech government. Never-
              | theless, the real power—with a brutal and totalitarian
              | Nazi regime—was held by a Reichsprotektor, who was
              | hand-picked by Adolf Hitler. This means that the Ger-
              | mans had the Czech economy, industrial and agricultural
              | production, transport, education and culture fully under
              | their control. The media were controlled by a Nazi infor-
              | mation monopoly and subjected to severe censorship. In
              | addition to the official media, illegal and media in-exile
              | were quickly established. The Czech population was sub-
              | jected to a programme of Germanisation. Citizens of Jew-
              | ish origin were deprived of their civil rights, persecuted
              | in various ways, including the confiscation of property,
              | and, starting in the autumn of 1941, were gradually phys-
              | ically eliminated.
              | Understandably, the Czech people did not accept the
              | occupation and resistance to it soon emerged. These
              | activities culminated in the assassination of the Reich-
              | sprotektor. Meanwhile, the government-in-exile, led by
              | Edvard Beneš, was established in London. Any expres-
              | sions of anti-Nazi feeling were brutally suppressed by the
              | occupiers—punished by death, imprisonment or deten-
              | tion in a concentration camp. Nevertheless, a number
              | of Czechs cooperated—collaborated—with the occupy-
              | ing regime during the Protectorate. However, the major-
              | ity of the population continued to oppose the Germans
              | (Emmert, 2012) and, on 5 May 1945, resistance to the
              | occupation developed into an armed Prague uprising,2
              | which ended on 8 May 1945 with the defeat of Germany.
              | Finally, the fourth period from the May 1945 to Febru-
              | ary 1948 is called the Third Republic. The basic document
              | establishing the direction of Czechoslovakia after World
              | War II was the Košice Government Programme,3 which
              | introduced the first post-war Czechoslovak Government
              | heavily influenced by the USSR—the winner of the war.
              | It was drawn up by the Moscow-based leadership of the
              | CPC and proclaimed the confiscation of property belong-
              | ing to Germans, Hungarians and Czech collaborators, the
              | punishment of collaborators, an equal relationship be-
              | tween Czechs and Slovaks, the establishment of National
              | Committees4 and fundamental changes in the economic
              | and social spheres, as well as the banning of the activi-
              | ties of right-wing political parties. Accordingly, it not only
              | dealt with the punishment of war criminals, traitors and
              | collaborators, but also led to the rejection of the First
              | Republic’s political and economic system. Some Czech
              | 1 The political system of the Second Republic was simplified and there were only two main political parties: (1) an “official” right-wing Party of Na-
              | tional Unity (Strana národní jednoty) gathering together the Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants, Czechoslovak Traders’ Party, National Fascist
              | Community, Czechoslovak Christian Social Party, National People’s Party, and (2) in “loyal” opposition, the left-wing National Labour Party (Národní
              | strana práce).
              | 2 The Prague uprising was an attempt by the Czech resistance to liberate the city of Prague from German occupying forces. It lasted from 5 May until 8
              | May 1945, ending in a ceasefire between the Czech resistance and the German army, which decided to leave Prague on the same day. Next morning,
              | the Red Army entered the nearly liberated city.

              | 4 The National Committee (1945–1990; NC) was a part of the Czechoslovak state administration with formally elected bodies. The NC was divided ac-

              | arm” of the CPC for the economy and whole society.

text          | historians view this part of Czechoslovak history in two
              | ways: either as a short period of freedom squeezed in be-
              | tween two dictatorships (Nazi and Communist) or as the
              | trappings of democracy leading to the Communist snare.
              | (Drápala, 2000)
              | In May 1946 Czechoslovakia held its first post-war
              | parliamentary elections. A limited number of parties par-
              | ticipated in the election. While the CPC won in the Czech
              | lands with more than 40% of the vote, the Democratic
              | Party won in Slovakia with 60% of the vote. In June 1946,
              | the pre-war leader Edvard Beneš was confirmed as Presi-
              | dent of the Republic, and he appointed a government led
              | by CPC chairman Klement Gottwald. In October 1946, the
              | Czechoslovak National Assembly approved an economic
              | plan for the reconstruction of post-war Czechoslovakia.
              | In 1947 the USSR began to create the Eastern bloc
              | by arrangements such as a peace treaty concluded with
              | Hungary and a friendship and mutual assistance treaty
              | concluded with Poland. At this time Czechoslovakia fol-
              | lowed Moscow’s “advice” to withdraw from the Marshall
              | Plan and to sign a trade agreement with the USSR.
              | In the post-war atmosphere the liberalism and hu-
              | manism which characterized the First Republic were per-
              | ceived by the majority of society as the root of all evil,
              | which was to blame for the hardships of war, human
              | degradation and the total collapse of modern society.
              | The central theme of the time was socialism, which was
              | also complemented by nationalism and Slavonic patrio-
              | tism. In May 1945 the Ministry of Information issued a
              | Decree forbidding the publication of any printed mate-
              | rial, with the exception of selected dailies issued by Na-
              | tional Front parties. Further permission to publish was
              | only granted to those organisations which could prove
              | that this was in the public interest.
              | In the Third Republic immediately after the war, the
              | Czechoslovak press was made up of three ideological-
              | political types: (1) the Communist press and periodi-
              | cals with Communist sympathies, (2) a democratic left-
              | wing press and (3) the non-Socialist press. Censorship
              | was not exercised, although the press laws dating back
              | to the First Republic provided for it. But the situation
              | changed in autumn 1947, when the Communists began
              | to perceive censorship as an indispensable instrument
              | of power. In December 1947 the Ministry of Informa-
              | tion created the Surveillance Department, which aimed
              | to monitor objectionable texts dealing with the national
              | economic plan, incitement against the Slavonic peoples
              | as well as deviation from the basic line in domestic and
              | foreign policy and matters connected to the defence of
              | the state (Kaplan & Tomášek, 1994).
              | 2.2. The Communist Takeover of 1948
              | A dramatic government crisis started in Prague on 13
              | February 1948 when personnel changes in favour of the
              | Communists were made in the National Security Corps.
              | The response to the ever-increasing influence of the CPC
              | was the resignation of the non-Communist ministers, 12
              | members of a 26-member government, on 20 February
              | 1948. The CPC and groups sympathetic to it within indi-
              | vidual parties began to establish the National Front Ac-
              | tion Committees (NFAC), whose aim was to “cleanse” the
              | government and public life of all non-Communist politi-
              | cal forces. Two days later, the People’s Militia also came
              | into being, armed units consisting mostly of workers di-
              | rectly controlled by the CPC. Their main aim was the
              | defence of industrial enterprises and the intimidation
              | of their political (anti-Socialist) opponents. The conflict
              | continued on 24 February 1948 with an hour-long gen-
              | eral strike in support of the CPC’s requirements, and es-
              | calated on 25 February, when President Edvard Beneš
              | agreed to make changes in the government as suggested
              | by Klement Gottwald.
              | This is how Communists came to power in Czechoslo-
              | vakia—widely known as the “Communist coup”. In early
              | May, a new Constitution was approved, and the defini-
              | tive influence of the CPC in the country was formally con-
              | firmed on 30 May 1948 by the parliamentary elections.
              | All the parties stood on a single list of candidates led by
              | the CPC and 89% of the electorate voted for them. 70%
              | of members of the National Assembly were Communists,
              | and the remaining members from other parties were pro-
              | Communist. Finally, in June 1948, Klement Gottwald be-
              | came the new President.
              | At this stage the CPC brought society under totali-
              | tarian control. The economy was based on the princi-
              | ple of central planning, and companies with more than
              | 50 employees were nationalised. Under pressure from
              | Moscow, the CPC’s Central Committee began to take a
              | hard line against any criticism of the Communist system
              | or in favour of liberal thinking. There were a number of
              | fabricated political trials, forced labour camps were cre-
              | ated and the strict supervision of the censor covered not
              | only the field of culture, including the press, but also the
              | life of the Church. A counter-reaction to the situation was
              | a wave of emigration, during which a large community
              | of post-February 1948 emigrants founded publications
              | in exile. May 1951 saw the launch of Radio Free Europe
              | with regular broadcasts from Munich.
              | After February 1948 the CPC began to introduce cen-
              | sorship which would apply not only to the periodical and
              | non-periodical press, radio, film and the early days of TV,
              | but also to exhibitions, libraries, local records, posters,
              | advertising leaflets, badges, labels and the like. In this
              | way, the media became closely intertwined with the sys-
              | tem of political power, while the limits of journalistic
              | freedom were defined by the National Front and self-
              | censorship (Končelík et al., 2010). The system of censor-
              | ship policed the flow of information both at home and
              | abroad. There was a ban on importing foreign newspa-
              | pers and magazines, press agencies were shut down, as
              | were cultural centres and information offices with their
              | headquarters in the West. The state security routinely
              | monitored correspondence sent from and to capitalist
              | countries and so on. In the coming years, everything that

              | sor intervened not only in matters of content, but also
              | of form, and tried to influence production, print run and
              | scope. In this way, the Communist regime gained a total
              | information monopoly.
              | However, in the early 1950s, a more moderate cul-
              | tural policy was promoted. The reason for this was not
              | only the fact the Soviet ideas of socialist art had proved
              | problematic, but it was also a response to the growing
              | conflict within the CPC itself (Knapík, 2006). The concept
              | of the “new course”5 opened up the possibility of liberal-
              | isation in Czechoslovakia’s cultural sphere between 1953
              | and 1956. After the death of Josef Stalin in 1953 and
              | the criticism by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, the regime
              | began to look more kindly on some still-rejected person-
              | alities, less strict aesthetic criteria appeared, and even
              | some channels for contact with the West were intro-
              | duced. A new artistic generation began to take shape
              | that did not feel itself as bound to the dogmatic doctrines
              | of the late 1940s and early 1950s. While the Cold War
              | continued as an overall frame, it was possible to hope
              | for the promotion of liberalistic tendencies.
              | The pressure for reforms in the CPC and other as-
              | pects of everyday life increased after the mid-1960s. As
              | the reform supporters became increasingly recognized
              | in the CPC and public life, the liberal orientation in the
              | country and in the CPC gradually won the support of the
              | majority for a revised form of Communism.
              | 2.3. The Prague Spring of 1968
              | In 1968 the world was in turmoil, with the war in Viet-
              | nam, the civil rights movement in the USA and student
              | unrest throughout Europe, especially in France. It was a
              | unique year in post-war history, as 1848 had been a hun-
              | dred years earlier. And the “Prague Spring” became its
              | focal point.
              | For a short period, from January to August 1968,
              | there was a huge development among politicians, in-
              | tellectuals, students and ordinary public life spheres in
              | Czechoslovakia. The social and political criticism of the
              | system had been gradual and fundamental and was re-
              | flected in economy, central management, culture and
              | media. At the end of 1967 a crisis in the CPC itself
              | deepened and the party split into two groups: (1) con-
              | servatives, represented by Antonín Novotný, Czechoslo-
              | vak president and CPC first secretary, and (2) reform
              | Communists, who wanted to democratize the old poli-
              | tics. In January 1968 the big break happened, when An-
              | tonín Novotný was removed as first secretary of the CPC
              | and replaced by Alexander Dubček, a reform Communist
              | from Slovakia.
              | The motto of Dubček´s new political programme6
              | was “Socialism with a human face”. Although the Cze-
              | choslovak economy should still be based on state or
              | co-operative ownership, non-Communist parties, broad
              | public community and free elections should also be in-
              | volved in political power. Admission to leading positions
              | and universities should no longer be contingent upon
              | CPC membership. The reforms also abolished censorship
              | and an informal alliance developed between Dubček´s
              | leadership and journalists. Indeed, the media played a
              | crucial role in the Prague Spring (Končelík et al., 2010).
              | Freedom of speech flourished and different associations
              | like the scout movement were restored. The Prague
              | Spring changes were supported throughout society and
              | had a considerable international response.
              | However, the Soviet Communist Party, together with
              | its sister parties in other Socialist countries, were afraid
              | of this revival process, and this fear led to the occupa-
              | tion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact military forces
              | on 21 August 1968. From September 1968 the so-called
              | Moscow Protocol was implemented in Czechoslovakia.
              | The Czechoslovak population of course protested against
              | the occupation. The most radical act against the restora-
              | tion of the Communist dictatorship was that of Jan
              | Palach, a student of the Charles University, who burned
              | himself to death on 16 January 1969 at the Prague’s
              | Wenceslas Square. In April 1969 Gustáv Husák became
              | the first secretary of the Communist Party. Alexander
              | Dubček and his closest associates were soon removed
              | from public life and replaced by Soviet puppets. Every-
              | one who participated in the Prague Spring or disagreed
              | with the occupation was punished. Censorship was rein-
              | stated and thousands of books and films were banned.
              | Many Czechs and Slovaks left the country.
              | The Prague Spring was consequently brought to a
              | drastic end and replaced by a sweeping political pro-
              | cess called “Normalization” lasting for 20 years. Officially
              | Czechoslovakia was a faithful member of the Eastern
              | bloc, and the CPC bureaucratic apparatus was severely
              | controlling all aspects of life. Yet under the surface
              | there existed an underground culture, intellectual dis-
              | sent, samizdat and an exile literature. The CPC bureau-
              | cratic apparatus could no longer effectively control all
              | areas of society. The most significant manifestation of
              | the anti-Communist resistance was the publication of
              | Charter 77 with its civil movement established in January
              | 1977, led by writer and later Czechoslovak President Vá-
              | clav Havel and the university professor Jan Patočka.
              | 5 The “new course” (nový kurs) was proclaimed by the leadership of the CPC after the deaths of Stalin and Gottwald in 1953. Its result was a more be-
              | nign approach to the middle classes; forced collectivisation in villages was temporarily halted, auxiliary technical battalions were disbanded, political
              | trials were discontinued and the process of revising their outcomes began, etc. See http://www.edejiny.cz/obdobi-destalinizace-v-ceskoslovensku-1953-
              | %E2%80%93-1960
              | 6 There were two main documents determining the Prague Spring: (1) Dubček´s CPC Action programme posted on 5 April 1968, related to the politics
              | and reform steps of CPC, and (2) the “Two thousand words” document written by Ludvík Vaculík together with leading Czech scientists, published on
              | 27 July 1968. It was about the activation of the Czechoslovak public against the ever-evident pressure of the Soviet leadership against the reforms in
              | the country. The manifesto was signed by hundreds of public figures and more than 120,000 citizens, which led to the persecution of many people in
              | the period of normalization in the 1970s.

text          | 2.4. The Velvet Revolution of 1989
              | The resistance to the Communist regime began to in-
              | crease in the late 1980s, in connection with Mikhail Gor-
              | bachev’s rise to power in the USSR and policy of per-
              | estroika and glasnost. The CPC claimed to agree with
              | this Soviet reform policy, but this was rather lip service.
              | Demonstrations of disagreement with the totalitarian
              | regime proliferated, but were also severely suppressed
              | by the security forces.
              | The most important actions took place on (1) 28 Oc-
              | tober 1988, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the
              | Czechoslovak Republic, (2) 16 January 1989, the 20th an-
              | niversary of Jan Palach’s suicide, and (3) 29 June 1989,
              | the publication of “A Few Sentences”, a call by dissident
              | leaders for the release of political prisoners, open and
              | free discussion, including thorny historical issues, and
              | the end of censorship.7 The crucial event which precip-
              | itated the Velvet Revolution, happened on 17 Novem-
              | ber 1989 in the centre of Prague, when security po-
              | lice blocked and violently broke up a student procession
              | to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Interna-
              | tional Day of Students. The fundamental response to this
              | armed intervention was the founding of the Civic Forum,
              | headed by Václav Havel, to begin a dialogue with the
              | Communist leaders. Massive demonstrations took place
              | throughout Czechoslovakia in support of the Civic Forum,
              | and university students went on strike.
              | On 24 November 1989, the CPC’s secretary gen-
              | eral Ladislav Adamec and his entire central commit-
              | tee withdrew. The name of the state was changed to
              | Czecho-Slovak Federative Republic and the head of the
              | Federal assembly became Prague Spring leader Alexan-
              | der Dubček. On 29 December 1989 Václav Havel was
              | elected as the new President. During 1990 Czechoslo-
              | vakia became a federal republic and the transformation
              | of Czechoslovak society and its economic, social and
              | political life from Communist totalitarianism to liberal
              | democracy could begin after long 40 years.
              | 3. The Journalists and Their Union 1946–1990
              | After World War II, there were naturally significant
              | changes in journalism as a profession. Before 1946 jour-
              | nalists were represented by the protectorate National
              | Union of Journalists (NUJ; see more on this in Cebe, 2017,
              | in this issue). The Czech Journalists’ Union (hencefor-
              | ward the CJU)8 came into being at a general meeting in
              | March 1946. On that occasion it was also agreed that pro-
              | fessional matters should in future fall under the remit of
              | the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement.9 The CJU rep-
              | resented a community of altogether about 800 journal-
              | ists (Cebe, 2012). In 1947, following the Act on the Status
              | of Editors and Journalists’ Unions, two journalists’ unions
              | were formed, the Czech union (formerly CJU) and the Slo-
              | vak union, while above them an umbrella organization
              | was established, the Central Union of Czechoslovak Jour-
              | nalists (CUCSJ). In May 1947 the government passed the
              | Act on the Status of Editors and Journalists’ Unions.10 In
              | fact, the CJU and CUCSJ were more a tool of the regime
              | than a provider of benefits to journalists.
              | On this basis, the practice of journalism was tied
              | to compulsory membership of the CJU, which had dire
              | consequences for many journalists in the post-February
              | cleansing. After February 1948, there were dynamic po-
              | litical and social changes. Even in the CJU action com-
              | mittees were founded and only those journalists who
              | were willing to work with the newly-established regime
              | remained members of the Union. The others were ex-
              | cluded from their professional organization and thereby
              | lost all chances of working in the media. The NFAC forced
              | more than one hundred experienced journalists to leave
              | and consequently affected the Czechoslovak media for
              | decades. (Cebe, 2012)
              | The new Communist Constitution of May 1948 had
              | two main consequences for journalists and their union.
              | Firstly, although the new Constitution guaranteed free-
              | dom of expression and prohibited censorship, the CPC
              | consistently monitored all media production, making in-
              | dependent media in practice impossible. The journalist
              | became a mere instrument lacking any autonomy, pro-
              | viding information on only politically-approved interpre-
              | tations of events. The economy was only to be portrayed
              | as flourishing, accompanied by the people’s efforts to
              | build it up. In the same way, both sports and scientific
              | achievements were to be ascribed to the merits of the
              | new Communist regime. The most significant instrument
              | for controlling the media was, of course, the staffing pol-
              | icy, meaning that journalists were in constant fear of los-
              | ing their jobs. (Končelík et al., 2010)
              | Secondly, a new, integrated Union of Czechoslovak
              | Journalists (UCSJ; 1948–1972), headquartered in Prague,
              | was founded and, within it, the National Union of Slovak
              | Journalists, headquartered in Bratislava. The state, rather
              | than the UCSJ, made the decisions regarding its focus,
              | organizational structure or the exercise of the journal-

              | (Ševčíková, 2015).
              | 9 The Revolutionary Trade Union Movement Act was passed on 16 May 1946. In 1947, the decision was taken that the CJU should also fulfil the function
              | of a trade union. Divisional membership was voluntary; however, the CJU pointed out to its members that the CJU would not represent them in profes-
              | sional issues if they were not members of the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement. From 1 January 1948, the Agreement on the Entry of Journalists
              | into the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement came into force and after that date, the majority of journalists joined a trade union.
              | 10 Act No. 101/1974 Coll. It stipulated, among other things, who could become an editor, laid down the rights and responsibilities of editors, including
              | the right of the Union to take disciplinary action against its members.

              | organization toed the Communist party line throughout
              | its existence.
              | From 1948, the CJU and UCSJ also served as the gate-
              | way to international organizations, above all to the IOJ. In
              | July 1968, following the events of the Prague Spring, the
              | UCSJ held a landmark congress. A new statute and sev-
              | eral resolutions were adopted in support of a new model
              | of Socialism (“with a human face”), democracy and free-
              | dom of the press, speech and information. The former
              | UCSJ was abolished and new Unions of Czech (UCJ, 1968–
              | 1972) and Slovak (USJ, 1968–1972) Journalists, includ-
              | ing an umbrella organization (Headquarters, 1968–1972)
              | were formed.
              | The new organizational model continued until Au-
              | gust 1968. Both the Headquarters and UCJ were under
              | the control of the Commission for the Preparation of the
              | II Congress of the UCJ, which soon overturned all the de-
              | cisions of the previous leadership and set up a cleansing
              | commission on the basis of which 479 journalists were
              | excluded from the Union and therefore also from their
              | profession between September 1968 to March 1970, fol-
              | lowed in 1972 by another 800 journalists.
              | As of 1971 the whole union had a complete overhaul
              | in the line of normalization. In May 1972 a congress was
              | convened at which the Czech Union of Journalists (CUJ,
              | 1972–1990), the Slovak Union of Journalists (SUJ, 1972–
              | 1990) and the National Czechoslovak Union of Journalists
              | (NCSUJ, 1972–1990) were established.
              | The big breakup of the NCSUJ took place at the turn
              | of 1989 and 1990, due to the political events of the Vel-
              | vet Revolution and the end of the Communist regime. Im-
              | mediately after 17 November 1989, a new management
              | of the CUJ, including the Bureau and its secretariat, was
              | elected. At the same time, the new Bureau of the CUJ
              | convened a general meeting on 16 December 1989, at
              | which it was decided to create a new journalist organiza-
              | tion, with the form of a syndicate. The old Union (CUJ)
              | was dissolved at the extraordinary congress of the CUJ
              | on 6 January 1990, and the successor organization be-
              | came the Syndicate of Journalists of the Czech Republic,
              | as a voluntary, independent, non-political, professionally
              | united union of Czech and Moravian journalists. (Prouza,
              | 1990) The new Syndicate refused to join the IOJ and in-
              | stead became member of the IFJ.
              | 4. The IOJ from 1946 to the 1990s
              | 4.1. Founding and Split
              | The IOJ was founded at the International Congress of
              | Journalists in June 1946 in Copenhagen, the capital of
              | Denmark, which had only recently been liberated from
              | Nazi occupation. The congress was attended by 165 dele-
              | gates11 from 21 countries. The post-war atmosphere was
              | one of joy and optimism. In Czechoslovakia, this came
              | just after the post-war parliamentary elections, which
              | brought the Communists to power as the leading polit-
              | ical force (for details of the first IOJ congresses, see Nor-
              | denstreng & Kubka, 1988).
              | The provisional constitution was finalised and ap-
              | proved at the second IOJ congress held in Prague in June
              | 1947 and attended by 208 delegates from 21 countries,
              | the UN and UNESCO. The CJU, led by Jiří Hronek, was re-
              | sponsible for organizing the congress and its patron was
              | President Edvard Beneš, who spoke at the opening cere-
              | mony, as did Jan Masaryk (Czechoslovak Minister of For-
              | eign Affairs) and Klement Gottwald (Prime Minister and
              | CPC Chairman).
              | The same positive atmosphere prevailed at the sec-
              | ond congress in Prague as one year earlier in Copen-
              | hagen, although some tension about the impending di-
              | vision of the world could already be sensed. While the
              | host union was in the middle of structural and politi-
              | cal changes, the congress went smoothly in impressive
              | settings. The constitutional statutes and principal reso-
              | lutions were approved unanimously, likewise the leader-
              | ship elected, with Archibald Kenyon of the UK continuing
              | as President and Vice Presidents coming from the USA,
              | USSR, France and Denmark. Hronek was unanimously
              | elected to the combined office of Secretary General and
              | Treasurer. But the site of the headquarters had to be put
              | to a vote, the majority supporting Prague, while a minor-
              | ity led by British and Americans voted for London.
              | In less than a year after the Prague congress, by early
              | 1948, the Cold War had broken out and a wave of po-
              | litical system changes in Central and Eastern Europe led
              | to a division of Europe into East and West, separated by
              | the “iron curtain”. The IOJ was part of this battleground,
              | becoming embroiled in Cold-War politics (Nordenstreng
              | et al., 2016). The post-war unity of professional journal-
              | ists was quickly replaced by distrust and antagonism be-
              | tween the capitalist West and the socialist East, exac-
              | erbated by political mobilization in both camps. Efforts
              | by the Czech Secretary General Hronek and the British
              | President Kenyon to hold the IOJ together were over-
              | ruled by orders from Cold-War strategists in London and
              | Washington, on the one hand, and the Soviet Communist
              | Party hardliners in Moscow, on the other (Nordenstreng,
              | in press).
              | The IOJ headquarters in Prague chose the Soviet
              | side of the political divide as swiftly as the Czechoslovak
              | Union was moved to the Socialist camp. These two pro-
              | cesses were parallel and obviously reflections of a com-
              | mon overall shift in global relations of power.
              | In 1948–1949 the IOJ lost its West European and
              | North American members, except for left-leaning groups
              | of journalists there (mainly in France and Finland). The
              | third IOJ congress in Helsinki in 1950 confirmed the
              | change by changing the statutes in line with the Commu-
              | nist approach, the bulk of the membership in the Social-
              | ist countries of Central–Eastern Europe and newly inde-
              | 11 The Czechoslovak delegation to the Congress was represented by CJU Chairman Otakar Wünsch, Jiří Hronek, K. F. Zieris (CJU secretary) and Emil
              | Štefan (USJ).

              | nist China.
              | The IOJ had become one of the “democratic inter-
              | national organizations” closely associated with the USSR.
              | The Western journalists’ associations established a new
              | International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) in Brussels in
              | 1952—as part of the “Free West” countering the “Com-
              | munist East”. The Cold War politics led to the loss of the
              | IOJ’s affiliation with the UN and UNESCO, but it gained
              | new members in the developing countries of Africa, Asia
              | and Latin America. In 1966, its membership amounted
              | to 130,000 journalists in 108 countries, while the IFJ had
              | 55,000 members in 31 countries.
              | 4.2. The Prague Spring
              | The IOJ continued to grow despite turmoil in its political
              | environment caused by the Prague Spring in 1968 and its
              | aftermath. The IOJ had its premises in the building of the
              | Czechoslovak Union UCSJ, and in August 1968 the whole
              | building was occupied by Warsaw pact forces. However,
              | the IOJ was soon allowed to return to its premises and
              | continued more or less as before, while the reformist
              | Czechoslovak Union was effectively replaced by a new
              | CJU (see above).
              | Unlike in 1948, the IOJ did not dramatically follow the
              | system change implemented in the national union. Actu-
              | ally the IOJ activities, including the monthly publication
              | The Democratic Journalist, had since the 1950s remained
              | quite true to the “Moscow line”, with no symptoms of
              | the Prague Spring. By the 1970s the IOJ was firmly con-
              | solidated on the basis established in the late 1940s, now
              | increasingly dominated by an “anti-imperialist” orienta-
              | tion reflecting the concerns of the developing countries
              | and meeting the Soviet interests. The changing climate
              | of international relations was also instrumental to rein-
              | stating IOJ’s affiliation with the UN and UNESCO.
              | Financial support for more and more activities
              | around the world came not only from the nominal mem-
              | bership fees but from public “solidarity lotteries” in
              | East European Socialist countries. Moreover, a peculiar
              | source for financing was invented by new Secretary Gen-
              | eral Jiří Kubka together with the Hungarian Treasurer
              | Norbert Siklósi: the IOJ was permitted, with the blessing
              | of the Communist Party, to establish commercial com-
              | panies in translation and conference services, publish-
              | ing, etc. This privilege made the IOJ quite rich, facili-
              | tating a large secretariat with a publishing house, train-
              | ing schools in European Socialist counties, regional cen-
              | tres on all developing continents and large conferences
              | around the world.
              | The heyday of the IOJ was in the late 1980s, when
              | its membership reached 300,000. By this time its polit-
              | ical line had become much more open and broad, par-
              | ticularly by its active engagement in East–West détente
              | from 1973 on, leading gradually to contacts and even
              | cooperation with the IFJ in the 1980s (Nordenstreng
              | et al., 2016).
              | 4.3. The Velvet Revolution
              | The Cold War world order began to crumble in late
              | 1989, when first the Berlin Wall fell and then Prague was
              | shaken by the Velvet Revolution, followed by the fall of
              | Communism in Eastern Europe. Global geopolitics was
              | suddenly changed and the IOJ was challenged: its head-
              | quarters and operations in Prague came under sharp at-
              | tack from the rising political forces in Czechoslovakia,
              | and its local member Union—the legal base for its seat
              | in Prague—was closed down and replaced by a new Syn-
              | dicate which did not want to affiliate with the IOJ but
              | joined the IFJ. Moreover, other strong member unions
              | in former Socialist countries, notably the USSR, began to
              | lose political and material ground. The IOJ’s financial re-
              | sources were rapidly dwindling and activities in training,
              | publication, etc. were gradually discontinued.
              | Nevertheless, in 1991 the IOJ held its 11th congress
              | in Harare in fairly good shape, but by its 12th congress in
              | Amman in 1995 it was crippled by shrinking finances and
              | quarrelling leadership. After this, member unions one af-
              | ter another decided to join the IFJ, while most of them
              | also remained nominal members of the IOJ. By the end
              | of the 1990s the IOJ had in fact disappeared from the
              | scene, whereas the IFJ had grown into an organization
              | also representing the bulk of the earlier IOJ membership.
              | Finally, in 2016, the last two IOJ presidents pronounced
              | the IOJ effectively dead (Nordenstreng, in press).
              | 5. Conclusion
              | In summary: (1) the system change in 1948 from lib-
              | eral democracy to Communism in Czechoslovakia imme-
              | diately involved journalists with their national associa-
              | tion, and the IOJ followed suit driven by the same devel-
              | opments among all the Soviet-dominated Eastern Euro-
              | pean member associations, while the Western members
              | withdrew without an organizational fight; (2) the system
              | instability of 1968 with an attempt to liberalize Commu-
              | nism hit the national association hard but did not extend
              | to the IOJ, which continued largely unchanged; (3) the
              | system change in 1989 caused an immediate upheaval in
              | the national association and the gradual disintegration
              | of the IOJ, again as a result of changes throughout the
              | Soviet block—a reverse process of 1948.
              | The story of Czechoslovak journalist organizations
              | and the IOJ adds further evidence to the overall lesson
              | presented in Nordenstreng et al. (2016, p. 180): inter-
              | national journalists’ associations are invariably bound by
              | their political environments and to believe that journal-
              | ists and their associations can ever be completely apolit-
              | ical is a naïve illusion. However, the international move-
              | ment is not deterministically driven by politics alone;
              | it is also driven by professional interests with more or
              | less autonomy.
              | This article has mostly concerned the political history
              | of Czechoslovakia, which already suggests another gen-
              | eral conclusion: in order to understand the relationship

              | tions, have to political system changes, it is vital to have
              | a profound knowledge of the history of the country in

              | ists studied with a superficial understanding of the his-
              | torical context.
