              | The “Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations” project
              | is an interdisciplinary cross-cultural study on values, fertility,
              | and intergenerational relationships. The VOC study focuses on
              | reasons for having or not having children and investigates the in-
              | terplay of values and parent-child relationships in three genera-
              | tions and across cultures (cf. Trommsdorff/Kim/Nauck 2005;
              | Trommsdorff/Nauck 2005, 2006, 2010). By now, a large data set
              | with N = 16.461 participants (adolescents, their mothers and ma- Isabelle Albert
              | ternal grandmothers and a sample of mothers with small chil-
              | dren) is available from nineteen different countries in four continents.
              | This report focuses on recent innovative research questions that are currently tackled
              | by international researchers involved in the project. These topics refer to three thematic
              | areas: value of children, intergenerational relations, and value transmission from a cross-
              | cultural perspective. These research questions have been raised in the framework of a re-
              | cent international workshop on “Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations”, or-
              | ganized by Gisela Trommsdorff and Bernhard Nauck, principle investigators of the pro-
              | ject, at the University of Konstanz (March 29th to 30th, 2012), and financially supported
              | by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). Some of the studies briefly summarized
              | below will be submitted for publication.

text          | Value of Children – Cross-Cultural Comparisons
              | The first part of this report concentrates on cross-cultural comparisons concerning “Value
              | of Children”.
              | Gender preference. Daniela Klaus and Arun Tipandjan ask in their current work for rea-
              | sons for higher son preference in North compared to South India (e.g., Pande/Astone
              | 2007). They assume that the higher preference for sons in North India can be explained by
              | the rigid patrilineal rules, higher religiosity, and dry agriculture. On the other hand, they

              | 114 J. Ziehm, I. Albert: “Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations”
              | assume that the lower son preference in South India can be explained by higher economic
              | positions and higher educational attainment. Initial analyses indicate that the investigated
              | socio-economic factors and the cultural context can only partly explain the different re-
              | gional son preferences. They offer the preliminary conclusion that “sex-specific costs and
              | benefits contribute to the explanation but they do not mediate between the considered
              | background variables and the son preference”.
              | Cultural differences in negative VOC. Isabelle Albert, Gisela Trommsdorff, and
              | Katarzyna Lubiewska argue that perceived negative aspects of parenthood may be im-
              | portant for the decision not to have children and may have a special explicative value re-
              | garding the current low fertility rates in many European countries (cf. Eurostat 2012). In
              | order to take into account different levels of socio-economic change, the researchers have
              | compared three different cohorts living in Western and Eastern Germany as well as in Po-
              | land in their preliminary analyses. Results show that the same negative aspects of having
              | children seem to be most prominent in all subsamples: e.g., worries about job, financial
              | situation, children’s future. Overall, mothers from East Germany and older mothers from
              | West Germany were less concerned about having children than mothers from Poland,
              | young mothers from West Germany and adolescents from all subsamples. In all countries
              | adolescents’ intentions about having children in the future were associated to their level
              | of negative VOC. Negative VOC was further related to actual negative experiences in the
              | family and low satisfaction with the actual living situation in all subsamples and cohorts.
              | 3 Intergenerational Relations: Inter- and Intracultural
              | Comparisons
              | Cross-cultural variations in intergenerational relations. In his recent work, Bernhard
              | Nauck argues that research on intergenerational solidarity and ambivalence suggests that
              | intergenerational relationships in wealthy societies are composed of both emotional
              | closeness and conflicts (e.g., Silverstein et al. 2010). The aim of his work is to extend this
              | approach to culturally and economically diverse areas with different kinship systems.
              | Nauck has identified four latent classes of intergenerational relationships (‘ambivalent’,
              | ‘amicable’, ‘disharmonious’, and ‘detached’) which were valid for matrilineal, patrilineal,
              | and bilineal kinship systems but varied in a systematic way. Results based on the VOC
              | data show that affection and conflict in intergenerational relationships are (apart from op-
              | portunities, individual choices, and internalized norms) also structured by institutional set-
              | tings. Nauck concludes that “intergenerational ambivalence is not restricted to Western
              | individualism, but depends on how ‘exit’ and ‘voice’ in intergenerational relationships are
              | institutionally structured in relation to emotional and functional interdependence”.
              | Adolescents’ motivation to support parents. Kairi Kasearu and Dagmar Kutsar note that
              | research on intergenerational solidarity is mostly limited to parents and grown-up chil-
              | dren. Hence, a current aim of the researchers is to investigate adolescents’ motives for
              | helping their parents in a cross-cultural comparison. Their initial analyses indicate lower
              | levels of adolescents’ agreement with helping motives in Germany compared to Estonia
              | and Russia. In Russia, the rule-oriented and reciprocal help-giving motives were more
              | highly valued than in the other countries, which might indicate higher collectivism and
              | Diskurs Kindheits- und Jugendforschung Heft 1-2013, S. 113-118 115
              | traditional family values (which is in line with Mayer/Kuramschew/Trommsdorff 2009).
              | In Estonia the relation-oriented motivation to help was relatively highly valued. Interest-
              | ingly, in Estonia and to a lesser extent in Russia, the relations-oriented motive was highly
              | positive correlated with the rule-oriented motive. According to the researchers, both mo-
              | tives refer to different aspects of normative solidarity: whereas external rule-oriented mo-
              | tives refer to meeting expectations of others, the relations-oriented motive might be inter-
              | preted as internal normative solidarity, assuming that readiness to help a parent is initiated
              | by the wish to sustain stability in the parent-child dyad.
              | Intergenerational solidarity and life satisfaction. The goal of an ongoing work by Wolf-
              | gang Friedlmeier and Katarzyna Lubiewska is to detect different dyadic structures of
              | intergenerational solidarity based on relevant components (affectual, consensual, asso-
              | ciational, functional, and normative) of the intergenerational solidarity model (e.g.,
              | Bengtson/Roberts 1991). The researchers have identified four major types of solidarity,
              | two of which occurred more often (harmonious and amicable) while the other two oc-
              | curred more rarely (ambivalent and distant). No cultural differences in the distributions
              | of patterns were found; however, dyads of daughters and mothers who did not have a
              | partner were more often characterized by distant solidarity in Poland and by ambivalent
              | solidarity in the USA. Results also showed that US daughters of “distant solidarity” dyads
              | scored higher on life satisfaction than US daughters of “ambivalent solidarity” dyads.
              | Polish mothers with “amicable” and “harmonious” patterns had higher life satisfaction
              | than Polish mothers with “distant” and “ambivalent” patterns of intergenerational soli-
              | darity.
              | Parenting and attachment. Katarzyna Lubiewska notes that past research has shown that
              | transmission of attachment is mainly associated with the quality of parenting (e.g., van
              | IJzendoorn/Bakermans-Kranenburg 1997). As past research included often only two gen-
              | erations, Lubiewska is now interested in the role of grandmothers and fathers in the
              | transmission process (e.g., Takahashi 2005). One of her expectations is that grandmothers
              | and fathers differ in their influence on attachment transmission among different regions of
              | Poland due to historical divisions and current socio-political and economical change with-
              | in Poland. Results of first analyses indicate that a prediction of adolescents’ attachment
              | anxiety can only be made by parents’ attachment and parenting as “transmission belt”. In-
              | terestingly, fathers’ anxiety was related to adolescents’ anxiety only in Southern regions,
              | whereas paternal avoidance influenced adolescents’ anxiety only in Western regions and
              | paternal rejection was predictive for adolescents’ anxiety in East Poland. Further, it was
              | found that culture functioned as a moderator between paternal attachment, rejection, and
              | adolescent anxiety.
              | 4 Intergenerational Transmission of Values in Cross-Cultural
              | Comparison
              | The intergenerational transmission of Value of Children. Chin-Chun Yi and Yu-Hua Chen
              | claim that one reason for the decreasing fertility rate in East Asia is the changing VOC
              | (e.g., Yu 2009). Therefore, the aim of their study is to figure out the transmission of VOC
              | in three generations in two Chinese societies, with a focus on identifying identical factor
              | 116 J. Ziehm, I. Albert: “Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations”
              | structures for cultural contexts for positive as well as for negative VOC. Analyses have
              | revealed for both China and Taiwan two factors for positive (physical/social and emotion-
              | al) as well as for negative VOC (physical/psychological constraint and familial/social
              | demand). Also, as hypothesized, the intergenerational transmission was more evident for
              | grandmother-mother and for mother-adolescent dyads than for grandmother-adolescent
              | dyads, especially for positive VOC. It was found that urban context and exposure to mo-
              | dernity functioned as significant predictors for positive and negative VOC.
              | Parent-child value similarities within and across cultures. Daniela Barni, Ariel Knafo,
              | Asher Ben-Arieh, and Muhammed M. Haj-Yahia want to address shortcomings of earlier
              | research that has typically measured intergenerational transmission of values by focusing
              | on parent-child value similarity, thereby neglecting the role of a shared background – the
              | “cultural stereotype” (Kenny/Acitelli 1994). In order to deal with this desideratum, the re-
              | searchers have compared samples from two different cultural contexts, focusing on value
              | similarity between parents and adolescent children. In general, the endorsement of cultur-
              | al stereotypes was higher for Italian than for Israeli participants, and was higher for moth-
              | ers than for adolescents. Regarding intergenerational transmission of values it was found
              | that collectivistic values were more strongly transmitted from parent to child, whereas
              | similarities in individualistic values could be partly explained by the effect of a cultural
              | stereotype. The researchers conclude that the transmission of socially-supported values
              | needs little investment from the family in a value homogenous context (family as a
              | “source of socio-cultural stability”). In a more value heterogeneous context the transmis-
              | sion of family specific values may be more successful (family as “source of socio-cultural
              | change”).
              | Adolescents’ relationship with maternal grandmothers. Mihaela Friedlmeier, Isabelle Al-
              | bert, Gisela Trommsdorff, and Cigdem Kagitcibasi investigate at present the relationship
              | quality between grandmothers and grandchildren by taking into account the role of the
              | mother as a mediator. It is presumed that mothers might influence the grandchild-
              | grandparent relation (e.g., Chan/Elder 2000). Most research on the mediating role of the
              | middle generation has been carried out in Western, individualistic contexts. Therefore, the
              | authors have chosen Germany and USA to represent individualistic cultures, and China
              | and Turkey to represent collectivist cultures. First results show that the middle generation
              | is an important mediator between non-adjacent generations, and this may point to an in-
              | tergenerational transmission of relationship quality. Interestingly, the quality of the ado-
              | lescent-mother relationship was more strongly linked to the adolescent-grandmother rela-
              | tionship than to the mother-grandmother relationship.
              | Value of Children and intergenerational relationships in adjacent generations. The study
              | by Boris Mayer, Beate Schwarz, and Gisela Trommsdorff includes ten cultures and fo-
              | cuses on country-level macro variables (social development and overall cultural orienta-
              | tion) as well as family-related value orientations regarding intergenerational (adult daugh-
              | ters and their mothers) relationship quality and social support. For example, it was found
              | that cultural wealth was related to lower hierarchical values and lower material interde-
              | pendence values of the family and children (which is in line with Kagitcibasi 2007). The
              | researchers reason that “cultural syndromes of independence and interdependence exist
              | regarding value orientations”, and they are associated with cultural wealth. However,
              | there was no evidence for such cultural syndromes with regard to relationship quality and
              | Diskurs Kindheits- und Jugendforschung Heft 1-2013, S. 113-118 117
              | support. Differences between collectivistic and individualistic cultures regarding intimate
              | family relations are rather a matter of “type rather than amount of relatedness”.
              | 5 Conclusions and Outlook
              | In the light of ongoing demographic changes all over the world and the related socio-
              | economic and cultural change, it has become more than ever necessary to relate context,
              | socio-economic change, family, and individual development. The currently ongoing stud-
              | ies within the VOC-framework take this claim into consideration by focusing and com-
              | bining different levels of analysis in line with the culture-informed model of intergenera-
              | tional relationships across the lifespan (see also Trommsdorff/Albert in press).
