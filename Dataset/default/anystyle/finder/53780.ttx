              | ABSTRACT
              | This article examines the concept of world unity from the time of enlightenment to the present
              | age. It asserts that the enlightenment conception is responsible for the perversion of human nature
              | since it elevates human reason over human emotion which has resulted into a narrow understanding of
              | the world and the belief that science could guarantee peace. The paper debates the concepts of space
              | and place in relation to westernization as a form of universalism. It shows how universalism is linked
              | to space with no respect for diverse cultures according to geographical origins as the case is for
              | localism which is rooted in place. It analyses the United States’ pursuit for market unity, a strategy
              | which is propagated but with the ill intentions of maintaining her international superiority. The market
              | unity project is indeed, an enemy of democracy and a threat to not only cultural diversity, but also to
              | all life on earth. In this paper I therefore suggest that, contrary to the critics, difference and the
              | horizontal structure of the Occupy Wall Street movement is advantageous. The fact that people are
              | organizing in protests in spite of their diverse cultures is, of course, an act of solidarity and unity. By
              | this they demonstrate their belief that a better world is possible and that valuing cultural diversity and
              | difference is a prerequisite for coexistence and peace. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to
              | defend difference and diversity against world unity or totality or sameness.

              | 1. INTRODUCTION
              | This paper is divided into three main parts. In the first part I will briefly discuss the idea
              | of unity, from the time of the Enlightenment to the present age. The Enlightenment
              | conception of unity led to a perversion of human nature that elevated human reason over
              | human emotion, and eventually led to a narrow understanding of the world, and the belief that
              | science could guarantee peace. Reason, it was believed, would eventually unify all knowledge
              | into absolute truth, which could be spread everywhere on earth.
              | I will also talk about the concepts of space and place in relation to Westernization a
              | form of universalism. I hope to show how universalism is connected to space and has no
              | respect for different cultures, and no longer has any geographical origin, whereas localism is
              | rooted in place. In place-centered worldviews context is of the utmost importance and
              | difference is respected. Also, the origins are clear and connected to geographical locations.

text          | The second part of this essay consists of a summary and analysis of the United States
              | pursuit for market unity as a way to maintain international superiority. This was used as a
              | means for keeping peace and containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War. However, we
              | will see that this project of market unity is, indeed, an enemy of democracy and a threat to,
              | not only cultural diversity, but also, all life on earth.
              | In the concluding part of this essay I point to encouraging signs of emerging social
              | movements that are motivated by disdain for the status quo and the unity of the market
              | system. I suggest, contrary to the critics, that difference and the horizontal structure of the
              | Occupy Wall Street movement is advantageous. The fact that people are organizing in protest
              | is, of course, an act of solidarity. One could even describe it as unity. The protesters are
              | unified only inasmuch as they oppose market unity. They believe that a better world is
              | possible, that alternatives exist, and that valuing cultural diversity and difference is a
              | prerequisite for coexistence and peace.
              | Diversity, after all, is a fundamental feature of life, but respect for and acceptance of
              | diversity by itself is not enough. It merely provides a basis for the negotiation of truths, which
              | can end in dynamic hybridity where place and context are respected while being
              | simultaneously conscious of what is going on in the space arena. Far from advocating for
              | isolationism, the main focus of this essay is aimed at defending difference and diversity
              | against world unity, and what Emmanuel Levinas calls totality or sameness (Morgan, 2007).
              | Levinas believed that “Western philosophy has been totalizing” because of its preoccupation
              | in discovering an ultimate Truth believed to unify everything (Morgan, 2007, 95). Hence,
              | Western philosophy has devalued difference and has resulted in what Levinas refers to as “the
              | triumph of the Same” (Morgan, 2007, 97).
              | 2. UNIVERSALISM: A WESTERN PROJECT
              | The Western utopian project of the Enlightenment was based on the idea that the
              | unification of human knowledge and the advancement of science would eventually liberate
              | mankind and ultimately lead to a more peaceful, rational world. All social phenomena and
              | conflicts in life, it was believed, could be rationally understood, and thereby, solved (Dietrich
              | and Sutzl, 2006). From this linear perspective, Europe was seen as the epicenter of progress
              | and civilization.
              | Human reason became a deity to be worshiped, and in many ways, it took the place of
              | Christianity as the central way of interpreting reality. Human emotion, on the other hand, was
              | relegated as the lower nature and devalued as irrational being associated with nature and
              | femininity. The Enlightenment quest of attaining universal truth is the foundation of
              | modernity, which is “characterized by Newtonian physics, Cartesian reductionism, the nation
              | state of Thomas Hobbes, and the capitalist world system” (Dietrich and Sutzl, 2006, 283).
              | Wolfgang Sachs, makes a fascinating distinction between space and place in order to
              | facilitate our understanding of how both universalism and localism function in the world.
              | Because universalism has “shed all vestiges of its particular origin, place and context, it
              | belongs nowhere and can therefore penetrate everywhere” (Sachs, 2006, 219). Hence, modern
              | universalism a product of the Enlightenment is a hegemonic project that makes absolute truth
              | claims for all cultures of the world and measures civilization in relation to its own narrow
              | conception of reality.
              | Localism, however, is rooted in place. In other words, it is connected to cultures
              | consisting of “particular peoples, memories and cosmologies.” Human experience is
meta          | 10
text          | Volume 10
              | connected to specific geographical places. Relationships, too, are intimately related to place.
              | When speaking of place, the context is respected. Furthermore, it is important to point out that
              | “place is not just the intersection of two lines on a map, but a concentration of meaningful
              | human activity which gives it a distinct quality, a distinct aura” (Sachs, 2006, 221).
              | Space-centered universal values have been reinvented and reformulated in various ways
              | throughout history. The conquistadores and European settlers, for example, sought to spread
              | Christianity often violently throughout the Americas. The Belgian King Leopold II claimed
              | that his conquest of Africa was intended to civilize the savages, and the British Empire
              | defined its imperialist ambitions as the White Man’s Burden, which claimed a responsibility
              | of bringing Western civilization to so-called backward cultures and peoples (Dietrich and
              | Sutzl, 2006). All of this culminated in the modern concept of development, which, at its core,
              | aims to spread the capitalist economic system characterized by an insatiable appetite for mass
              | production and industrialization. The capitalist system, which is a space-centered project,
              | threatens all subsistent societies with “machine-driven, large-scale and standardized
              | processes” (Dietrich and Sutzl, 2006, 287).
              | The impact of development on cultural and linguistic diversity has been devastating.
              | “Along with languages, entire conceptions of what it means to be human have evaporated
              | during the development decades since 1950. And yet, the death of languages is only the most
              | dramatic signal of the worldwide evaporation of cultures” (Sachs, 2006, 209). Sachs refers to
              | this destruction of diversity as the “homogenization of the world” (Sachs, 2006, 210). “The
              | history of the West is the history of the annihilation of countries and the extermination of
              | whole peoples and cultures” (Duchrow and Hinkelammert, 2004, 71).
              | The development period is marked by the peak of the linear belief that all cultures of
              | the world are on the same historical path, headed in the same direction. This ideology is
              | expressed in the UN Charter (Sachs, 2006). Tragically, in order to unify mankind by means of
              | development, people had to be “disembedded from their stories of the past, disconnected from
              | the context of their places, and detached from the bonds of their communities” (Sachs, 2006,
              | 211).
              | 3. THE UNITED STATES AND MARKET UNITY
              | Following World War II, the United States found itself as the major victor of the war
              | (along with the Soviet Union) and commenced to rebuild the world in its own image.
              | Globalization and unity of the market was viewed, by those in power in the U.S. government,
              | as the best and only way to maintain the superiority of the U.S. and achieve peace in the
              | world. When the Cold War began the U.S. government quickly created the either/or narrative
              | of good capitalist versus evil communist. This served Washington’s hegemonic aspirations
              | perfectly. It gave the U.S. a pretext for invading, occupying, and meddling in the affairs of
              | other countries around the world, as well as dividing the globe into allies and enemies. Of
              | course, the allies were always conveniently defined by Washington as those states that
              | adhered to capitalist market principles. Since the end of World War II the driving force
              | behind Westernization and the so-called civilizing process has undeniably been the U.S.
              | A new form of imperialism was born with its main objective being the pursuit of
              | global market unity (Sachs, 2006). The traditional way of exercising domination over others
              | was recast and disguised in the deceptive altruistic albeit ethnocentric language of
              | development. Truman stated in his inaugural address that “the United States is pre-eminent
              | among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques.” (Truman, 1949).
              | International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 10
meta          | 11
text          | And so it was narrowly assumed that the United States was the most advanced civilization,
              | possessing the one truth, with a moral responsibility of helping the rest of the world to
              | industrialize, particularly those cultures outside of the capitalist system with different ways of
              | being and relating to the world. Difference continues to be seen as an obstacle to development
              | and world economic unity. It has been noted that “the neo-liberal ideology of the absolute
              | market is presented as the only option, and all movements that resists it and its attendant
              | injustices must therefore be opposed” (Duchrow and Hinkelammert).
              | Sachs points out that this project for economic unity has actually become an oppressive
              | force to governments all over the world (Sachs, 2006). It is precisely this type of economic
              | competition that prevents countries from tackling more pressing problems, such as, looming
              | environmental catastrophes and pollution caused by capitalist production.
              | Duchrow and Hinkelammert give a dire assessment of the effects of market unity:
              | The globalization of the market means that the nation-state has less and less
              | power to intervene in economic policy when social considerations dictate.
              | Instead capital employs every conceivable means to drive profits ever higher,
              | without any consideration for people and the environment, and in this way
              | evades the constitutional obligation to sustain life (Duchrow and Hinkelammert,
              | 2004, 91).
              | “Not to lose ground in the economic arena has become an obsession which dominates politics
              | down to the local level” (Sachs, 2006, 215). The world market has become, as Sachs calls it, a
              | despotic dictator that dominates both rich and poor countries (Sachs, 2006, 215). Thus, the
              | quest for unifying all cultures into one Western overarching capitalist system has become a
              | threat to everyone everywhere, even to those who exercise power within the capitalist system.
              | The conquest of foreign markets trumped the conquest of foreign territories (Sachs,
              | 2006). Yet, the impact has been just as brutal and devastating to the conquered local
              | populations. As the capitalist system forces different cultures to conform to Western
              | consumerism in its quest for market unity, it marches towards an impending abyss, facing the
              | annihilation of all life on earth with the collapse of the ecosystem. Outrageously, the original
              | sin, namely global unity, is now being touted as the only solution to the advancing threat to
              | the environment. Again, the unity discourse has been recast, not to spread Western
              | civilization, but to save it (Sachs, 2006). The market has connected the world in such a way
              | that individual actions in one place may harm others living in a different place. We are now
              | living in a time where people are linked together by “their shared dependence on biophysical
              | life-support systems” (Sachs, 2006). Therefore, saving the planet from environmental global
              | destruction has increasingly become a national security objective for many countries. Sachs
              | writes, “Can you imagine a more powerful motive for forcing the world into line than that of
              | saving the planet?” (Sachs, 2006).
              | Even before the attacks of September 11th, the United States was already obsessed with
              | national security. Westernizing other cultures and those deemed as different is one of the
              | strategies employed by Washington to mitigate hostility toward the United States and the
              | capitalist system that it is built upon. Andrew J. Bacevich argues that after World War II
              | Washington believed that global responsibility fell upon the United States and “the United
              | States alone to lead, save, liberate, and ultimately transform the world” (Bacevich, 2010, 12).
              | The U.S. global war on terror is being used (like the Cold War) to justify its neoliberal
              | development policies and interference in other states’ politics. This has led the U.S.
              | government to continue and even expand its support for antidemocratic policies in other
              | countries. The unity of the global market has always been the actual objective of the U.S.
              | government and its capitalist partners. Using democratic language has merely served to
meta          | 12
text          | Volume 10
              | further U.S. imperialist ambitions of global market unity, not advance democracy. Universal
              | democracy has never been the real goal of U.S. foreign policy because democracy entails
              | allowing people to choose their own destinies and respects the autonomy of different cultures.
              | As other countries around the world industrialize and grow economically, particularly
              | Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS), the U.S. and other Western
              | economies feel immense pressure to compete economically. Despite the remarkable economic
              | growth of China, for example, it is still marked by many internal problems. “Though China
              | may have one of the world’s fastest-growing economies it has also become one of its most
              | unequal societies” (Harvey, 2005, 142).
              | Democratic and labor rights are extremely weak in China, and in many cases simply
              | nonexistent. The lack of workplace regulations has enabled businesses (including Western
              | corporations) to make obscene profits at workers’ expense. David Harvey, writing about a
              | form of neoliberalism with Chinese characteristics, notes that “wage levels in China are
              | extremely low, and conditions of labour are sufficiently unregulated, despotic, and
              | exploitative…” (Harvey, 2005, 148).
              | Yet, China has created an attractive business climate for international corporations.
              | And since China is not a democracy it is able to make economic decisions almost by decree
              | rather than debating issues for months and ending in a deadlock with nothing accomplished,
              | as it happens in the U.S. In short, capitalism in China is proving to be more efficient and
              | profitable an economic model to be emulated. The American pursuit of reshaping the world in
              | its image specifically by unifying the market is now threatening to eliminate democratic and
              | workers’ rights (achieved through class struggle) still remaining in the U.S. “The success of
              | Chinese communist-run capitalism is an ominous sign that the marriage between capitalism
              | and democracy is approaching a divorce” (Zizek, 2011).
              | The perceived limitation of democracy in contributing to economic growth has surely
              | been noticed by the U.S. government and the corporate elites who wield power over it. As a
              | consequence, politicians in the U.S. are attempting to strip away workers’ rights and all
              | regulations that may hinder the profits of giant corporations. Charles and David Koch the
              | fourth richest Americans have “promoted their free market ideology and business interests
              | through aggressive lobbying in Washington DC, and financial support of political candidates”
              | (Abeshouse, 2011). Furthermore, the Koch brothers are infamous for their support and
              | funding of the Tea Party and rightwing organizations that oppose government at almost every
              | level, except for protecting the profits of the super-rich. They see “virtually all regulation as
              | interference with the free market” (Abeshouse, 2011).
              | The aim of the West, and particularly the U.S., is to unify all countries under a capitalist
              | economic model; but now, as we are witnessing in the current economic crisis, all countries
              | within the Western capitalist tent are sharing in the pain and collapse of the capitalist system.
              | A universal solution is susceptible to error and can potentially lead to universal suffering.
              | This is precisely the danger of space-centered universalism. It puts all of its eggs into one
              | basket and gambles on the survival of life on earth.
              | It may be noteworthy to mention that the economic crisis of 2008 did not have as much
              | of an effect on Muslim countries with Islamic financial institutions. Indonesia, for example,
              | did not suffer economically like Western countries. “Islamic law prohibits the payment and
              | collection of interest.
              | Transactions must be backed by real assets, and because risk is shared between the bank
              | and the depositor, there is added incentive for the institutions to ensure deals are sound”
              | (Williamson, 2009). Hence difference was the redeeming factor. This is just one of many
              | examples of the failure of universalism as a dominant space-centered ideology.

text          | 4. CONCLUSION
              | The impact of space-centered universalism, which was a product of the Enlightenment,
              | has been devastating to cultures on every continent. The loss of indigenous wisdom,
              | creativity, and different ways of relating to the world, have created a dangerous unity of one
              | absolute truth, namely, the unity of global capitalism and the belief that Western civilization
              | is the best and only way to organize the world. Moreover, a multitude of languages that
              | enable unique varieties of human expression have been extinguished, never to be regained. As
              | other economies rise to rival the U.S., the universal virus of global capitalism the destroyer of
              | cultures forces those in power in the U.S. to deregulate industries and strip away democratic
              | rights in order to keep up with its competitors in a race to the bottom.
              | Despite this grim description of the hegemonic pursuit for unity, we may be comforted
              | by the recent emergence of social movements around the world that are discontent with the
              | status quo. From the Arab Spring to the Los Indignados in Spain, and finally, to the Occupy
              | Wall Street movement in the U.S., people are demanding alternatives to the market-driven
              | capitalist system that has eradicated diversity, increased the income gap between the rich and
              | poor, and is devastating the ecosystem.
              | The Occupy Wall Street Movement has been criticized for its lack of unity, leadership,
              | and ability to clearly articulate specific demands. These critics, however, fail to understand
              | that difference is indeed strength. In other words, the protesters are being criticized for not
              | being prescriptive, not having a universal solution already prepared. The discontent that is
              | manifested in these social movements is the result of the failure of Western universalism.
              | People are not demanding just one way for all peoples and cultures of the world, they are
              | demanding different ways to globalization and market-driven capitalism.
              | I am not suggesting that the protesters should not eventually make specific demands.
              | On the contrary, the protesters are already unified insofar as they are demanding alternatives
              | to universalism and the status quo. “Their basic message is: the taboo is broken; we do not
              | live in the best possible world; we are allowed, obliged even, to think about alternatives”
              | (Zizek, 2011).
              | The Occupy Wall Street movement has already had an impact on the political discourse
              | in Washington D.C. Those politicians who initially criticized the Occupy Wall Street
              | movement are now attempting to placate and hijack it for their own political advantage. “In
              | the same way we get coffee without caffeine, beer without alcohol, ice-cream without fat,
              | those in power will try to make the protests into a harmless moralistic gesture” (Zizek, 2011).
              | The horizontal structure of the movement allows it to be leaderless and creates an
              | egalitarian environment. This, I believe, is another important strength of the movement.
              | Thus, the arrest or killing of a beloved charismatic leader (i.e., Martin Luther King, Jr.) will
              | not pacify the movement. It also leaves those in power, who wish to crush the movement,
              | confused about how to stop it.
              | I will conclude with this quote by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek regarding the
              | Occupy Wall Street protesters:
              | They are dismissed as dreamers, but the true dreamers are those who think
              | things can go on indefinitely the way they are, just with some cosmetic changes.
              | They are not dreamers; they are the awakening from a dream that is turning into
              | a nightmare. They are not destroying anything, but reacting to how the system is
              | gradually destroying itself. We all know the classic scene from cartoons: the cat
              | reaches a precipice but goes on walking; it starts to fall only when it looks down
              | and notices the abyss. The protesters are just reminding those in power to look
              | down (Zizek, 2011).
