              | Abstract: »Performative Sozialwissenschaft und Psychologie«. This article
              | presents an overview of “Performative Social Science,” which is defined as the
              | deployment of different forms of artistic performance in the execution of a sci-
              | entific project. Such forms may include art, theater, poetry, music, dance, pho-
              | tography, fiction writing, and multi-media applications. Performative research
              | practices are in their developmental stage, with most of the major work appear-
              | ing in the last two decades. Frequently based on a social constructionist
              | metatheory, supporters reject a realist, or mapping view of representation, and
              | explore varieties of expressive forms for constructing worlds relevant to the
              | social sciences. The performative orientation often relies on a dramaturgical
              | approach that encompasses value-laden, emotionally charged topics and pres-
              | entations. Social scientists invested in social justice issues and political per-
              | spectives have been especially drawn to this approach. Performative social sci-
              | ence invites productive collaborations among various disciplinary fields and
              | between the sciences and arts.

              | 1. History and Disciplinary Dispersion
              | The term “performative” is drawn from J.L. Austin’s work, “How to do Things
              | with Words” (1962), in which he refers to the way in which utterances perform
              | various social functions over and above conveying content. Performative social
              | science involves the deployment of different forms of artistic performance in
              | the execution of the scientific project (M. Gergen, 2001). Such forms may
              | include art, theater, poetry, music, dance, photography, fiction writing, and
              | multi-media applications (Madison & Hamera, 2006). Performance-oriented
              | research may be presented in textual form, but also before live audiences, or in
              | various media forms (film, photographs, websites).

              | Within the social sciences, especially anthropology and sociology, research-
              | ers have studied performances, such as rituals, games, dances and dramas, in
              | hundreds of cultural settings. These studies have generally been represented in
              | traditional textual form. This summary excludes these types of performance
              | studies because they are not, in themselves, examples of performative research
              | (cf. Carlson, 1996; Conquergood, 1992; Schechner, 1985, 2002; Turner, 1986).
              | The exploration of performative research practices is in its nascent stage,
              | with most of the major work appearing in the last two decades. However, inter-
              | est in performatively oriented inquiry has been increasing rapidly. Lively con-
              | troversy surrounds such efforts, in part because they raise significant questions
              | regarding the nature of science (Marcus, 1994). Further, such exploration calls
              | attention to the various ways in which all methods of inquiry and representation
              | are performances. Questions thus emerge as to their comparative efficacy in
              | terms of achieving social ends (K. Gergen, 2009). The use of theater in com-
              | municating about the nature of prejudice, for example, has a far different im-
              | pact on one’s audience than a graphic or statistical form of representation. A
              | performative orientation to research often relies on dramaturgical theory in its
              | approach to human action, although a commitment to such a theory is not re-
              | quired by this orientation (Goffman, 1959; Newman & Holzman, 1996).
              | The performative orientation to social research has many and varied roots,
              | both within the social sciences and without. In philosophy the distinction be-
              | tween science and art has long been questioned, with scholars pointing to the
              | various ways in which scientific theory and descriptions are suffused with
              | literary tropes (e.g. metaphors, narratives), and guided by visual imagery (e.g.,
              | waves, matrices). In this vein, science is not defined by virtue of its contrast
              | with performance; it is itself a form of performance (see, for example, Arn-
              | heim, 1969; McCloskey, 1985). Sociologists have also had an interest in per-
              | formance-oriented research. The field of visual sociology, emphasizing photog-
              | raphy as a major means of illuminating the social world is but one realization
              | (see the International Visual Sociology Association). For example, Mark De
              | Rond, (2008a) in his ethnographic research of the University of Cambridge
              | rowing team, produced a flash video called “From Nausea to Method: The
              | Dark Night of the Ethnographer’s Soul” as well as a nonfiction book, “The Last
              | Amateurs: To Hell and Back with the Cambridge Boat Race Crew” (2008b);
              | De Rond describes his performative work as “carnal sociology.” Further, soci-
              | ologists invested in liberation politics, have found dramatic performance a
              | major means of engaging people in social change movements. The work of
              | Augusto Boal (1995) is seminal in this respect. Jonathan Shailor’s work with
              | prison populations (2010) is a recent realization of liberation theory. Many
              | Participatory Action researchers also rely on performance practices in their
              | studies (cf. Reason & Bradbury, 2000). For example, in her work with Guate-
meta          | 292
text          | malan women suffering from violence, Brinton Lykes has made extensive use
              | of photography.1 In psychology, the earliest uses of performance were largely
              | those of therapists. Jacob Moreno (1947), Joseph Wolpe (1969), Eric Berne
              | (1964) and George Kelly (1955) all played an important role in demonstrating
              | the ways in which performance may be used for exploration, both of one’s past
              | life and of potentials for future action. Outside the social sciences, the late 20th
              | century emergence of performance art has brought to attention the potentials of
              | uniting art and social commentary for stimulating social change (Carlson,
              | 1996).
              | These early contributions paved the way for a more recent flourishing of
              | performance oriented inquiry across a variety of disciplines. In Women’s Stud-
              | ies, such developments have been stimulated in particular by the view of gen-
              | der itself as a cultural performance – as opposed to a biological given (see
              | especially Butler, 1990, 1993). Thus when we engage in culturally appropriate
              | sex role behaviors, we are enacting roles as we have been taught to play them.
              | Other feminists have explored sexuality, embodiment, and power through
              | performative means (Lockford, 2004; Ronai, 1992). Issues of health and medi-
              | cal treatment for women with breast cancer became the focus of a Canadian
              | theater production. This work, using patients playing roles related to their own
              | disease, was later published as “Standing Ovation” (Gray & Sinding, 2002).
              | Performance forms have also been developed by scholars in Gay and Lesbian
              | studies. For example, after Colorado voters excluded homosexuals from state
              | anti-discrimination laws, psychologist Glenda Russell (2000; Russel & Bohan,
              | 1999) transformed filmed interviews from the event into a television program.
              | This show, “Inner Journeys, Public Stands,” was then nationally televised. The
              | interview materials were also used as the basis for an oratorio, “Fire,” com-
              | posed by Bob McDowell and performed on several occasions (see Russell,
              | 2000).
              | In the field of communication, important developments in performance have
              | emerged in ethnographic study. As scholars have developed autoethnography
              | to illustrate or illuminate various issues, so have they frequently experimented
              | with forms of expression (Ellis, 1991; Ellis & Bochner, 1996; McCall, 2000;
              | Pelias, 1999; see also Ellis, Adams & Bochner, 2010). Commonly, autoethno-
              | graphy takes on the qualities of dramatic writing (Ellis, 2004; Richardson,
              | 1997). With his graduate students, James Scheurich has produced a “research
              | happening,” designed to illuminate issues in immigration by bringing audience
              | members into interactive relations with artifacts and activities related to Mexi-
              | can immigrants, as well as a movie, “Labores de la Vida/The Labors of Life,”
              | with Miguel Guajardo and others (Scheurich, Guajardo, Sanchez & Fineman,
              | 1999) about migrant farm workers. Moving toward full-blown performance,

text          | Johnny Saldaña, professor at Arizona State University, has transformed a story
              | from his adolescence into a theatrical piece called “Second Chair” (2008), with
              | his music as well as prose. Online presentations allow for greater visual impact,
              | with diverse forms of dramatic forms, music and text. A Special Issue of FQS
              | included 42 contributions, emphasizing performative research projects (Jones
              | et al., 20082).
              | In psychology, performance studies were highlighted at symposia presented
              | over a five year period, 1995-1999, at the American Psychological Association
              | national meetings. Sessions were composed of dramatic monologues, dance,
              | multi-media presentations, plays, and poems, all treating a significant topic of
              | psychological concern. Another major innovator in performance studies is the
              | East Side Institute, where dramatic productions are integral to educational,
              | therapeutic and community building functions (Newman & Holzman, 1996).
              | Kenneth J. Gergen (2009) has co-created graphic and poetic representations of
              | theoretical views with artist, Regine Walter. Mary Gergen’s dramatic mono-
              | logues and textual formats, lodged at the intersection of social construction and
              | feminist studies, are among the earliest performative presentations in psychol-
              | ogy (K. Gergen & M. Gergen, 2001; M. Gergen, 2001).
              | As many qualitative researchers find, the traditional distinctions among de-
              | partments of knowledge are both artificial and insulating. Thus emerging are a
              | variety of publication and presentation venues that are non-disciplinary. The
              | annual International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry organized by Norman
              | DENZIN at the University of Illinois is illustrative; over two thousand re-
              | searchers gather to present their work, much of it of a performative nature.
              | Conference themes are generated around the idea that qualitative methods
              | should serve social justice goals.
              | 2. Theoretical and Methodological Premises
              | Developments in performance inquiry have been primarily stimulated by the
              | emergence of a social constructionist alternative to traditional empiricist view
              | of science. From the constructionist standpoint, one’s observations of the world
              | make no principled demands on the forms of communication used to represent
              | these observations. There are no words – or other symbolic forms of represen-
              | tation – that are uniquely suited to account for whatever exists. From this
              | standpoint, inquiry is invited into the limitations of traditional forms of social
              | science writing (along with graphic and tabular representations of the world),
              | and the potentials of alternative modes of expression. The use of performance
              | 2 <http: www.qualitative-research.net="" index.php="" fqs="" issue="" view="" 10="">; see also Kip Jones,

meta          | 294
text          | as a form of communication in the social sciences is largely based on the fol-
              | lowing proposals:
              | - Traditional communication in the social sciences is highly specialized. The-
              | ory and research findings are largely unintelligible to audiences untrained
              | within the disciplines. If a scientific text can easily be read by the general
              | public it is typically viewed as “unscientific,” and discounted by gatekeepers
              | in a discipline. Thus, not only do social scientists largely suppress forms of
              | communication that might engage those who are the subject of study, but
              | their work is generally ignored by those whose deliberations affect the fu-
              | ture of the society.
              | - By expanding the possibilities of representation – using theater, art, or
              | multi-media, for example – scientists invite a more fully embodied response
              | from their audiences; performances can more effectively motivate interest
              | and action, and they can enhance dialogues on important societal issues.
              | - All forms of description and explanation provide models for action. In this
              | sense, written forms of social science communication are highly limited in
              | what they offer as models for action. Essentially one exposed to a limited
              | rhetorical style. By expanding the range of communicative possibilities, so
              | do the sciences expand the repertoires for social action. Employing drama or
              | film, for example, not only teaches about a given topic, but it also provides
              | new images for representation and action.
              | - Traditional forms of representation in the sciences are realist in their rheto-
              | ric. They suggest that the discourses in use are reflections (i.e. mirrors) of
              | existing realities. By using performance as one’s mode of communication,
              | these assumptions are undermined. The use of theater, fiction, poetry, or art,
              | for example, suggests their aesthetic nature – that they are created by people
              | and are not “mirrors of nature.” In this way, performative representations are
              | capable of conveying the sense of truth, but simultaneously undermining its
              | grounds. They are not declarations of what is the case, so much as invita-
              | tions to “consider this way of seeing the world.” Challenged are the distinc-
              | tions between science/art, serious/play, and truth/imagination.
              | - Traditional forms of scientific writing radically truncate the potentials of the
              | language. Typically they rely on declarative prose. A performative orienta-
              | tion invites the writer to explore the full potentials of the medium, including,
              | for example, irony, metaphor, humor, and more. While traditional writing
              | seeks to bring the full content into a logically coherent whole, a performa-
              | tive orientation invites explorations into ambiguity, subtle nuance, and con-
              | tradiction.
              | - Traditional communication practices in the sciences suppress or disregard
              | the value investments and implications of the research in question. They
              | sustain the misleading presumption of value-free research. Performative
              | modes of communication typically make apparent the investments and im-
              | plications of one’s work. They often rely on dramatic tension to carry their
meta          | 295
text          | message, demonstrating that the scientist deeply cares about an issue and
              | wishes to share these concerns with others.
              | - When used in academic settings – for example, the lecture hall or profes-
              | sional journal – performatively orientated work challenges the traditions that
              | have defined these locations as “truth zones,” that is locations honoring the
              | expression of those who possess the truth. The sciences thus become more
              | opened for the inclusion of multiple traditions, and thus they become more
              | polyvocal, dialogic, and democratic.
              | - Performative social science allows for close collaborations among various
              | disciplinary fields, from the humanities and the arts, as well as the other sci-
              | ences (Jones, 2006).
              | 3. Current Conditions and Future Potentials
              | Although drawing from a rich history, the performative social sciences are in a
              | fledgling state of development. At the same time, the number of journals fea-
              | turing qualitative research has rapidly expanded; see for example, The Journal
              | of Qualitative Inquiry, Qualitative Research in Psychology, Text and Perform-
              | ance Quarterly, International Review of Qualitative Research, and the on-line
              | journals, FQS, International Journal of Qualitative Methods, Qualitative Soci-
              | ology Review, and The Qualitative Report. All these journals discuss or feature
              | experimental writing, poetry, visual images, dramatic scripts, and other forms
              | of performative expression. Further, the Centre for Qualitative Research at the
              | School of Health and Social Care at Bournemouth University, UK, offers
              | graduate study with a performance component. Also a listserv related to per-
              | formative social science is available through a Sage Publications website.
              | Both the enthusiasm for performative work and its contribution to social sci-
              | ence deliberations are substantial. There is also ample reason for optimism in
              | terms of the future of such efforts. This is not only the case in terms of the
              | present burgeoning of qualitative research across the social sciences, but as
              | well in terms of the opportunity that such research represents for the fledgling
              | scholar. Performative inquiry, as we have seen, invites the scholar to engage
              | with issues that have significant personal value. Thus, rather than being forced
              | by the profession to join dialogues the parameters of which are already fixed,
              | the performative domain invites the scholar into passionate inquiry. Further, the
              | domain invites scholars to use communicative skills (e.g., in music, art, theater,
              | dance) that have otherwise been excluded from their professional life.
              | This is not to say that the future of such work is unproblematic. Of all the
              | developments in qualitative inquiry, performative practices are the most radi-
              | cal. This is so because, unlike most qualitative practices, they challenge the
              | identity of the discipline. By blurring the boundary between science and art,
              | fact and fiction, seriousness and play, they challenge “normal science” activi-
              | ties and standards. And, within the domain of the performative there remain
meta          | 296
text          | important questions. Three of these are prominent. First, there are difficulties in
              | judging the quality or merit of performatively oriented work. Traditional stan-
              | dards for evaluating research (e.g., validity and reliability, statistical sophistica-
              | tion) are not applicable, and new and more ambiguous criteria must be consid-
              | ered. Standards, such as cultural significance, communicative power, and
              | aesthetic value, for example, are all subject to debate. To illustrate this chal-
              | lenge, a recent PhD dissertation from the University of Bournemouth (Zoë
              | Fitzgerald Poole, 2008) was encased in a wooden box, inscribed with a brass
              | nameplate, in which were placed two books, each page illustrated in colorful
              | graphics, denoting the outcomes of interviews, synthesized by the author, into a
              | poetic form. Also included in the box were DVDs with visual and auditory
              | expositions of the interview materials. As appreciative gifts to the readers, the
              | box contained music, a mermaid figurine, a large doll representing a stuffy old-
              | fashioned professor, chocolates, and hundreds of tiny wrapped up scrolls each
              | with a saying inscribed with elegant calligraphy. There was a map to describe
              | how to take in this collection, which had all been organized into small wooden
              | sections of the box. The dissertation oral, itself, proved to be somewhat contro-
              | versial as questions arose about the scientific merits of the research process and
              | the representations of the results.
              | The second issue is that of the accumulation of knowledge and the progress
              | of the discipline. Traditional social science prized itself on these capacities.
              | Performative approaches are less committed to these goals, but more invested
              | in the meaningfulness of the research, and the ethical issues related to the re-
              | search process itself (Keen & Tordes, 2007). In the case of performative in-
              | quiry, there may be accumulation in terms of communicative efficacy, but an
              | investment in increments in knowledge and disciplinary progress is typically
              | replaced by a concern with making an immediate impact of cultural signifi-
              | cance. Performatively oriented scholars note that because patterns of social life
              | are continuously transforming, the emphasis on accumulation is misleading.
              | The social sciences acquire their significance not from attempting to predict the
              | future from observations of the past, but from entering into those deliberations
              | that create the future.
