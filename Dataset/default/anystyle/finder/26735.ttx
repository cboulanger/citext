              | Abstract
              | In this paper I address, in a preliminary way, a problem of political theory
              | that, while not new, has been brought home with special urgency by recent
              | events. The problem is the predicament created by the imperative of coming
              | to terms with the subject of political possibility and the concomitant
              | difficulty of doing so. The argument of this paper is circuitous. I first argue
              | that grappling with the subject of political possibility requires that we
              | examine the intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. I draw a
              | crucial distinction between the ways that the ability to calculate
              | probabilities and to entertain possibilities enters into social and political
              | interaction. I than identify the mechanisms – attention and imagination – at
              | work in the ways symbolic forms govern our ability to envision possibilities. I
              | show how political possibility is implicated with power. And I sketch some
              | of the constraints and vicissitudes that make the politics of possibility a
              | precarious enterprise. I conclude by briefly connecting my preceding
              | analysis to the theme of antipolitics.

              | I.
              | In this paper I address a problem of political theory that, while not new, has
              | been brought home with special urgency by recent events. The problem is
              | the predicament created by the imperative of coming to terms with the
              | subject of political possibility and the concomitant difficulty of doing so
              | (Dunn 1980, 267,260). In the face of this quandary I pursue a basic intuition:
              | in order to properly conceptualize political possibility we must recognize
              | and analyze the intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. In other
              | words, in order to better understand the notion of political possibility we
              | must properly grasp its cultural dimensions. An example will perhaps lend
              | some, at least initial, plausibility to this intuition.
              | The example is drawn from an interview, conducted in October 1982,
              | with Bogdan Borusewisz, a Solidarity activist and underground leader. Early
              | in the interview he harshly criticized the stance adopted by some Solidarity
              | leaders during the period leading up to December 1981 when the Polish
              | regime imposed marshal law.
              | “There came a point when democratically elected activists lost all
              | contact with reality. And reality was more than Solidarity, more than
              | radical leaflets, and Radio Free Europe; it was the USSR, the army,
              | and the security service, which we already knew in the autumn of 1980
              | had drawn up a list of people to be interned (Lopinski, Moskit and
              | Wilk, 1990, 8).”
              | In other words, Borusewisz was no wild utopian, intent on holding out
              | fantastic alternatives. He was aware that political reality and possibility are,
              | in crucial ways, distinguished by material considerations.
              | In the same interview, however, Borusewisz reflects on the reasons
              | why, during the days immediately after the regime imposed martial law, he
              | and others thought it imperative to sustain the strike at the Lenin shipyard.
              | “After all we had to defend a symbol; it wasn’t a question of the
              | Gdansk shipyard or the Repair Yard or even Gdansk itself but of
              | Poland as a whole. If we’d managed to draw out the strike in the
              | shipyard it might have been possible to hold back the authorities on all
              | fronts. On the other hand, I was certain that if the strike at the
              | shipyard collapsed, the fact that a coal mine or steel works was on
              | strike wouldn’t have made any difference, because people think in
              | terms of symbols and would hang on as long as the shipyard hung on.
              | That is why I tried desperately to defend the shipyard (Lopinski, Moskit
              | and Wilk 1990, 30–31).”
              | As this passage makes clear, Borusewisz and others recognized that, over
              | a decade or so, Poles invested the Gdansk shipyard with special
              | significance. They had transformed the shipyard into a symbol, one that
              | enabled opponents of the regime to sustain an alternative vision of ‘Poland
              | as a whole.’1 Consequently, it became a focal point in the strategic struggle
              | between the opposition and the regime. Unlike strikes elsewhere, the one at
              | the shipyard, according to Borusewisz, symbolized the possibility, however
              | fleeting, that Poles might resist marshal law. Ultimately, Solidarity could not
              | 1 I take Solidarity to be a paradigmatic antipolitical movement (Ost 1990). The shipyard is
              | among the central symbols in the “tradition of resistance” that Polish workers first
              | constructed and then extended to other portions of society (Laba 1991).

              | sustain the strike at the shipyard. And although other strikes continued, the
              | collapse of the strike there rendered the possibility of widespread, overt
              | resistance inconceivable.
              | This example is intended to suggest how intimately connected symbol and
              | strategy are in social and political life, and how they are related in ways that
              | directly effect our capacity to envision political possibilities. My aim in this
              | paper is to explore, and hopefully clarify, these claims in a preliminary way.
              | The remainder of the paper consists of six sections. In sections two
              | and three I draw and hopefully make clear a crucial distinction between the
              | ways that the ability to calculate probabilities and to entertain possibilities
              | enter into social and political interaction. And I argue that the latter capacity
              | is governed by the force of prevailing symbolic forms. In section four I
              | identify the mechanisms at work in the ways symbolic forms govern our
              | ability to envision possibilities. In section five I address the ways that
              | political possibility is implicated with power. In section six I sketch some of
              | the constraints and vicissitudes that render the politics of possibility a
              | difficult and precarious undertaking. In section seven I briefly connect my
              | argument to the theme of antipolitics.
              | II.
              | “What is politically possible depends in part on what men believe” (Dunn
              | 1980, 260).2 This is no doubt so. But it also is too quick. I put to one side
              | for the moment matters of material or physical constraint. In this section I
              | argue that the scope of political possibility is, in the most basic,
              | theoretically important sense constituted not by beliefs or expectations per
              | se, but by the range of things (e.g., actors, events, outcomes) concerning
              | which relevant agents can hold beliefs or establish expectations. Here
              | again, perhaps an example will help.
              | In his Antipolitics, a book largely devoted to envisioning a possible
              | post-Yalta political framework, George Konrad reflected on, among other
              | things, the prevailing uncoordinated, largely individualistic strategy of
              | opposition in Hungary. He explained that:
              | “We Hungarians never created our own KOR or Solidarity, because we
              | didn’t really believe that communist power could be reconciled with
              | democratic institutions born of society’s aspirations of self-
              | determination. We saw what our Polish friends were doing; we wanted
              | them to succeed, but doubted that they could (Konrad 1984, 129–30).”
              | This is a straightforward estimation of probabilities. Oppositional elements
              | in Hungary, according to Konrad, had no difficulty envisioning collective
              | political strategies such as those adopted by KOR or Solidarity. They
              | simply believed that such strategies held out a very low probability of
              | success.
              | Consider, by contrast, the emergence of radically unanticipated actors
              | onto the political stage. When I say that such actors are radically
              | unanticipated I mean that ex ante their appearance as political actors was
              | not just unforeseen but unforeseeable. Here we might include, for instance,
              | the way that the British working classes intruded into politics under the
              | aegis of Chartism in the late 1830’s. Or, more recently, and perhaps of
              | 2 Dunn himself is concerned with grounding the notion of political obligation in a general
              | conception of what in different times and places is political possible. He does not
              | systematically explore the notion of political possibility.

              | greater relevance to the topic of antipolitics, we might we might include the
              | way mothers infiltrated Argentine politics in the late 1970’s. In such
              | instances the very incongruity of such actors engaging in politics – as
              | workers, or as mothers – scrambles established political categories and,
              | thereby redefines the realm of possibility.3 In the latter case, for a period of
              | time this incongruity prevented the Argentine Junta from recognizing the
              | Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo as political actors in any relevant sense.
              | Within the political categories to which the junta, like the rest of Argentine
              | society, subscribed, “mothers were not perceived as political subjects.” The
              | Mothers of the Plaza, as a result, were enshrouded by a “political
              | invisibility” that afforded them a strategically crucial, if temporary, advantage
              | over the junta.4 This was a matter not of probability but of possibility or, for
              | lack of a better word, worldview. During the early months of the Mother’s
              | weekly demonstrations in the Plaza de Mayo, the junta literally did not
              | understand the political nature of the protests. Such activity transgressed
              | the boundaries of their political world. It simply was not possible for mothers
              | to engage in politics.5 By the time the junta reconfigured their conception of
              | political possibility so that they could recognize the Mothers as political
              | actors, and take repressive measures, it was too late. The Mothers of the
              | Plaza already had come to symbolize, both domestically and in the
              | international arena, the possibility of open resistance to the Argentine
              | regime.
              | A worldview amounts to a basic understanding of how the world
              | operates, of the sorts of entities (actors, events, outcomes) it contains.
              | Among the components of a worldview is a more or less systematic “folk
              | psychology,” a general conception of persons and a corresponding set of
              | expectations about how they typically behave.6 In the present paper I focus
              | exclusively on this dimension of political possibility – the types of political
              | subject that relevant actors can hold beliefs or develop expectations about.
              | III.
              | It is important to distinguish, then, between the different ways that the
              | calculation of probabilities and the consideration of possibilities inform
              | political action.7 And it is important to see how the latter trades upon the
              | 3 Dorothy Thompson (1984, 11–12) captures the in congruity of workers entering the
              | political of early nineteenth century Britain in the following way. “In the 1830’s the good
              | self-respecting workman did not mix in politics. ... When HM Inspector of Prisons interviewed
              | the men in prison for Chartist activ ities in 1840, he spoke approvingly of the decision some
              | had made to ‘give up politics.’ It did not occur to him that former Chartists should become
              | Whigs or Tories. Politics in any form was not the business of the working man.”
              | 4 I draw the quoted phrases from Navarro (1989, 257).
              | 5 Hence the practice of the junta of referring to the Mothers as the “madwomen” of the
              | Plaza.
              | 6 On this point see generally Geertz (1983, 55–70) and Bruner (1990, 13–14,35,42–
              | 3,47,52).
              | 7 “There is a fundamental difference between a situation in which a decision maker is
              | uncertain about the state of X and a situation in which the decision maker has not given any
              | thought to whether X matters or not, between a situation in which a prethought event judged
              | of low probability occurs and a situation in which something occurs that has never been
              | thought about, between judging an action unlikely to succeed and never thinking about an
              | action. The latter situations in each pair are not adequately modeled in terms of low
              | probabilities” (Nelson and Winter, 1982, 67).

              | intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. All of this will perhaps
              | emerge more clearly if we examine attempts to depict the world solely in
              | terms of the calculation of probabilities.
              | Consider, in this respect, the austere, counterfactual world that
              | rational choice theorists construct. Samuel Popkin’s The Rational Peasant
              | supplies a particularly instructive example. Early on, Popkin proclaims that
              | he will advance an exclusively rational choice analysis of Vietnamese
              | peasant politics and that, in so doing, he will treat cultural considerations
              | as “givens” (Popkin 1979, 82). He aims to explain peasant politics solely in
              | terms of the peasants’ self-interest and their estimates of the likelihood that
              | those interests can be realized. Toward the end of the book, however,
              | Popkin reflects briefly on the decisive role that he attributes to “political
              | entrepreneurs” in facilitating collective action among peasants (Popkin
              | 1979, 259–66). He suggests that the success or failure of these leaders
              | depended crucially on their competence and credibility. But, somewhat
              | surprisingly, Popkin insists that their credibility derived from “cultural
              | bases.” He attributes the variable success of religious and political
              | entrepreneurs over time to their differential ability “to utilize cultural themes”,
              | to orchestrate “terms and symbols,” that resonated with their potential
              | constituents (Popkin, 1979, 260–61). In short, political entrepreneurs
              | engender and sustain credibility through symbolic action. They seek to
              | coordinate and mobilize relevant constituencies by more or less skillfully
              | deploying symbolic forms that have force over them.
              | I will return to Popkin shortly. But now consider a second theoretical
              | example, one much closer to the “core” of the rational choice research
              | tradition. Here I have in mind the ways that, like Popkin, non-cooperative
              | game theorists tacitly incorporate symbolic considerations into their
              | purportedly purely strategic models. For present purposes I will consider
              | only one of the ways they do so.8
              | Game theorists tacitly incorporate symbolic force into their standard
              | procedure for transforming games of incomplete information into equivalent
              | but technically more tractable games of complete but imperfect information.
              | This procedure is complex.9 Simply put, it reduces, for analytical purposes,
              | all forms of uncertainty to mutual uncertainty about the payoff functions
              | characteristic of players in the game. All players in the game then construct
              | conditional probabilities over the “types” of other player that they might
              | encounter based on an initial objective distribution that game theorists
              | typically attribute to “nature.”
              | Symbol and strategy intersect here because, as game theorists
              | typically do not recognize, “types” are not natural categories.
              | “The everyday world in which members of any community move, their
              | taken for granted field of social action, is populated not by anybodies,
              | faceless men without qualities, but by somebodies, concrete classes
              | of determinant persons positively characterized and appropriately
              | labeled. And the symbol systems which define these classes are not
              | given in the nature of things – they are historically constructed,
              | socially maintained and individually applied (Geertz 1973, 363–64).”
              | 8 A more obvious example is the way that Schelling (1960) invokes the “symbolic contents
              | of the game” in order to explain how problems of multiple equilibria are resolved in strategic
              | settings. This remains the standard resolution t o this endemic problem even among more
              | highly technical game theorists (Kreps 1990, 101; Myerson 1992).

              | The range of possible “types” in any population is marked and interpreted
              | symbolically. Thus, for example, recalling the revolutionary events of Paris
              | in 1848, Tocqueville reports repeated encounters with “workers,” whom he
              | readily identifies by their “blouses, which, as we all know, are their fighting
              | as well as their working clothes” (Tocqueville 1987, 142 stress added).10
              | Here clothing operates as a symbolic marker, allowing Tocqueville to
              | recognize the types of actors he encounters and, thereby, to navigate
              | perilous, highly indeterminant political circumstances.
              | Return now to Popkin. On his account, the political entrepreneurs who
              | sought to coordinate the collective action among the Vietnamese peasantry
              | encountered the daunting prior problem of projecting comprehensible,
              | credible “visions of the future” (Popkin 1988, 61–62; 1979, 261). This
              | required that they recast a political world populated by “rational peasants”
              | into one in which other “types” – specifically credible, committed
              | entrepreneurs – were genuinely possible. And it required articulating this
              | possibility in “terms and symbols” that had force for relevant constituencies.
              | Popkin argues that Communist organizers did not enjoy success
              | comparable to that of religious leaders until they learned to articulate their
              | vision of the future in indigenous cultural idioms. Prior to that point
              | “[p]easants did not understand why organizers were offering to help them
              | and were reluctant to join with them for even small local projects” (Popkin
              | 1988, 62 stress added; 1979, 261). Their world was symbolically
              | constituted in such a way that it could not accommodate the entrepreneurs’
              | “type” as a genuine possibility. It thereby foreclosed the very possibility of
              | cooperative collective action.

              | Consider the following remark that Jürgen Habermas once made in the
              | course of a discussion of utopia.

              | undertook something of a reconnaissance mission through the streets of Paris. He relates one

              | passed several half-constructed barricades without obstruction, he was halted at the last one;
              | the workers building it, seeing a fine gentleman in a black suit with clean white linen quietly
              | walking around the dirty streets by the Hotel de Ville and stopping in front of them with a
              | placid air of curiosity, decided to make some use of this suspicious onlooker. They asked him
              | in the name of fraternity to help them in their work. Corcelle ... in the circumstances ...
              | rightly thought it best to yield without a fuss. So there he was levering up the pavement and
              | putting the stones on top of one another as tidily as he could. His natural clumsiness and his
              | wandering thoughts luckily came to his aid, and he was soon dismissed as a useless laborer”
              | (Tocqueville 1987, 139 stress added).

              | I agree. In fact, I would suggest that this remark is relevant not just to
              | remarkable episodes, but, to political action and interaction more generally.
              | Habermas, nonetheless leaves open at least two especially pressing
              | sets of theoretical questions. First, if as Bogdan Borusewisz noted in my
              | initial example, ‘people think in terms of symbols,’ how are we to
              | understand this process. In other words, why do political actors, whether
              | individual or collective, indeed fight “with” symbols? What sort of force do
              | symbols have that make them effective resources in political struggle? And,
              | second, how are we to understand the dynamics of such symbolic
              | contests? How do we specify the character of symbolic action? I address
              | the first set of question in this section and the second set in the next
              | section.
              | Cultures consist of intersubjectively shared symbols which actors
              | invest with meaning and deploy in ritual, tradition and other cultural
              | performances. It is a sort of “symbolic strategy for encompassing
              | situations,” for imposing conceptual order on otherwise indeterminant
              | processes of interaction (Geertz 1973, 250,230,89; Ortner 1984, 129).11
              | On this view: “Symbols instigate social action” (Turner 1974, 55). However,
              | they do so, as I now argue, only indirectly. To see why, it is necessary to
              | understand how symbols work. This, in turn, requires that we distinguish for
              | analytical purposes the “scope” of symbolic forms from their “force.”
              | The scope of a symbol or cultural performance refers to “the range of
              | social contexts within which” relevant actors regard it “as having more or
              | less direct relevance.” Its force refers to its “centrality or marginality” in the
              | lives of relevant actors, to the “psychological grip” it exercises over them
              | (Geertz, 1968, 111–113). The efficacy of a set of symbolic forms clearly
              | depends on the scope that actors attribute to it. This accounts for the
              | propensity of oppositional social and political movements, for example, to
              | generate elaborate, encompassing “alternative cultures.”12 Yet force takes
              | analytical priority over scope. Any claim regarding the scope of a particular
              | symbol or practice presupposes that it has force. Absent such force it
              | wouldn’t be relevant to any social context.
              | The force of symbolic forms is at bottom cognitive or conceptual
              | (Lukes 1977, 68f). Symbolic forms, orchestrated in cultural performances of
              | various sorts, “structure the way people think about social life” (Moore and
              | Myerhoff 1977, 4).13 They serve as “extrinsic sources of information”
              | (Geertz 1973, 92) not in the sense that they convey detailed messages, but
              | in a broader sense of imparting a view of how the world actually is – how it
              | operates and how individuals can be expected to act within it. Symbolic
              | 11 On this view, culture consists of “a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic
              | forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate and develop their knowledge about
              | and attitudes toward life.” And a symbol is “any object, act, event, quality, or relation which
              | serves as a vehicle for a conception – the conception being the symbol’s ‘meaning’ ” (Geertz
              | 1973, 89,91,10). On the career of this concept of culture see Ortner (1984) and Barth (1989).
              | 12 This was true, for example, of British Chartists in the 1830’s and 1840’s, of American
              | populism in the 1890’s, of the turn of the century German labor movement, and of Italian
              | Communists in the 1970’s.
              | 13 This obviously presumes something about the way we think. But it does not entail
              | psychological reductionism. Rather, it presumes an “extrinsic theory” of mind in which diverse
              | human mental functions – cognition, emotions, dispositions, etc. – all essentially depend upon
              | the availability of sets of symbolic forms (Geertz 1973, 215,45–6,76f,360f). Thus, as
              | psychologist Jerome Bruner (1986, 15) contends, “a cultural tool kit – a set of prosthetic
              | devices, so to speak” is essential to the full flourishing of “human mental activity.” See also

              | forms, then, do not directly instill beliefs or values. Rather, they establish
              | the focal categories of social and political interaction and, thereby, establish
              | parameters on belief formation. Symbolic forms help delineate – in at least
              | two empirically intertwined but analytically distinguishable ways – the realm
              | of social and political possibility for relevant actors.
              | In the first place, symbolic forms operate indicatively to focus the
              | attention of actors, directing it toward certain ranges of alternatives and
              | away from others.14 They assert order, relation and predictability in the face
              | of indeterminacy (Moore and Myerhoff, 1977, 18). They foreclose
              | possibilities. This process is not naive. Symbolic force discriminates. By
              | calling attention to certain options, thereby defining them as viable or
              | feasible, it forecloses other options. It constitutes social and political
              | interactions on particular, partial terms (Lukes 1977, 68–9; Elkins and
              | Simeon 1979, 128; Kertzer 1988, 87).
              | If symbolic forms only operated indicatively they would have an
              | unvaryingly constraining, conservative impact on social and political
              | interaction. But symbols also operate subjunctively to disclose possibilities
              | often not immediately discernable in mundane existence. They thus open
              | options that might go otherwise unconsidered (Bruner 1986, 26,159; Turner
              | 1987, 26–7,41–42,101). Orchestrated in cultural performances such as
              | ritual, for example, symbolic forms give palpable existence to as yet
              | unrealized possibility.15 They nourish the imagination of social and political
              | actors, helping to “render the world less fixed, less banal, more susceptible
              | to recreation” (Bruner, 1986, 159). Thus, this process is not naive either. By
              | imaginatively disclosing and exploring possibilities actors can, within limits,
              | redefine their options.
              | Symbolic forms, then, exert force over social and political actors by
              | commanding their attention and capturing their imagination. They govern the
              | mental capacities with which actors delimit the possibilities embodied in
              | their extant situation and envision those that lie beyond it. So understood,
              | the force of symbolic forms grounds the intimate relation between symbol
              | and strategy in politics.
              | V.
              | Symbolic forms govern prevailing conceptions of possibility. They are, in
              | Charles Taylor (1985) terms, “constitutive” of practices and institutions.
              | This, however, leaves us on an ambiguous theoretical terrain. On the one
              | hand, possibility is not defined purely by structural causes.16 The notion of
              | political possibility, in particular, presumes that actors intentionally and
              | deliberately endeavor to constitute the world in particular ways (Elster 1978,
              | 48–49). On the other hand, constituting or reconstituting the social and
              | political world, disclosing or foreclosing possibilities, does not involve
              | selecting or rejecting discrete, pre-defined alternatives. It is not, strictly
              | 14 Stinchcombe suggests that attention is “the key link between individuals and cultural
              | systems.” The force of symbolic forms on his view resides in part in their capacity to establish
              | “attention structures” that provide common foci of choice and interaction (Stinchcombe
              | 1968, 247,235–36). Thus, as Elkins and Simeon (1979, 142,127–28,131,139) put the point:
              | “Culture is unlikely to be of much help in explaining why alternative A was chosen over
              | alternative B – but it may be of great help in understanding why A and B were considered,
              | while no thought was given to C, D, or E.”
              | 15 “In ritual,” for example, “the world as lived and the world as imagined, fused under the
              | agency of a single set of symbolic forms, turn out to be the same world” (Geertz, 1973, 112).
              | 16 Even if it obviously is subject to physical and material constraints (Follesdal 1981).

              | speaking, a matter of choice (Follesdal 1981, 402). Rather, it is a matter of
              | the ways political actors seek, for strategic purposes, to exploit the force
              | that symbolic forms hold for relevant constituencies. How are we to
              | understand the character of such symbolic action?
              | In the first place, symbolic action consists largely in the efforts to
              | invest a symbolic form or cultural performance with particular, partial
              | meaning. Relevant constituencies share symbols and the cultural
              | performances in which they are orchestrated insofar as they mutually
              | attribute significance to that set. However, the meanings that individuals or
              | groups within the population attribute to the symbolic components of their
              | culture need not be shared. Symbolic forms, not the imperfectly shared,
              | occasionally idiosyncratic, frequently contested meanings attributed to
              | them, constitute the crucial intersubjective, public dimension of culture.
              | Meanings can be shared, more or less imperfectly, within a population
              | or they can verge on the idiosyncratic. Indeed political acumen is properly
              | conceived less as the capacity to invent new symbols than as the ability to
              | creatively recast meanings invested in existing symbolic forms (Walzer
              | 1967, 196). Anyone attempting such semantic improvisation necessarily will
              | challenge the established meanings attributed to a symbol. And they quite
              | possibly will confront discordant improvisations crafted by others. Symbolic
              | forms do not simply express meaning. They enable social and political
              | actors to make, remake and, in the process, contest meanings (Cohen
              | 1985, 15).17
              | Second, as should now be clear, symbolic action is conflictual. Tocqueville
              | brings this point home with especial force in one well known episode that he
              | recounts in his Recollections. There he recalls as follows the opening in
              | early May 1848 of the new Constituent Assembly to which he was an
              | elected delegate.
              | “I should be able to call to mind the look of that Assembly at its
              | opening, but I find that my recollection is very blurred. . . . I can
              | remember only our shouting “Long Live the Republic!” fifteen times in
              | the course of the session in competition with one another. . . . I think
              | that cry was sincere on both sides, but it stood for different, even
              | contradictory thoughts. Everybody wanted to preserve the Republic,
              | but some wanted to use it for attack, and others to defend themselves
              | (Tocqueville, 1987, p. 99).”
              | Tocqueville was not a disinterested observer of this scene. Despite his
              | partisanship he grants that the political factions contesting the meaning of
              | ‘the Republic’ were sincere.18 Delegates of the contending parties were not
              | duplicitous; they actually interpreted ‘the Republic’ and the possibilities
              | embodied in the political world in different, conflicting ways.
              | 17 This line of argument has a contentious implication. It suggests that we shift theoretical
              | attention away from a Durkheimian inspired preoccupation with culture as a medium of
              | integration and instead think of symbolic forms as devices for aggregating meanings (Cohen,
              | 1985, 20,21). Cultural symbols do not express value consensus or shared belief (Laitin 1988).
              | Indeed, symbolic forms do not so much represent or express pre-existing values and beliefs as
              | constitute the context within which individuals formulate beliefs and values. They help
              | structure belief (Cohen 1979, 98; Kertzer 1988, 68).
              | 18 On republican symbolism during this period in France see Agulhon (1981).

              | Contests of this sort are essentially strategic, part of what Geertz
              | (1973, 316) calls “the struggle for the real.”19 Actors engaged in such
              | strategic contests seek, with differential facility and success, to exploit
              | symbolic force in order to define the context of their ongoing interactions.
              | Their objective is to establish as authoritative a particular and partial
              | conception of the world and the social and political possibilities it contains.
              | In the struggle for the real actors strive to command the attention and
              | capture the imagination of relevant others by directing the symbolic media
              | with which they think.
              | Third, the struggle for the real is pervasive and inescapable. It takes
              | place across a range of arenas. For example, delegates who Tocqueville
              | describes mounted their struggle at center stage, publicly contesting the
              | range of possibilities contained in ‘the Republic’. By contrast, peasants
              | engaging in everyday forms of resistance are effective precisely because
              | they do not assail the public stage. They “typically avoid any direct
              | symbolic confrontation with authority.” At a more mundane, local level,
              | however, they too are engaged in a contest of interpretations, “a struggle
              | over the appropriation of symbols . . . over how the past and present should
              | be understood and labeled” (Scott 1985, xvi, xvii, 27, 178).
              | The struggle for the real is inescapable, it is not a contingent aspect of
              | symbolic action. Actors have both the occasion and an incentive to take
              | part. Cultures afford ample opportunity for symbolic contests. Because they
              | are, by definition, multivocal, symbolic forms obviously invite discordant
              | interpretation. Moreover, “cultural systems” are not seamless.20 The
              | interstices that they inevitably contain provide openings for semantic
              | improvisation. Symbolic forms also establish a powerful incentive to engage
              | in the struggle for the real. They do not influence thought or action
              | deterministically by directly instilling individual values, beliefs or
              | preferences.21 Symbolic force does however circumscribe the range of
              | possibilities over which actors might establish values, preferences, or
              | beliefs. Moreover, symbolic force discriminates. It can focus attention on
              | certain options thereby diverting attention from others and circumscribing
              | possibility. It also can slacken the constraints of attention by sustaining
              | unrealized options in imagination. In this way it can hold out as viable or
              | feasible options that otherwise would not enter into consideration. In these
              | ways symbolic force sustains particular conceptions of political possibility
              | at the expense of others.22
              | The struggle for the real occupies the nexus of symbol and strategy.
              | What is at stake in this struggle are political possibilities and the symbolic
              | forms that govern how actors entertain them. The struggle for the real, then,
              | 19 When speaking of symbolic action anthropologists regularly use metaphors of
              | “management”, “strategy ”, “bargaining” and “negotiation.” For examples and discussion see
              | Johnson (1991). Metaphors are not merely literary embellishments. They structure social and
              | political inquiry. The metaphors that interpretive theorists deploy provide warrant for
              | pursuing the unexamined strategic dimensions of “symbolic action.”
              | 20 The extent of their internal coherence and interconnectedness is an empirical question
              | (Geertz, 1973, 18,406–407; Turner 1974, 163). It is very important not to prejudge the
              | extent of this internal coherence (Barth 1989).

              | is a struggle over power. In seeing how this is so, we can also identify
              | some of the vicissitudes and constraints to which participants in this
              | struggle are subject.
              | VI.
              | The struggle for the real is a struggle over possibility. It is a struggle for
              | power. More precisely, it is a struggle for power over others, a contest to
              | control the media, the symbols and cultural performances, in terms of which
              | social and political actors conceive possibilities and fashion them into viable
              | alternatives. The intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics pivots
              | around possibility, feasibility and power.
              | Recall that the notion of political possibility presupposes that agents
              | intentionally and deliberately seek to constitute the world in particular ways.
              | Intentional action is the product of “two successive filtering devices” (Elster,
              | 1979, 113, 77). The first filter specifies the “feasible set” by circumscribing
              | the range of abstractly possible alternatives. The feasible set, then,
              | consists of those options genuinely available to actors. The second filter is
              | the process through which actors choose from among the options in the
              | feasible set.
              | Strategic actors regularly contest the context of their interactions –
              | including the prevailing set of feasible options that it makes available
              | (Schelling 1960). Moreover, what often is at stake in such contests are the
              | symbolic media through which others envision possibilities and identify
              | some subset of conceivable options as feasible.
              | “After all, options are not just opened or closed. They are essentially
              | seen to be open or closed, and crucially seen so under particular
              | descriptions, descriptions that can themselves motivate or inhibit
              | action. . . . What one cannot envisage is difficult to choose (Rorty,
              | 1988, 337–38).”
              | In any situation the “feasible” as distinct from “merely conceivable” options
              | are a function of what actors consider “obvious,” what they “take for granted”
              | and there is no general criterion for differentiating genuinely feasible from
              | abstractly possible options (Schwartz 1986, 224–228). The way this
              | distinction is drawn in particular settings is a question of power.
              | Power is a relational concept. When agents exercise power they
              | necessarily exercise it over others. In particular, they aim to define the set
              | of feasible options that others consider when determining how to act.23
              | Thus, power differs from persuasion which aims to modify how others
              | evaluate alternatives. It does not directly alter another’s preferences or
              | beliefs regarding available options. Similarly, power differs from force which
              | aims to eliminate choice on the part of those subjected to it by physically
              | narrowing their feasible set to a single option. Power need not involve
              | physical constraint. It aims to influence the way others to choose a
              | particular course of action by modifying the alternatives available to them.
              | Power can work by altering the incentive structure that actors face. It
              | consists, in such instances, of negative or positive inducements, threats or
              | offers. But power need not involve such inducements at all. Indeed, actors
              | can exercise power in strategic situations simply by credibly leading others
              | to expect that they will choose a particular course of action (Taylor 1982,
              | 23 The discussion in this paragraph is indebted to the typology presented by Taylor (1982,
              | 10–25).

              | 12–13,145). Actors who can successfully coordinate the expectations of a
              | relevant constituency often can generate the sort of collective action needed
              | to sustain selective inducements in the first place (Hardin 1990, 363,366–
              | 69).
              | Coordination, however, is typically as much a matter of expectations
              | as incentives. Strategic actors can mutually coordinate their expectations
              | only by focusing attention on one among a range of alternatives. They must
              | create a “focal point” by endowing that option with prominence and this, in
              | any given instance, typically is a product of “imagination” (Schelling 1960,
              | 58). Strategic actors create focal points through symbolic action. They
              | invest seemingly extra-strategic particularities with significance, thereby
              | transforming them into symbols whose force coordinates social and political
              | interaction.24 They exercise power over others by symbolically structuring
              | their expectations. Power in this sense, operates “along the cognitive
              | dimension” (Lukes 1977, 68; Turner 1974, 134).
              | Power may be malign. “It might be said that the main function of a
              | system of domination is” to foreclose options, “to define what is realistic
              | and what is not realistic and to drive certain goals and aspirations into the
              | realm of the impossible, the realm of idle dreams, of wishful thinking” (Scott
              | 1985, 326). Symbolically constituted attention structures can be highly
              | inhibiting. They foreclose possibilities By defining alternatives to existing
              | arrangements as infeasible such attention structures can prevent
              | subordinate actors from recognizing, much less pursuing a range of
              | possibilities. On the other hand, even oppositional groups need to
              | circumscribe possibilities.25 They rely on attention structures to coordinate
              | their activities and potentially to divert more powerful groups. This is
              | precisely the strategy that the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, for example,
              | adopted when they both occupied the symbolic center of Argentine politics
              | (the Plaza from which they took their name) and did so as mothers.
              | Disclosing possibilities is a similarly equivocal process. Contesting the
              | bounds of political possibility crucially presumes that actors can imagine
              | alternatives precluded by extant definitions of the political world.
              | Subordinate actors are adept at this sort of symbolic action. In particular,
              | they demonstrate a remarkable propensity to symbolically reverse (and
              | thereby expose the conventional character of) prevailing social and political
              | arrangements (Scott 1985, 331). But if such symbolic action is pervasive, it
              | also underscores the observation that “in matters of social constitution the
              | field of possibilities is much wider than the people within each society
              | imagine” (Tocqueville 1987, 76).26 Symbolic reversals often are little more
              | 24 In strategic situations not just incentive structures but “the aesthetic properties, the
              | historical properties, the legal and moral properties, the cultural properties, and all the other
              | suggestive and connotative details, can serve to focus the expectations of certain participants
              | on certain solutions” (Schelling 1960, 113).
              | 25 Circumstances in which “all is possible” are extraordinary. They are fleeting at best. The
              | telling characterization of such circumstances as “moments of madness” (Zolberg 1972)
              | specifies precisely the sorts of conceptual constraint that prevents participants from
              | sustaining them.
              | 26 This sort of constrained imagination is not characteristic solely of symbolic reversals. “At
              | this moment several countries in Eastern Europe . . . have or about to venture into the
              | greatest experiment in history since t he forced Stalinist industrialization of 1929. . . . the
              | economic transformations envisaged in these countries ironically mirror the Communist
              | project. . . . They are radical: They are intended to turn upside down all the existing social
              | relations. And they offer a single panacea, which once waved will cure all ills. Replace
              | ‘nationalization of the means of production’ by ‘private property’ and ‘plan’ by ‘market’ and

              | than that. They do not so much project an alternative set of arrangements
              | as, by reversing existing relations of dependency, inequity or injustice,
              | depict and promote their opposite (Hirschman 1982, 95; Rorty 1988 338).
              | Actors who imaginatively explore unrealized possibilities confront
              | serious hazards even if they manage to transcend this sort of ubiquitous
              | constraint. Most obviously they might intentionally disregard or otherwise
              | neglect pragmatic or material constraints (Follesdal 1981). Thinking back to
              | the example with which I opened the paper, the symbolic power that
              | Solidarity could command was dramatically inadequate in the face of the
              | overwhelming military force that the regime mustered. Thus, in the spring of
              | 1982, one Polish worker lamented: “We’ve got all the symbols, and they’ve
              | got all the guns and tanks.”27 Actors who neglect such material constraints
              | divert energy and resources into “futile exercises,” flights of fancy that at
              | best are compensatory. They encourage fantasy or utopian thinking in the
              | pejorative sense (Rorty 1988, 341).28
              | Political actors face additional risks even where they pursue “genuine”
              | possibilities, alternatives that are viable in the sense of being broadly
              | consonant with pragmatic or material constraints. They might simply fail to
              | realize possible objectives. As with all intentional action, a gap always
              | looms between attempt and accomplishment. Conversely, having realized
              | alternative possibilities, relevant actors might encounter a significant gap
              | between the reality achieved and the possibility held out. Either eventuality
              | can breed disappointment and resignation (Hirschman 1982, 94; Rorty
              | 1988, 338). Either eventuality, may, in that sense, reinforce the sense of
              | inevitability that enshrouds the extant political world.
              | VII.
              | The argument of this paper has been circuitous. I have argued that grappling
              | with the subject of political possibility requires that we examine the intimate
              | relation of symbol and strategy in politics. I have drawn a crucial distinction
              | between the ways that the ability to calculate probabilities and to entertain
              | possibilities enters into social and political interaction. I have identified the
              | mechanisms – attention and imagination – at work in the ways symbolic
              | forms govern our ability to envision possibilities. I have shown how political
              | possibility is implicated with power. And I have sketched some of the
              | constraints and vicissitudes that make the politics of possibility a
              | precarious enterprise. I now want briefly to connect my preceding argument
              | to the theme of antipolitics. I will make three short assertions.
              | 1. Antipolitics, whether conducted by formally organized collective
              | entities like Solidarity or by looser groupings of individuals like the Mothers
              | of the Plaza, is implicated in the politics of possibility. Parties to antipolitics
              | deploy symbolic forms with greater or lesser facility and success and they
              | do so for strategic purposes. They aim to redefine the political world by
              | recasting the bounds of political possibility in particular and partial ways.
              | you can leave the structure of the ideology intact. Perhaps revolutions are shaped by the very
              | systems against which they are directed?” (Przeworski 1991, 7).
              | 27 Reported by Laba (1991, 148).
              | 28 This discussion minimally requires that we differentiate imagination from fantasy.
              | Imagination is concerned with fashioning genuine, viable, if unrealized, alternatives. Fantasy
              | inclines toward the “merely possible,” toward options that, while conceivable, remain
              | “incredible” and consequently unrealizable (Rorty 1988, 340–41; Wittgenstin 1967, para.
              | 275).
meta          | 16

              | 2. Antipolitics, insofar as it is concerned with possibilities, is a strategy in
              | the struggle for power. This may seem peculiar given the aversion of
              | spokesmen like Konrad to power politics. He claims that the “medium of
              | politics is power over people – power backed by weapons” (Konrad 1984,
              | 16). And he asserts that “No thinking person should want to drive others
              | from positions of political power in order to occupy them himself” (Konrad
              | 1984, 119). Yet since antipolitics of the sort in which Solidarity or the
              | Mothers of the Plaza engage entails participation in the “struggle for the
              | real”, this suspicion of power is simply misplaced.29
              | 3. It is easy to find pessimists, those who view the struggle for the real
              | and the efforts to redefine political possibility that it entails as inherently
              | dangerous. But it is not easy to find alternatives. In politics symbol and
              | strategy are related in inescapable ways. So, for example, the invention of
              | traditions is a pervasive strategic move in politics.30 But observers of
              | politics in post-communist East Central Europe typically express suspicion
              | of political actors who invoke tradition (Gyani 1993; Jaworski 1985). They
              | rarely consider whether, in such highly indeterminant political
              | circumstances, it might be possible to invent normatively appealing
              | traditions. I have in mind here, for instance, a tradition of constitutionalism
              | (Johnson 1994). We must, as the brochure for this conference suggests, be
              | wary of antipolitical mobilizations that threaten to derail the emergence or
              | stability of liberal democratic political arrangements. However, the most
              | effective response to such mobilizations is to engage in the politics of
              | possibility. And this means recognizing the need to effectively exercise the
              | power that emerges at the intersection of symbol and strategy.
              | 29 It may be more appropriate to say that Konrad really is opposed to force as a final
              | guarantor of political arrangements. But we should not let his invocation of “spiritual
              | authority” or “moral opposition” (Konrad 1984, 119,122) blind us to the fact that
              | antipolitics is part of the “struggle for the real” and hence is a struggle for power. Both
              | Solidarity and the Mothers of the Plaza invoked spiritual authority in the face of authoritarian
              | rule. But they did so in hopes of expanding the range of political possibilities beyond those
              | sanctioned by extant political arrangements.
              | 30 Compare Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) and Schelling (1960).
