              | Abstract
              | Social support is often described as an exclusively positively acting factor. Its absence is said
              | to mean negative consequences for individuals. This article shows that the supply and
              | dependence of intergenerational social support can have negative consequences and pertains
              | to persisting unequal gender roles and a gendered division of labor in relationships. Based on
              | qualitative interviews, conducted in eastern and western Germany, with young adults (28-30
              | years old) and their parents, we hypothesize, that the bigger supply of intergenerational
              | support of grandparents for their children and grandchildren and an alleged dependence on
              | these transfers is especially responsible for impeding the modernization of traditional role
              | models assigning women to the role as a mother and housewife. However, less availability
              | and dependence on this kind of social support in eastern Germany, contribute to a more
              | flexible form of role allocation in a relationship.

text          | INTRODUCTION
              | Regarding studies of family and gender sociology, Germany is a special case. Its division
              | after WWII induced the establishment of two different social and economic systems. The
              | territory of eastern Germany was the sovereign, socialist state of the German Democratic
              | Republic (GDR), the western German parts formed the sovereign democratic state of the
              | Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), which implemented market economy. After the
              | collapse of the Communist states in 1989/90 the existing political and economic structure of
              | the FRG was superimposed on the territory of the GDR. This is important for studying
              | gender relationships because the FRG and the GDR were different and contrary concerning
              | family regimes, gender relations and state policies towards marriage and fertility (Pfau-
              | Effinger and Geissler 2002; Salles 2006). Even today social science research finds
              | remarkable differences between both regions (Huinink, Kreyenfeld and Trappe 2012; Krause
              | and Ostner 2010), e.g. women from eastern Germany are much younger at their first
              | childbirth, childlessness is less common for them, being unmarried and single mothers are
              | more common (Konietzka and Kreyenfeld 2010). Also differences in the gender-specific
              | division of labor in families are still obvious, but whether underlying gender roles
              | differences have persisted or even intensified after the reunification – or whether
              | equalization between East and West is happening, remains disputed (Kahlert 2010).
              | Explanations for persisting and changing conceptions of gender roles and the division of
              | labor in relationships in eastern and western Germany mostly involve basic political
              | conditions, changes to the labor market and different cultural concepts or socialization
              | experiences. Our article discusses a further factor, which we feel has not been considered
              | sufficiently: the different structure, availability and claiming of intergenerational support.
              | Accordingly, the organization of intergenerational relationships of young adults in their
meta          | 3
text          | reproductive age and how these relationships affect their behavioral roles and partnership
              | arrangements are of our particular interest. We assume, that the bigger supply of
              | intergenerational support of grandparents for their children and grandchildren and an alleged
              | dependence on these transfers in western Germany is especially responsible for the
              | transmission of traditional gender roles. Qualitative interviews with young adults and their
              | parents, which were conducted 2004/5, constitute the basis of our investigation.
              | Next we introduce the different family models in eastern and western Germany and
              | subsequently examine explanatory approaches concerning the emergence and development
              | of these models. Then we explain the theoretical concept of intergenerational exchange
              | processes, identify different types of social support and eventually pose our research
              | question regarding the connection between intergenerational support and reproduction of
              | gender inequalities. Our data and methods are introduced in the empirical section.
              | Subsequently we present summarized results and two case studies from eastern and western
              | Germany.
              | Family Models And Gender Relations In Western And Eastern Germany
              | Concerning family models, the GDR and the FRG exhibited until the 1980s a development
              | which was very homogeneous within the respective state, but in comparison very different.
              | The quasi-standardized family model in former West Germany represented the male
              | breadwinner and the housewife who, after marriage or giving birth to the first child,
              | managed the household and the children and oftentimes did not return to her profession. This
              | model was and is subsidized by the state e.g. by tax benefits (Pfau-Effinger and Smidt 2011).
              | The conception regarding gender roles and actual role behavior changed slowly. Indeed,
meta          | 4
text          | during the cultural revolution of 1968 and coinciding with the emergence of feminist
              | movement in the 1970s/80s (“emancipation from below), “traditional” role patterns were
              | questioned. Growing educational participation of women regarding education, a recent
              | shortage of skilled labor and men increasingly wanting an “active fatherhood” (Werneck,
              | Beham and Palz 2006) led to higher employment of mothers and fathers engaging more in
              | tasks related to care and upbringing (Holst and Schupp 2001; Trappe and Sørensen 2006).
              | Public childcare was and is severely expanding and it is imaginable that sooner or later more
              | gainfully employed mothers may change traditional role models. It is evident at least, in time
              | comparison (1988-2000), that western Germans are progressively attuned against a
              | housewife existence and for part-time employment of mothers of children who go to
              | kindergarten or school (Heß 2010). However, the traditional male breadwinner model proved
              | to be very stable in practice and gender differences continue to persist. Although childless
              | partners are both employed nowadays, the transition to parenthood coincides with a re-
              | traditionalization of gender relations: mothers take care for the child, mostly work part-time
              | and only when their children are older, while fathers remain employed full-time and perform
              | their care and upbringing activities in their leisure (Fthenakis, Kalicki and Peitz 2002; Rüling
              | 2007).
              | In the GDR regulatory actions successfully forced a different family model (“emancipation
              | from above”). Standard was the two-income family, mothers interrupted employment only
              | shortly, part-time work was less common and mothers seeking to reduce working hours
              | experienced more pressure to justify (Falk and Schaeper 2001; Trappe 1995). Accordingly,
              | in 1989 employment of women amounted to 82 percent in the GDR (mostly full-time), but
              | only 56 percent in the FRG (mainly part-time) (Hülser 1996). Though high female labor
              | participation depicts an important aspect of gender-mainstreaming, gender roles still were
meta          | 5
text          | unequal in the GDR and women bore the main responsibility for family and household in
              | addition to gainful employment (Kolinsky 2003; Schmitt and Trappe 2010).
              | Empirical results concerning changed gender roles and family models in eastern Germany
              | since the reunification are inconclusive. In 1994 the non-traditional gender role ideology was
              | most prevalent in eastern Germany based on internationally comparative data (Yodanis
              | 2005). Several current studies find evidence for both sexes still rejecting the western German
              | breadwinner model, and emphasizing the necessity and desire for reconciling work life and
              | motherhood (Author YEAR; Boehnke 2009; Heß 2010; Kreyenfeld and Geisler 2006; Rudd
              | 2000). The share of households with both parents (youngest child younger than 3) working
              | full-time was in 2012 almost four times higher in eastern Germany (18.4 percent) compared
              | to western Germany (4.8 percent; cf. Statistisches Bundesamt 2013a). Comparative studies
              | point to consistent East-West disparities, e.g. attitudes towards gainful employment of
              | mothers, which clearly enjoys a more positive evaluation in eastern Germany (Wenzel
              | 2010). Eastern German men also tend to engage more frequently in childcare and the
              | household (Heß 2010). However, other studies suggest a convergence of eastern German
              | couples to the western German additional income model, a “West-Germanization”
              | respectively (Rosenfeld, Trappe and Gornick 2004; Thelen and Baerwolf 2008).
              | Explanations For Persisting And Changing Gender Roles
              | Literature oftentimes attributes persisting differing conceptions about gender roles and
              | family models to different, durable, cultural overall concepts (Pfau-Effinger and Geissler
              | 2002): Similar to GDR times gainfully employed mothers are natural in eastern Germany
              | and positively valued (Huinink and Konietzka 2003). Contrarily, in western Germany
              | predominates quite a special “myth” of the German mother (Vinken 2001): Motherly
              | childcare is valued ideal, (full-time) employment of mothers is valued negatively and
meta          | 6
text          | considered harmful to the child’s development (Heß 2010). The persistency of the western
              | German family model can still be ascribed to consequent government aid of this model and
              | difficulties practicing other models (e.g. income splitting, insufficient public childcare
              | facilities). The still prevalent East-West disparities, especially concerning the supply of
              | childcare facilities, which was only partially abolished in post-turnaround eastern Germany,
              | may explain another cause for the permanently differing family models and gender roles.
              | The supply of nationwide full-day childcare enabled many eastern German mothers to
              | reconcile homemaking with full-time employment. However, in western Germany access to
              | full-day childcare is less common, especially for children under 3 years. In 2014 27.4
              | percent of western German children younger than 3, compared to 54 percent in eastern
              | Germany, attended a childcare facility or daycare (Statistisches Bundesamt 2014). In eastern
              | Germany comparatively many children younger than 3 enjoy full-day childcare (i.e. 37.3
              | percent; 10.4 percent in western Germany, cf. Statistisches Bundesamt 2013b). It is
              | assumable that these conflicting care systems cause persisting differing gender arrangements
              | in eastern and western Germany.
              | However, observed changes in eastern Germany suggest in some areas an approximation to
              | the modernized western German family model (Heß 2010; Thelen and Baerwolf 2008). This
              | does not necessarily indicate a change of attitudes, but may also be attributed to the
              | worsening of employment opportunities for eastern German mothers (Giesecke and
              | Verwiebe 2010).
              | Western Germany also displays an interesting change which could affect family models and
              | gender roles. Recently the number of childcare facilities, especially for under three-year-
              | olds, has increased drastically and this extension is supposed to continue. Parents’ initiatives
              | have also inspired the foundation of facilities offering more flexible childcare. Regarding the
meta          | 7
text          | change in federal family policy Ilona Ostner (2006) speaks about an approximation of the
              | West to the East. This could set the course for an increase of two-income parents and a
              | change towards more egalitarian gender roles in western Germany (Heß 2010).
              | Changes on the labor market offer another explanation for increased employment of mothers
              | in western Germany. The disappearance of “normal” employment and increase of precarious
              | occupations is impeding men to solely fulfill the role as breadwinner. Thus traditional gender
              | roles and family models are also unhinged due to the plain economic necessity of women
              | participating in gainful employment (Kahlert 2007).
              | Additionally to these explanations we would like to examine persistence and processes of
              | change from a perspective of an, in our opinion, hitherto neglected structural category:
              | whether and in which way gender roles and family models are negotiated, passed on or
              | modernized via intergenerational interactions within the family. Our thoughts base on a
              | relational perspective of human action:
              | “Actors do not behave or decide as atoms outside a social context, nor do they
              | adhere slavishly to a script written for them by the particular intersection of
              | social categories that they happen to occupy. Their attempts at purposive
              | action are instead embedded in concrete, ongoing systems of social relations.”
              | (Granovetter 1985: 487)
              | Intergenerational interactions are an important part of everyday interactions and family
              | members “significant others”. Additionally, intergenerational relationships are perceived
              | increasingly as socially significant, since the prolonging of average lifetime has enabled
              | parents to live on average more than 50 years of their child’s life (Lauterbach 1995) and
              | grandparents on average more than 20 years of their grandchild’s life (Lauterbach and Klein
meta          | 8
text          | 1997). In this time occur many intergenerational interactions and exchange processes, whose
              | structure we examine in the following.
              | Intergenerational Exchange Processes And Family Models
              | Research has registered increasing interest in intergenerational exchange and transfer of
              | support. Hereby the focus is on support grown up children offer their parents. At the
              | moment, the other direction of support from grandparents to their offspring plays a
              | subordinate role in research (Brandt 2009).
              | Yet, we argue both directions of transfers are important: a particular structural feature of
              | family relationships is the simultaneous intra- and intergenerationality and the constant
              | (unequal) exchange of social and material goods. These exchange relations (Figure 1) occur
              | horizontally within one generation, e.g. exchange of love between parents (G2), quarrels
              | between siblings (G3), competition between maternal and paternal grandparents (G1m,
              | G1v), but also vertically, e.g. exchange of caring support between parental generation (G2)
              | and care-dependant grandparents (G1).

              | In the following we will elaborate the East-West differences regarding intergenerational
              | exchange processes. We start by distinguishing four types of intergenerational support:
              | material, practical, cognitive and emotional (cf. Diewald 1991 and Table 1).

              | Material support occurs mainly through money transfers of different types (endowment,
              | credit, bank guarantee, etc.). According to DEAS (Deutscher Alterssurvey) data of 2008 17
              | percent of the 70 to 85-year-olds provide material transfers to at least one of their children,
              | 18 percent provide direct transfers to their grandchildren. Concerning the 55 to 69-year-olds
              | more than 25 percent support their children and about 12 percent their grandchildren (Mahne
              | and Motel-Klingebiel 2010: 203). Comparing eastern and western Germany there are
              | considerable differences: In 2002 29 percent of western Germans older than 40 supported
              | their children with money transfers and noncash benefits, in eastern Germany this applied to
              | only 24 percent, in 2007 this applied to 27 percent in western Germany and 22 percent in
              | eastern Germany (Motel-Klingebiel, Wurm and Tesch-Römer 2010). Inheritances and
              | endowments occur more often and involve higher amounts in western Germany (Kohli et. al
              | 2001; Szydlik 2004).
meta          | 11
text          | Practical support is manifold; we are most importantly concerned with childcare. According
              | to DEAS data of 2008 55 to 69 year old grandparents, especially grandmothers, care for their
              | grandchildren most frequently (Mahne and Motel-Klingebiel 2010: 206). In 1996 36 percent
              | of eastern Germans older than 40, compared to 33 percent in western Germany, provided this
              | type of practical support. This is explained by a significantly higher share of people with
              | children and grandchildren in eastern Germany and does not hint to a necessity or a higher
              | degree of implicitness of this support in eastern Germany (Kohli and Künemund 2001).
              | Higher unemployment or early retirement of eastern German grandparents increases
              | opportunities to care for grandchildren (Uhlendorff 2003; Thelen 2005). However, these
              | ratios reversed: in 2002 and 2008 only 22 percent, 17 percent respectively, of the eastern
              | Germans older than 40 provided childcare as practical support, whereas western Germans
              | offered 30 percent, 27 percent respectively (Mahne and Motel-Klingebiel 2010: 207).
              | Cognitive support refers to the mediation of states of consciousness (Diewald 1991).
              | Intergenerational interactions communicate, pass on and modify cultural concepts, standards
              | and values. As stated above, some studies indicate a strong intergenerational correspondence
              | regarding attitude and behavior concerning gender roles, possibly underlying an
              | intergenerational transmission of standards and values. Other studies detect changing family
              | models and gender roles, indicating obsolete orientational knowledge of the older generation
              | in some areas, where hence the younger generation probably communicates orientational
              | knowledge to the elders. Concerning East-West comparison two things seem conceivable: a
              | reproduction of cultural concepts in western Germany due to relatively stable societal
              | circumstances, observable via the male breadwinner model; while in eastern Germany
              | attitudes and behavior from GDR times (many employed mothers, compatibility of family
              | and career) became obsolete, disabling parents to offer their children orientational
              | knowledge. Considering societal change in western Germany, it is also thinkable, that
meta          | 12
text          | orientational knowledge of western German parents (standard employment) is viewed as
              | inadequate causing uncertainty, regarding starting and organizing a family, with the younger
              | generation (Author YEAR). Empirical studies, concerned with whether and how family
              | models and gender roles are passed on via cognitive support, are rare.
              | Emotional support depicts an important personal resource. Compared to their western
              | German counterpart young eastern German adults specified slightly more often a closer
              | relationship to their parents and that they help with personal problems (Masche 2000).
              | According to Masche a higher family orientation as a GDR relic is not necessarily the cause
              | for stronger generational bonds, but the higher concentration of problems (e.g.
              | unemployment) in eastern Germany compared to western Germany.
              | Regarding family models and gender roles our knowledge about precise transmissions
              | between generations and East-West differences is limited and results are contradictory.
              | Further, there is little knowledge, regarding the role of (expected) support, of how these
              | transfers affect transmission or persistency and transformation of gender roles and family
              | models. With this article we seek to examine: 1.) Which different types of gender role
              | models, family models and arrangements of division of labor in relationships exist in eastern
              | and western Germany? 2.) Which kind of support do young adults expect, receive
              | respectively, from their parents, especially when starting a family? Of complementary
              | interest: Which kinds of support are provided by grandparents to their children? Which
              | support would they offer when their children start a family? 3.) How do these expected
              | supports affect transmission or persistency and transformation of gender roles and family
              | models?
meta          | 13
text          | DATA AND METHODS
              | To answer these questions we revert to qualitative interviews with young adults from eastern
              | and western Germany, which were conducted in 2004/5 as part of a bigger research project
              | (cf. Bernardi, Keim, Lippe 2007; Bernardi, Keim, Klärner 2014). This project examined how
              | the social network of young adults influences the decision for parenthood and the precise
              | arrangement of cohabitation in partnerships and families. Altogether 118 interviews were
              | conducted, with: (1) the main interviewee (ego), young adults with intermediate and higher
              | educational qualification, and if possible (2) their partners, (3) parents and (4) friends
              | (alteri). The majority of our interviewees were childless at the time of the interview. Some
              | had one child, a few two children. We conducted the interviews in an eastern German and a
              | western German town: Rostock and Lübeck. Apart from belonging to different societal
              | systems during the 40 years of the division of Germany both towns are similar in many
              | ways: they are Hanseatic cities located in the protestant north of Germany and inhabit about
              | 200,000 people. Both towns experience high unemployment, though it was a lot higher in
              | Rostock when the interviews took place (13.8 percent in Lübeck compared to 7.6percent in
              | western Germany; 18.2 percent in Rostock compared to 17.7 percent in eastern Germany).
              | The problem-centered interviews (Witzel and Reiter 2012) with ego focused on life hitherto
              | and future plans, particularly regarding partnership, imaginations concerning starting a
              | family and intergenerational and other relationships. The interviews with ego’s parents dealt
              | with their experiences starting a family, imaginations and wishes regarding their children’s
              | life, the relationship to their children and interactions and exchange processes.
              | Interviews lasted 60 to 120 minutes and contained narrative passages about individual
              | attitudes concerning gender roles and labor division in a relationship, actually practiced labor
              | division, imaginations regarding the labor division upon arriving parenthood, attitude and
meta          | 14
text          | imagination of childcare and the role of grandparents. The interviews were transcribed
              | verbatim and analyzed according to the method of thematic coding (Flick 2014).
              | For this article we have analyzed all available interviews concerning presented family
              | models and gender arrangements as well as received and expected support. In order to
              | examine how support contributes to persistency or change of family models and gender
              | roles, we have analyzed the 25 available parent-child dyads from both towns comparatively.
              | RESULTS
              | Analyzing the ego interviews there are important differences between eastern and western
              | Germany, regarding attitudes concerning family formation, , gender roles, childcare and
              | practical arrangements concerning family life and work (see Table 2).

              | Interviewees in Lübeck favor a gender-neutral allocation of tasks in the partnership and
              | household. Male and female interviewees share the view that women are entitled to higher
              | education and full-time employment, but only as long as there are no children in a
              | partnership. If children are planned or already born almost all interviewees from Lübeck
              | radically breach with favoring (and practicing) gender-neutral arrangements and revert to the
              | male breadwinner model which was practiced and exemplified by their parents. A few
              | interviewees problematize this model, because it penalizes women in advancing in
              | occupational life, but are unable to establish a different labor division “in their special case”.
meta          | 16
text          | The rather depreciative characterization of fulltime institutional childcare, especially for
              | children younger than three, is conspicuous.
              | I’m not a mother who gives her child to a nanny, because I have to work. I
              | would only do this if I needed to financially. (…) But I actually think it’s
              | terrible for the children. (…) Being close to the mother, I think, that’s very
              | important for children. (L03ef0, female, living apart together, childless)
              | Many female interviewees who enjoy and want to keep their current full-time employment
              | declare uncertainty about when and whether they want children or have already decided to
              | remain childless, because they rule out compatibility of career and family:
              | It’s not like I’m strictly against having children, but I say, I don’t need them
              | (…) The point is, I don’t want to give up my life…. [Having children] is a
              | full-time job and I would be financially dependent on my husband, I couldn’t
              | work the first three years, because I wouldn’t know where to keep the child.
              | (L58ef, female, single, childless)
              | The childless interviewees from Rostock show no distinct awareness of problems concerning
              | compatibility of career and family or division of labor in a partnership – the actual practiced
              | division of labor is not necessarily completely egalitarian though. However, both partners
              | show an egalitarian orientation towards full-time employment. Unlike with western German
              | interviewees, this conception remains unchanged with children in the relationship. Full-time
              | employment of women and mothers is natural, housewives are a deviation:
              | We had one in primary school whose mother was a housewife. And we
              | always asked him, what does your mother do, what does she do the whole

text          | day? That was a really exotic creature for us, a housewife. (R02ef0, female,
              | single, childless)
              | The compatibility of family and career is unburdened by conveniently available full-time
              | childcare facilities, which are not considered problematic for the child. Interviewees from
              | Rostock, in contrast to Lübeck, do not regularly expect help from grandparents concerning
              | childcare.
              | Looking closer at the different support expectations and transfers, we find that most
              | interviewees from both towns report (very) good relationships to parents/parents-in-law and
              | state frequent contact. Family conflicts, possibly leading to severance, occur sparsely. Our
              | analysis focuses on transfers from parents (G1) to their children (G2). We considered
              | interviewees who already have children (G3) and who are childless.
              | The interviewees from both towns have different expectations concerning support (see Table
              | 3). We observed mostly a congruence between expectations of young adults to their parents
              | regarding support and willingness and capability of the parents to provide support.
              | Individual interviewees, whose parents we could not interview, complain about a poor
              | relationship to their parents and wish for more support.

              | parenthood is natural
              | Interviewees from Lübeck and Rostock experience identical emotional support from their
              | parents: They feel safe and trust their parents as helpers in need and reliable interactional
              | partners. The other types of support indicate important differences. Material support is very
              | important for interviewees from Lübeck: parents support their children financially
              | (frequently or selectively concerning bigger acquisitions), they provide housing
              | (condominium, or flat in the parents’ house), they also take over bigger acquisitions for the
              | grandchild and start savings plans. Most interviewees from Lübeck emphasize that their
              | parents grant them financial security and thus ease starting a family. Even in difficult
meta          | 19
text          | situations (e.g. when unintentionally getting pregnant during education) they can rely on this
              | support.
              | Contrary to this material support plays an irregular role with the interviewees from Rostock.
              | They benefit less from parental support. Access to material support is also unimportant when
              | starting a family and thus not an issue.
              | There are also important differences concerning the availability of practical support. The
              | (grand)parents (especially the grandmother) of the parents among the interviewees from
              | Lübeck regularly help with childcare on certain days or at least quite often to allow a part-
              | time employment of the young mothers:
              | Sure my parents-in-law and my parents offered help already during my wife’s
              | pregnancy. (…) and now my wife works eight days a month, every second
              | weekend Friday to Monday. Saturday, Sunday I am there anyways. And
              | Fridays he is with her parents and Sundays, Mondays with my parents, works
              | well. (L53em1, male interviewee married, 1 child; mother: housewife, father:
              | employee; mother-in-law: part-time employed, father-in-law: early-retired).
              | Many childless Lübeck interviewees thinking about parenthood expect their potential
              | grandparents to provide this kind of support once grandchildren are there.
              | However, inability of grandparents to care for their grandchildren due to geographical
              | distance, full-time employment, old age, sickness or poor contact is mostly viewed as a
              | deficit leaving the Lübeck interviewees unsure about how to organize childcare and
              | occupational comeback of the mother:
              | My parents are not there, her parents are not there for us, … they are simply
              | not there, to create time for us (…) also to create leeway for my wife. So that
meta          | 20
text          | she says, she gets other tasks apart from only seeing (the son). (L59em1,
              | male, married, 1 child, broken ties to parents and parents-in-law due to
              | dispute)
              | The Rostock interviewees assume that grandparents’ support alone is insufficient to enable
              | an employment for the mother. They do not expect regular support; oftentimes they do not
              | receive it since both grandparents work full-time or live far away. Even if a grandparent is
              | early-retired or unemployed, regular help with childcare is not expected. However, parents
              | can rely on their parents’ help in emergencies if those live nearby and the relationship to
              | them is good.
              | Cognitive support for instance refers to children orienting their own behavior by the
              | attitudes, behavior, values and experiences of their parents. This is particularly apparent with
              | the western German interviewees. They explicitly justify their positive evaluation of the
              | male breadwinner model and rejection of both parents working full-time with experiences in
              | their family of origin:
              | I think it’s good if someone stayed with the child, I can say this from
              | experience, because my mother didn’t work, I also cannot imagine how it is if
              | both parents work. (L05em, male, single, childless; mother: housewife, father:
              | public officer)
              | Concerning this issue and the perception of children as “calculated risk”, the attitudes and
              | behavior of the interviewed young adults and their parents coincide strongly. Children are
              | considered potentially threatening to material wealth if there was not a certain standard of
              | material security established beforehand. Before starting a family, parents (G1) from Lübeck
              | expect from their children first to finish vocational training, enter into employment, for the
              | husband to find a reliable employment and earn a certain material basis. This attitude is
meta          | 21
text          | shared by the children (G2), who thus mostly have specific ideas about how and when to
              | start a family. Shared is also the ideal of a mother who above all cares for their children and
              | a rather negative evaluation of full-time employed “career-obsessed” mothers.
              | Conspicuously, interviewees from Lübeck hardly challenge “traditional” gender roles and
              | partnership arrangements.
              | Only some interviewees from Lübeck refer to societal change (e.g. educational expansion,
              | pluralism of lifestyles and family structures, increase of instable employment) and resulting
              | differences to their parents.The Rostock interviewees and their parents show congruence
              | concerning the attitude that parenthood is natural and can be arranged flexibly. Both also
              | view employment of mothers positively. Partially, the own parents are also seen as role
              | models:
              | My parents both have their career, have made arrangements. And they have
              | divided the work. That’s my requirement to a relationship…Well, sure, my
              | mother did the ironing and my father repaired the bikes, but my father also
              | cleaned and he didn’t dodge any work, …that’s quite emancipated. And I
              | imagine it like this, too. (R02ef0, female, childless)
              | Oftentimes the issue is raised that things common in the GDR are not transferrable to today’s
              | circumstances:
              | It’s not like people “take their time“, they are forced to get children later. At
              | age 26 one was latest parturient in the GDR. And today it’s easy, one has to
              | finish vocational training first, before one can take the time for children. Then
              | they say, especially with any academic higher degrees, I have to make my
              | career first, get used to working first, it’s the women after all who get the
              | children and to get them back to work. They want to establish a basis first.
meta          | 22
text          | Insofar “they don’t take their time” – they are forced to organize time
              | differently. (R19ef1, female, cohabiting, 1 child)
              | This quote implies that the eastern German interviewees also experience the necessity to
              | consider a stronger sequencing of life events – first career, then children. However, speaking
              | of “West-Germanization” here would be wrong. Neither intrinsic motivation nor the inner
              | need for security – which apply to the western German interviewees – make such sequencing
              | desirable. It is rather an externally imposed “enforcement” which makes an orientation
              | towards occupational careers appear necessary, since otherwise mothers cannot realize full-
              | time employment, which is taken for granted. Hence, longer career breaks after giving birth
              | or part-time employment do not indicate a voluntary approximation to a “western German
              | lifestyle” or “western German family model”, these rather respond to the difficult
              | employment situation of mothers in eastern Germany.
              | Apart from emotional support our interviews exhibited important East-West differences
              | concerning all other types. Material help and practical support regarding childcare are
              | increasingly provided or expected by the western German interviewees. Cognitive support is
              | received by interviewees from both towns, contents differ entirely though. In Lübeck
              | children are ill-reputed by both generations as calculated risk and the male breadwinner
              | model alongside the ideal of the caring mother is passed on. In Rostock parents pass on the
              | naturalness of “having children”, compatibility of family and work and flexibly managing
              | both.
              | To examine how intergenerational relationships and support affect the conveying of gender
              | roles, we have contrasted the narratives of female egos (G2) with the ones of their mothers
              | (G1). Two case examples featuring young women from Lübeck and Rostock illustrate
meta          | 23

              | and partnership arrangements.
              | CASE STUDIES
              | Both cases feature young women with each one child. The case illustration focuses primarily
              | on narratives (from G2) concerning the decision for parenthood, labor division in the
              | partnership and the how the parents influenced these processes. Additionally we have
              | analyzed the narratives of the respective mother concentrating on statements concerning

              | Lübeck: Lisa And Lisbeth (L15)
              | Lisa is 29 years old at the time of the interview, has a nine month old child and is on
              | maternity leave. Concerning her lifestyle and thoughts she represents a typical case from
              | Lübeck. She is married to a public officer older by four years, has a higher qualification and
              | is just starting her civil service career. She maintains a good relationship to her parents and
              | mother-in-law, who live in the same town, including close and frequent contact.
              | Lisbeth, Lisa’s mother, is 55 years old, housewife, mother of two and also married to a
              | public officer. After completing her vocational training and working shortly in her job she
              | became pregnant at age 21. Her husband was already 31 and public officer. As planned they
              | married first and had the first child, Lisa’s older sister then. Lisbeth has been a housewife
              | until Lisa was three years old, then she worked part-time for 12 hours a week.
              | Lisa was a lot older than her mother at her first pregnancy, but she and her partner were in
              | the same biographic phase: Lisa and partner got their first child after completing vocational
              | training and achieving a reliable occupation. Their division of labor was mostly egalitarian
meta          | 24
text          | before the child. Ever since Lisa is responsible for child and household and her husband acts
              | as main breadwinner. Unlike her mother, Lisa seeks part-time employment once the child
              | turns one. Full-time employment is out of question in the near future.
              | Lisbeth supports Lisa’s attitude. It is important for her that mothers “are there for their
              | children”, but also that women earn their own living in emergencies (she particularly thinks
              | of risk to divorce) and thus should learn a good profession and refrain from interrupting
              | work for too long. Therefore she has offered regular support in childcare and they have
              | arranged that she and Lisa’s mother-in-law will share providing this support, once Lisa
              | returns to work:
              | With Lisa, her mother-in-law and I want to share it, Lisa wants to return to
              | work in May, twelve hours, then one day the one mother takes and another
              | day the other mother, that’s okay, nowadays without grandma and grandpa
              | one can’t get children anymore. (Lisbeth)
              | Thus Lisbeth clings to traditional gender roles, but also enables, due to her childcare
              | commitment, a modernization of this family arrangement. Providing support is also
              | connected to propagating attitudes and values. Lisbeth describes her mother image:
              | I favor, that mothers are there for their children, but they should also work, if
              | possible not the whole day. As for me children come first before work.
              | (Lisbeth)
              | Thanks to the social support via her parents, Lisa seemingly takes this combination of family
              | and work for granted. She refuses extra-familial and institutional childcare, because the
              | family provides “better” care and ought to be preferred, an attitude shared by many western
              | German interviewees. She also senses certain social pressure and knows,
meta          | 25
text          | If one chooses a nanny, the parents would feel offended. (Lisa)
              | Hence, the parents offering social help is also linked to expectations in return, specifically
              | refraining from “giving away” the own child to “external care”, as well as from working
              | fulltime and havint to rely on all-day care.
              | Rostock: Ronja And Renate (R11)
              | Ronja is 29 years old and has a four year old child. She achieved a higher qualification and
              | has a full-time, although temporary, employment. She is unmarried, but is in a partnership
              | with the child’s father. He also achieved a higher qualification and has a permanent full-time
              | contract. Renate, Ronja’s mother, is 54 years old, married, has two children and works full-
              | time in a well-paid ambitious job which corresponds to her university degree.
              | When speaking about organizing childcare Ronja’s parents are not mentioned. Ronja and her
              | husband take turns. The rather egalitarian role allocation has prevailed since childbirth. They
              | practice the two-income model and trust public childcare facilities. Ronja says: “My son has
              | gone to kindergarten since he turned one”. They are independent from their parent’s support
              | and do not expect it.
              | There are remarkable similarities between Renate and Ronja concerning labor division in a
              | partnership. Answering the interviewer’s question if she could generally understand that
              | highly educated people are fixed on their occupational career and voluntarily relinquish
              | having children, Renate says she has “always worked (…), I have never stayed at home”, she
              | “did not take maternity leave”, and still they shared the remaining time with the children.
              | Accordingly, both her children did not suffer from her occupational life and she is pleased
              | with how her children grew up and how they are living. This also applies when she had to
              | travel in her job and was often absent at home – then her husband took over: “When I wasn’t
meta          | 26
text          | there, he was for the children. That’s somewhere manageable, if one wants to”. Renate’s and
              | her husband’s parents were unable to help, because all four were working. The availability of
              | public childcare facilities helped them a lot. Ronja and her partner have a similar
              | arrangement. Both work and equally care for their child. Renate’s influence on Ronja and
              | her support is rather emotional and cognitive. Ronja adopted her quasi-natural attitude
              | towards children from Renate, i.e. children are part of life. The cognitive orientation exceeds
              | the propagation of functioning, inelastic behavioral patterns and role models. It is more
              | flexible and manifests itself in a type of arranging ability:
              | Fortunately, [Ronja] completed her studies almost in the standard period,
              | which was tough, but couldn’t get her traineeship then, that takes long, before
              | it’s your turn. She said, then she gets her child in between, I thought that was
              | great. I think we partially exemplified this, that it’s not that difficult with a
              | child. They have other problems than us, with security. Housing is not an
              | issue, but work, career opportunities…but both are, my son-in-law, well they
              | are not married, today it’s also not that anymore…but they both got a job, and
              | this without problems after studying. (Renate)
              | This reveals that Renate consciously tries to pass on the cognitive certainty to be able to
              | actually overcome such difficulties and trust that this harms neither parents nor children.
              | SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
              | Our interviewees from Rostock and Lübeck demonstrate important differences concerning
              | personal preferences and actually practiced gender arrangements in a partnership. The
              | western German interviewees do opine egalitarian attitudes concerning women participating
meta          | 27
text          | in occupational life and labor division in partnerships, but in most cases only when there are
              | no children, yet. Upon the birth of the first child the male breadwinner model, exemplified
              | by the grandparents, is usually adopted. This model is partially modernized by
              | acknowledging that women, mothers respectively, are needed to participate in gainful
              | employment. Besides insufficient public childcare, the traditional ideal of a mother, which is
              | internalized by our interviewees, disfavors full-time employment. Mothers are widely
              | regarded as the nature’s best guardian who fends for a good development of the child. Many
              | women struggle to reconcile their wish for children and their mother image with their
              | conceptions concerning professional life. They are unsure whether and when to get a child or
              | relinquish having children in favor of practicing their profession.
              | An egalitarian partnership arrangement, where women return to full-time employment after
              | getting a child, childcare is organized cooperatively and public institutions are trusted, is
              | much more common and natural for the eastern German interviewees. Deviations from the
              | two-income model are mainly caused by unemployment or vocational training and less by
              | refusal or reservations regarding institutional childcare.
              | So, how do intergenerational relationships affect the passing on (and transition) of gender
              | roles and partnership arrangements?
              | We demonstrated that western and eastern Germans usually maintain close relationships,
              | which are characterized by frequent interactions and mutual support, to their parents and
              | parents-in-law. However, differences concerning the attributed importance of and access to
              | certain types of support were evident.
              | The western German interviewees benefit from more frequent and higher material transfers.
              | Financial security is also an especially important precondition for starting a family (cf. also
              | Author YEAR). Thus the interviewed young adults attach value to the opportunity of
meta          | 28
text          | receiving material support from their parents. This also applies essentially to practical
              | support in childcare. The grandparent’s help is necessary because of insufficient public
              | childcare possibilities and unwanted public childcare for little children or longer periods of
              | time since external care is evaluated negatively. These close intergenerational relationships
              | provide certain material and practical support (most likely from grandparents to parents), but
              | also pass on or negotiate oriental knowledge. Concerning the importance of support related
              | to childcare, the western German interviewees feel in a way dependent on their parent’s help
              | who also possess considerable power to sanction if their children act outside their
              | expectations. The social trade-off simultaneously constitutes interdependency (Blau 1964),
              | whereby the grandparents emphatically formulate certain role expectations to their children,
              | especially their daughters who ought to take care of the children primarily. Since most
              | grandparents strongly opine a male breadwinner model, a modernization is limited. Indeed,
              | the two-income model including children is unimaginable for most of our western German
              | interviewees or even offensively refused by both generations. However, even the
              | interviewees in Lübeck have undergone change and both generations emphasize preference
              | of a modernized breadwinner model where the mother works part-time. Especially parents of
              | daughters are aware that partnerships and also occupations lack stability compared to their
              | times. Thus they often urge their daughter to learn a profession and return to their occupation
              | part-time shortly after the birth. For this they offer support concerning childcare.
              | Contrary, the access to comparably small material and partially practical support does not
              | prevent the eastern German interviewees from starting a family: they do not necessarily
              | require a high degree of financial security. Regular childcare via the grandparents is also
              | considered unnecessary, because most interviewees perceive sufficient public care facilities
              | and adequate care. In comparison to the western German interviewees they do not
              | experience such strong dependency on the grandparents. Hence, the eastern German
meta          | 29
text          | interviewees enjoy more leeway following gender models, partnership arrangement
              | respectively, different from their parents. Originally we assumed that, due to the societal
              | turnaround, orientational knowledge of the grandparents in eastern Germany had become
              | obsolete. However, the interviews in Rostock showed that the younger generation shares
              | many beliefs and values with their parents: the two-income model with children and flexibly
              | managing family and professional life is still natural, coping with adverse circumstances is
              | passed on from generation to generation. Thus it is important that changed circumstances do
              | not conclude outdated orientational knowledge. The type of passed on orientational
              | knowledge ought to be subject to research. We claim the eastern German interviewees are
              | better prepared for the current situation in the unified Germany – e.g. difficult employment
              | situation, problems arranging family and career – because both partners show more
              | flexibility, pragmatism and willingness to work full-time. Part-time employment or non-
              | working mothers are possible, an arrangement which is less opposed by grandparents in
              | eastern Germany than the two-income model in western Germany. For this reason the
              | eastern German interviewees are also less likely to respond to the mentioned difficulties with
              | postponing the decision for parenthood or relinquish having children. Although the eastern
              | Germans hardly raise issues concerning gender equality, one must record that in practice
              | women still contribute more to chores and childcare.
              | Our data does not suffice to answer the question concerning change or persistency and
              | reproduction of unequal gender roles and partnership arrangements clearly, least of all
              | representatively for eastern and western Germany. The investigation of people with a low
              | educational level would be especially interesting, as our sample lacked those. Many factors
              | caused the still existing differences between eastern and western Germany, which
              | subsequently enforce the reproduction of gender inequalities and traditional family models:
              | the fiscal system, labor market structures, personal preferences, cultural aspects etc.
meta          | 30
text          | However, the availability, (alleged) dependency and actual exchange of social support and
              | orientational knowledge between grandparents and parents also play an important role. We
              | hereby claim the mentioning of this insufficiently considered factor.
              | To formulate a concluding thesis: Receiving cognitive orientation from the grandparents
              | causes the passing on of traditional role models, which the younger parent generation orients
              | itself by. This intensifies if there are dependencies concerning material and/or practical
              | support. However, the passed on models are bound to change according to current societal
              | circumstances. Parents and their children in western Germany assume that the pure
              | housewife model has become impractical and employment of the mother necessary and thus
              | cause a modernization of the male breadwinner model in practice. However, the traditional
              | attitude, that mothers above all have to take care of their children, persists. Either way an
              | occupation is secondary. This opposes the implementation of the two-income model and an
              | egalitarian labor division in partnerships. The availability and (alleged) dependency
              | concerning grandparental material and practical support also provokes the western German
              | interviewees to be emotionally dependent on them and their judgments thus limiting
              | opportunities to modernize.
              | The passing on from one generation to the next is beneficial for the eastern German
              | interviewees. This enables finding a flexible arrangement of chores and employment in a
              | partnership, eases compatibility of family and professional life and lowers labor market
              | risks. This discourages desisting from the ideal two-income model (employment of mothers
              | is still valued positively), but also accepts the male breadwinner model if necessary. What
              | seems to be an adjustment to western German conditions may also be interpreted as “typical
              | eastern German pragmatism”, as coping with adverse circumstances, which refrains from
meta          | 31
text          | changing the fundamental attitude that full-time employment of mother is possible and
              | desirable.
