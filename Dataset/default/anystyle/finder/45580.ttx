              | laws on the treatment of animals in all liberal countries demand that animals
              | be stunned before being slaughtered in order to prevent their suffering. This is
              | derived from a widely-shared concern for animal welfare. However, in many
              | Western countries, exemptions from this legal requirement have been granted to
              | Jewish and Muslim communities so that they can continue to perform ritual

              | ritually slaughtered animals be “compensated” for their experiencing a more
              | painful death by raising these animals in better conditions than others.

              | Introduction1
              | Current laws on the treatment of animals in all liberal countries demand that
              | animals be stunned before being slaughtered in order to prevent their suffering.
              | In many Western countries, exemptions from this legal requirement have been
              | granted to Jewish and Muslim communities (Haupt 2007).2 But Muslim and

              | 2 This provision is accepted by many European countries, the US, and Canada. See for instance
              | the Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 of 24 September 2009 on the protection of ani-
              | mals at the time of killing, art. 3.4; Council Directive 93/119/EC of 22 December 1993 on
              | the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing, art. 5.2. Switzerland, Norway,
              | Sweden, and Latvia have not admitted such exemptions, thus affirming the priority of ani-
              | mal welfare over the right to freedom of religion. The Polish constitutional court recently
              | overturned a ban on ritual slaughter. For a general discussion see Ferrari and Bottoni (2013).

              | Jewish ritual methods of slaughter are considered unacceptable by a number of
              | groups concerned with the suffering of animals. Indeed, ritual methods of
              | slaughtering require that animals be slaughtered without having been stunned,
              | thus causing significant pain during their slaughter.3
              | On the one hand, ritual slaughter seems to be unacceptable not only to those
              | concerned with animal rights, who reject any kind of killing of animals, but
              | also to those with more moderate worries for the welfare of animals, who might
              | allow the killing of animals but are concerned with their suffering. On the other
              | hand, ritual slaughter seems to be justified insofar as it is an expression of the
              | right to freedom of religion. Hence, there seems to be a clash between the right
              | to religious freedom and the widespread concern for animal welfare.
              | In this paper I propose a conditional solution to this clash between values.
              | Before presenting my argument, I want to emphasize that I will not argue for
              | the overall admissibility of ritual slaughter. My claim will be more limited: I
              | will try to see whether ritual slaughter can be made compatible with a general
              | concern for animal welfare. In a sense my claim will rest within the boundaries
              | of non-ideal theory, because I will accept most of the current rules and practic-
              | es surrounding the relation between humans and animals. In other words, I will
              | propose an improvement of the current system of raising animals that does not
              | challenge its justification.
              | To do this, I will start from the uncontroversial assumption that qua general
              | principles both the right to freedom of religion and the concern for animal
              | welfare are sound and justified. I will also assume that neither animal welfare
              | nor religious freedom have priority; rather, I will assume that they are on an
              | equal footing. This does not mean that I am subscribing to a form of metaethi-
              | cal pluralism. I will simply take their clash at face value. To argue for the prior-
              | ity of one over the other we would need a complete and substantive theory of
              | justice. In this paper my aim is obviously much more modest. Indeed I will
              | only discuss whether they can be made compatible without arguing for the
              | priority of one over the other.
              | To understand whether they can be made compatible in the case of ritual
              | slaughter we need to establish what exactly they demand of us. In the light of
              | this, I will argue that there is no convincing reason to consider the suffering
              | involved in the killing of animals more important than other types of suffering
              | they face during their lives (on farms). If so, to make ritual slaughter compati-
              | ble, at least in principle, with concerns for animal welfare, I will argue that we
              | might demand that ritually slaughtered animals be “compensated” for their
              | 3 Although some people claim that, if the slaughter is performed appropriately, the suffering
              | of ritually slaughtered animals is not significantly greater than that suffered by animals
              | facing standard slaughter methods, for the sake of simplicity I will not call into question the
              | standard assumption that ritual slaughter involves some significant amount of pain which is
              | greater than the pain involved in non-ritual slaughter.
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 111
              | more painful death. Such compensation might be made by raising these animals
              | in better conditions than those who will be stunned before slaughter. I will
              | conclude by defending this proposal against some standard objections and
              | argue it is only convincing if ritual slaughter is really essential to the mainte-
              | nance of religious tradition.
              | 2.
              | A Clash of Values?
              | The case of ritual slaughter seems to involve a clash between concerns about
              | animal welfare and those about religious freedom. The right to freedom of
              | religion is undoubtedly one of the fundamental liberal rights. Respecting this
              | right does not consist of the mere protection of a person’s inner sphere of belief
              | and faith. Rather, it includes a number of more specific rights, such as the right
              | to gather and pray in public. Among these rights we can include the right to eat
              | and follow the dietary prescriptions of one’s religion. Accordingly, ritual
              | slaughter is an expression of this general right. But there seems to be a case for
              | its limitation. Religious freedom is thought to be inviolable to the extent that its
              | exercise does not infringe upon other rights and the fundamental interests of
              | others. One might say that ritual slaughter is wrong precisely because it in-
              | fringes upon the rights of animals. However, it is not clear whether animals
              | hold rights. The least we can say is that this is a controversial claim and there is
              | a deep disagreement about this issue.4 Irrespective of whether animals hold
              | rights, however, most Western legislation displays a concern for animal welfare
              | that seems to be related to duties on the part of human beings. However, it is
              | not clear what justification might ground such a concern. Is it couched on a
              | rights-based view or on utilitarian grounds?
              | On the one hand, it certainly cannot be defended on a standard rights-based
              | view, because current rights-based views do not only demand that we take
              | animal welfare and suffering into account; they also argue that animals have an
              | inviolable right to life. On the other hand, one might think that an interest in
              | animal welfare and suffering is typically utilitarian. However, we might ask
              | whether such a utilitarian view should be applied only to animals or also in other
              | domains. But, since utilitarianism is an all-encompassing and monist theory, it
              | cannot only be applied to one domain (viz. animals) and not to other relevantly
              | similar domains (namely all sentient beings including human beings). In a word,
              | the principle that Nozick (1974, 41) called “utilitarianism for animals, Kantian-
              | ism for people” cannot be squared with utilitarian monism. Justifying this dis-
              | crimination is not only at odds with utilitarian monism but also with the commit-
              | 4 The importance of and the commitment to realizable institutional principles in a political
              | theory of human-animal relations is stressed also in Ahlhaus and Niesen (2015, in this HSR
              | Forum).
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 112
              | ment to anti-speciesism held by many utilitarians. Thus, if we want a utilitarian
              | justification of the treatment of animals, we must also be prepared to accept a
              | utilitarian justification in other fields of public ethics. But this would be quite
              | unpalatable for many of us. Thus, although certain types of utilitarianism could
              | endorse the idea that we have duties towards animals, this would be at the price
              | of an endorsement of overall utilitarian principles, which would also require
              | significant changes to current laws and principles. Given the non-ideal premis-
              | es of this paper, the thorough utilitarian option seems unfeasible.
              | There may be other contending moral theories, but it is not clear which
              | grounds the current protection of animal welfare. In general, approaches to the
              | protection of animal welfare can be indirect and direct. An indirect approach
              | would justify concern for animal welfare through a duty to respect human atti-
              | tudes, beliefs, or commitment towards animals. In indirect approaches animals
              | are beneficiaries of certain kinds of treatment, but human beings are the ad-
              | dressees of the direct obligations as well as the bearers of moral status. For
              | instance, some Italian laws concerning the prohibition of killing of and cruelty
              | to animals (articles 544-bis to 544-sexies of the Penal Code) are grouped in a
              | chapter devoted to the “offences against human sensitivity towards animals.”5
              | Direct approaches to the protection of animals, by contrast, ground duties
              | towards animals in the interests that animals have autonomously and inde-
              | pendently of human attitudes towards them. An example of this direct approach
              | can be found in the European Council Regulation on the protection of animals
              | at the time of killing (1099/2009 of 24 September 2009), which asserts that
              | “animal welfare is a Community value” (preamble 4). The scope of its applica-
              | tion is based not on our relation to animals but on “scientific evidence” demon-
              | strating that “vertebrate animals are sentient beings” (preamble 19).6
              | However, it must be emphasized that there seems to be an ambiguity in
              | many current legal systems regarding whether the protection of animals is
              | grounded in direct or indirect duties towards animals.7 Diverse pieces of legis-
              | 5 However, there is no coherent application of the indirect approach because such articles, as
              | well as article 727, which prohibits keeping animals in conditions that are incompatible with
              | their nature and that cause great suffering, point also at a direct approach. The reference to
              | animals’ ethological nature and specific needs is interpreted in the jurisprudence as a clear
              | recognition of animals’ subjective interest and humans’ corresponding direct duties.
              | 6 An even clearer example of the direct approach is the Swiss Federal Law (455, 16 December
              | 2005). In art. 1 the law states that the safeguarding of animal dignity is the overall aim of
              | the law.
              | 7 One prominent case is the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz), which demands that animals be
              | protected, as should nature, in virtue of the responsibility we have towards future genera-
              | tions (article 20a). Despite the prominence given to animals in legislation at the constitu-
              | tional level, this seems to be an indirect approach in virtue of its being grounded in the
              | well-being of future generations of human beings. On the contrary, the law on animal pro-
              | tection (Tierschutzgesetz, § 1) demands that human beings should be responsible for ani-
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 113
              | lation take different approaches or can be interpreted in both ways. Such an
              | ambiguity may be a legacy of past views that have not been amended, since a
              | full recognition of human direct duties towards animals would demand more
              | extensive (and unwanted) legal protection of animals. Hence, we cannot say
              | that all the relevant laws on animal welfare are based on a direct approach. On
              | the other hand, if we take the indirect approach seriously, it is difficult to un-
              | derstand what good is protected by laws aiming at animal welfare. Is it only
              | human sensitivity towards animal suffering that is protected? That is possible.
              | However, this would make it difficult to argue that the suffering of animals
              | should be prevented even when no human being would be offended. After all,
              | our sensitivity is not likely to be affected by hidden slaughter houses that do
              | not expose animal suffering to the public.
              | These are very intricate questions that cannot be settled here. In what fol-
              | lows I will discuss only direct approaches toward the protection of animal
              | welfare.8 This does not mean that we should disregard the indirect elements,
              | and nor does it mean that the conclusion I will draw is not valid for an indirect
              | approach. It means, rather, that the kinds of reasons we will consider, unless
              | otherwise specified, will regard the duties – if any exist – that we have directly
              | towards animals, not the duties we have towards the attitudes and beliefs of
              | other human beings towards animals. After all, although legal systems and
              | cultural practices are not immune to inconsistencies and ambiguities, a direct
              | approach towards animal welfare seems capable of capturing the widespread
              | idea that causing unnecessary suffering to a sentient being is intrinsically
              | wrong. This is why adopting a perspective based on direct duties seems a
              | worthwhile enterprise. One may object that such a direct approach is too mini-
              | mal if it can permit the killing of animals. That may be true. However, as I
              | have said, here my aim is not to ask whether the principles underlying current
              | legislation on animals are the most convincing. I simply start there in order to
              | ask whether and how we may reconcile the duty to care for animals and the
              | right to religious freedom that allows ritual slaughter.
              | As a preliminary remark, we should bear in mind that ritual slaughter was
              | originally intended to cause the quickest and least painful death to animals,
              | according to Jewish and Muslim traditions (Lerner and Rabello 2006/7). Such a
              | belief should not be discarded as mere self-deceit, because this might have
              | been the case at the time of its origination, according to the scientific
              | mals qua “fellow creatures” (Mitgeschöpf). And this seems to point at a direct concern for
              | animals.
              | 8 I have provided an alternative account based on an indirect view on the protection of
              | animals in Zuolo (2014). Although I think the indirect approach has the advantage of being
              | more clearly compatible with a number of admitted practices and with ritual slaughter in
              | particular, in this paper I assume that the account underlying current laws may be justified
              | as a set of direct duties. I cannot establish here which account is more convincing all things
              | considered.
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 114
              | knowledge and the tools available. The religious grounds of the practice may
              | have been that pain minimization was a way to respect the sacred nature of the
              | divine gift of creation.
              | Hence, we may say that Jewish and Muslim religious traditions have also
              | been committed to the minimization of animal suffering, despite the fact that
              | their understanding of this requirement is based upon religious rather than
              | contemporary scientific ideas. This means that if we take this idea at face val-
              | ue, as the grounding principle of the practice of ritual slaughter, there would,
              | strictly speaking, be no contradiction between religious freedom and animal
              | welfare – only a clash between two different understandings of the same prin-
              | ciple regarding animal welfare when it is applied to slaughter: one informed by
              | contemporary practices and science, and the other informed by traditional
              | religious techniques.9 This picture, which reinterprets a clash of values as a clash
              | of methods for reducing animal suffering, seems plausible. However, in the end,
              | the reason to consider the traditional practice of ritual slaughter so important is
              | that it seems to be at the core of Jewish and Muslim communities, touching upon
              | a fundamental part of these religions, namely eating10 in a way that is consistent
              | with one’s most important beliefs. Hence, the clash of values resurfaces again.
              | This qualification is important in order to prevent a further objection. If Jews and
              | Muslims should in principle eat only kosher and halal meat, whose production
              | seems to be at odds with other legal and moral requirements, why cannot we say
              | that Jews and Muslims ought to forsake meat eating and become vegetarian?
              | After all, this same choice is made by many people on moral grounds. If the
              | reasons for forbidding non-halal and non-kosher meat are so important, why
              | shouldn’t believers be willing and committed not to eating meat at all where it
              | does not comply with their religious requirements? This is a serious question
              | because we cannot take it for granted that any kind of practice that is typical of
              | a certain cultural and religious tradition is worthy, per se, of defense and spe-
              | cial treatment. I shall leave discussion of this issue to the final section. Here it
              | suffices to say that, whatever our response to the question of whether ritual
              | slaughter is fundamental to Jewish and Muslim traditions, we have another
              | reason for taking the practice of religious slaughter seriously. This is the rea-
              | sonable presumption that prohibiting halal and kosher meat would cause further
              | disadvantage to Muslims and Jews – two communities that have already suf-
              | fered extensive discrimination. Hence, we might say that whatever our position
              | 9 This is at least partially shown by the fact that some Jewish and Muslim theorists claim that
              | ritual killing is still the least painful way of slaughtering because, if the method is properly
              | performed, the animal loses consciousness immediately. However, the factual validity of this
              | claim is at least doubtful and discussing it would lead us astray.
              | 10 I focus only on meat eating, thus leaving aside the problem of the use of leather because
              | Muslim and Jewish communities seem to have divergent prescriptions on this, and because
              | wearing leather clothes does not seem to be an uncontroversially fundamental human need.
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 115
              | on ritual slaughter is, banning it would create further disadvantage (whether
              | justified or not) for two communities that already face discrimination.
              | 3.
              | What Does a Concern for Animal Welfare Require of Us?
              | This paper, in short, confronts the following question: What is so special about
              | slaughter? If we are really concerned with animal welfare, while still admitting
              | the permissibility of raising and killing animals for the sake of human nourish-
              | ment, why is the way in which they are killed so important? This is not to un-
              | derestimate the suffering involved in ritual slaughter. My point, rather, is to
              | argue that there seems to be a sort of hypocrisy or incoherent attitude regarding
              | animal suffering. If a concern for animal welfare requires the minimization of
              | suffering, why should this minimization of suffering specifically target the
              | killing of animals, rather than being more extensively applied to the whole life
              | of the raised animal? Anticipating a possible objection, one might say that con-
              | cern with animal suffering during slaughter is more feasible and realistic because
              | the alternative, namely providing better care during animals’ lives, would be too
              | costly. Cost is certainly a problem, in that more extensive care for animals during
              | their lives is certainly more costly than simply being concerned about their suffer-
              | ing at the very end of their lives. The former would require us to ban industrial
              | farming, or at least to raise animals using different methods, leaving them with
              | more space to move, more possibilities for interaction with other animals, more
              | time to spend with their offspring, and so on. It seems clear that much more can
              | be done to promote the welfare of farmed animals. A number of recent studies
              | show that farmed animals suffer even when there is no direct evidence of this
              | suffering (as there is during slaughter) (Aaltola 2012, 1-67). However, if we
              | focus on the suffering involved in slaughter rather than in an animal’s life simply
              | on the basis of cost, the normative grounding of our argument is both weak and
              | unclear. The only plausible way to defend the current focus on animal suffering
              | during slaughter is to claim that suffering during slaughter is different from –
              | and/or not reducible to – other types of suffering. Such a difference would justify
              | giving priority to suffering during slaughter, rather than other forms of suffer-
              | ing, and would ground the legal and moral obligation to stun animals. Let us
              | see what theories in animal ethics have to say about this issue.
              | We could give priority to the suffering caused by slaughter either because
              | we consider it to be of greater magnitude or because we have independent
              | reasons to prevent this type of suffering. The former holds true only if we sub-
              | scribe to a position that explains why suffering during slaughter is more weighty
              | than countless other minor types of suffering. If we look at this from a broadly
              | consequentialist perspective, it seems difficult to justify, because it either under-
              | estimates how much animals can suffer in industrial farming or overestimates
              | how seriously we ought to take the pain experienced by animals during the final
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 116
              | moments of their lives. Even if we do not subscribe to a thoroughly utilitarian
              | position, we can nevertheless frame the issue in terms of a measure of badness.
              | All sufferings derive from an aversive state or stimulus (pain, fear, anxiety,
              | discomfort) that should be assessed with respect to two fundamental dimen-
              | sions: intensity and duration.11 We may think that the suffering caused by
              | slaughter is far more intense than other kinds of suffering, but its duration is
              | certainly shorter than others, which are typically repeated many times. Unless
              | we take intensity more seriously than duration, which we have no obvious
              | reason to do, the two dimensions seem to be equally important in a determina-
              | tion of the respective amount of suffering. Hence, the suffering involved in
              | slaughter should be weighted through these two dimensions in the same way as
              | other types of suffering. And if so, it seems hard to justify the idea that the
              | suffering involved in slaughter has any kind of priority over that involved in
              | other parts of an animal’s life.
              | The alternative to placing more importance on the suffering caused by
              | slaughter is to see the types of activities involved in ritual slaughter (and in
              | other types of slaughter without stunning) as wrong in themselves, irrespective
              | of whether the suffering involved during slaughter is quantitatively greater than
              | that experienced in industrial farming. On this view, it is the very mode of
              | killing without stunning that gives us a reason to forbid such an action. This
              | can be done either by adopting a virtue-based account or a Kantian view. First,
              | on a virtue-based account, it is intrinsically wrong to kill an animal without stun-
              | ning it insofar as this is a form of cruelty, which is per se intrinsically wrong. But
              | this claim seems to bear the burden of proof in showing why ritual slaughter is
              | intrinsically wrong while standard slaughter is not. To prove that it is intrinsically
              | wrong, we should consider only the intrinsic features of the act of killing irre-
              | spective of the type of consequences it involves. To do this, we have to show that
              | ritual killing is necessarily motivated by a vicious intention and/or that it neces-
              | sarily fosters vicious traits of character. But this seems particularly difficult to
              | show if we consider, as seen above, that ritual slaughter was introduced in the
              | beginning as a way of minimizing animal suffering. This means that the stand-
              | ard religious motivation for ritual slaughter may not stem from a desire to be
              | cruel but rather from a desire to minimize animal suffering. Hence, there seems
              | to be no cruel motivation involved in, and a virtue-based account would have
              | no reason to reject the practice.
              | The second way in which this perspective may be justified is the Kantian
              | view. As we know, according to Kant (1997), causing unnecessary pain to
              | animals is wrong, not in virtue of their direct interest in not suffering, but be-
              | cause cruel actions disrespect our humanity and are conducive to the develop-
              | ment of a cruel attitude towards other human beings. To assess this alternative,
              | 11 As is well-known, the origin of this approach to measuring value (and disvalue) dates back
              | to Bentham (1996, ch. 4). For a more recent version see Rowan (2012, 210).
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 117
              | let us put aside the fact that we are considering only justifications for animal
              | welfare based on direct duties towards animals, and that this concern for the
              | development of wrongful and vicious attitudes seems at odds with the overall
              | legal principle that laws should be concerned with behaviors, not intentions.
              | First, the idea that (ritual) slaughtering is more conducive to developing vicious
              | attitudes and behaviors is factually dubious. If this were the case, one might
              | also argue that people who perform slaughter according to the ritual method or
              | witness such slaughter are more likely to be cruel towards other human beings.
              | But there does not seem to be any evidence supporting this claim. And the
              | burden of proof is borne by those who make it. Moreover, besides the dubious
              | factual reliability of this statement, it also has an unpalatable moral implication.
              | Indeed, it would amount to saying that in Jewish and Muslim communities
              | people are more likely to have cruel attitudes than in other religious communi-
              | ties. But this claim is disrespectful, to say the least.
              | There are other possible reasons for giving more weight to the suffering in-
              | volved in the killing of an animal rather than that experienced in the animal’s
              | life. Let us review them in brief. First, recall that in general animal rights views
              | cannot uphold this point because they wholeheartedly reject the idea that the
              | life of an animal is at human disposal (Regan 1983; Francione 2008; Don-
              | aldson and Kymlicka 2011). An animal’s right to life forbids the kind of prin-
              | ciple we are discussing here.12
              | A further possibility is to take a relational approach. Under the umbrella of
              | “relational approaches” I include diverse theories: feminist care-based ap-
              | proaches (Noddings 1984; Donovan 1999), associative accounts (Valentini
              | 2014), and pluralist positions (Anderson 2004; Scruton 2000). Needless to say
              | this is a very sketchy categorization. These theories differ in many relevant
              | respects, but for the purposes of this paper they can safely be discussed togeth-
              | er. Indeed, all these theories share the idea that, unlike utilitarianism and ani-
              | mal rights theories, the moral treatment we owe to animals cannot be estab-
              | lished a priori only on the basis of a natural property that animals have (mere
              | sentience in utilitarianism, or the capacity of being the subject-of-a-life for
              | Regan). Indeed, the treatment we owe to animals depends on the type of rela-
              | tions we have with them.
              | These approaches do not provide a univocal normative response to our prob-
              | lem. Some do not accept the killing of animals at all. Others hold that it is not
              | in principle wrong to kill animals provided that it is done in the proper way.13
              | However, it would seem odd to include among admissible methods, that is,
              | 12 Perhaps it is not in principle impossible to outline a rights-based approach that does not
              | necessarily include a right to life. However, this possibility is not considered by current pro-
              | ponents of standard rights-based views.
              | 13 On this remark see Donovan (1999), who supports feminist vegetarianism, and Paxton
              | George (1994), who argues against this duty, also on feminist grounds.
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 118
              | among those that are more respectful of animal nature and the expression of
              | care towards them, those that involve more suffering. Moreover, caring more
              | for an animal’s death than for an animal’s life would be utterly inconsistent
              | with the ideas grounding care-based theories.
              | Hence, upon reviewing consequentialist, virtue-based, Kantian, rights-based,
              | and care-based views, there seems to be no defensible argument for giving
              | priority to the suffering involved in slaughter rather than in the life of a raised
              | animal. The only remaining view that could justify giving priority to the suffer-
              | ing involved in slaughter would have to prioritize the final condition of an
              | individual’s life, giving it a special if not fundamental significance, perhaps
              | because the very final moments in an individual life constitute the truth of
              | one’s life. However, this view is deeply suspicious because it seems to depend
              | on religious and theological presuppositions that are controversial in them-
              | selves, and even more dubious when applied to animals. It seems more plausi-
              | ble, in sum, to suppose that if we are concerned with the suffering of animals,
              | we ought to estimate their suffering based on magnitude and frequency through
              | the whole of a life, without giving priority to its end. After all, giving priority
              | to the moment of death seems unwarranted and even based upon an anthropo-
              | centric bias. Accordingly, if we were to calculate the pains and sufferings in the
              | life of an animal that had been raised using standard methods on a typical in-
              | dustrial farm, it would almost certainly turn out that the suffering and pain
              | induced would outweigh the pain and suffering caused by ritual slaughter.
              | 4.
              | Suffering, Stunning, and Non-Discrimination
              | Building on this, I want to argue that there is a flaw both in legislation prohibit-
              | ing ritual slaughter and in that allowing it. First, prohibiting ritual slaughter
              | does not seem fully justified because, as seen, there is nothing special about the
              | pain inflicted during death in relation to the pain experienced by an animal
              | during its life. Second, allowing ritual slaughter might discriminate against
              | ritually slaughtered animals. This is so because both ritually slaughtered and
              | non-ritually slaughtered animals are raised in the same conditions (typically on
              | industrial farms), but the former experience the pain of ritual slaughter. While,
              | as seen, there is nothing special about this pain, the amount of suffering in-
              | volved tilts the balance of suffering in a way that is, quantitatively, unfair to
              | ritually slaughtered animals. Indeed, it seems fair to say that, whatever the
              | assessment of death to which one subscribes, ritually slaughtered animals suf-
              | fer more than non-ritually slaughtered animals. Hence, we seem to discriminate
              | against ritually slaughtered animals. And, if we ought to be concerned with the
              | suffering of animals because suffering is intrinsically wrong, and in virtue of
              | the fact that we have some direct duties to animals, this discriminatory treat-
              | ment is unjustified.
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 119
              | At this point, we may wonder why we should be concerned with the principle
              | of non-discrimination between types of animals if we are ready to kill them.14
              | After all, non-discrimination might derive from the principle of equal treatment,
              | and theories that invoke the principle of equal treatment of animals, whether in
              | the form of equal status for individuals or the principle of equal consideration of
              | interests, would not allow the killing and exploitation of animals for the purpose
              | of human nourishment.15 Put this way, the idea of equality or non-discrimination
              | seems to be either misplaced or the kind of concern that should be taken into
              | account only after considering a more fundamental normative principle, that is,
              | respect for animal life and the minimization of animal suffering. Furthermore,
              | one may think that the broad welfarist position discussed here resembles utilitari-
              | anism in certain respects. And, as we have seen, utilitarianism is not committed to
              | non-discrimination per se, unless it can be demonstrated to be conducive to a
              | greater aggregate well-being. Indeed, one may say that in a version of act utilitar-
              | ianism that is not committed to Singer’s inter-specific egalitarianism of interests,
              | my worry regarding non-discrimination would not be warranted. After all, on
              | such a view, discriminating against the interests of a class of human or non-
              | human individuals might in principle be justified if such discrimination would
              | bring about a better aggregate outcome for all.16 In sum, it is not clear that we can
              | justify the duty not to discriminate between types of animals if we do not accept a
              | proper form of egalitarianism for animals.
              | While these objections are interesting, I submit that there are reasons for
              | taking the non-discrimination of animals seriously even from the welfarist
              | perspective discussed here. This can be proved without making reference to the
              | egalitarian principles embraced by some rights-based theories. The advantage
              | of this strategy is that the resulting argument will be more acceptable from a
              | number of perspectives, including those that are at odds with inter-specific egali-
              | tarianism. To prove this, I will proceed, first, by advancing a positive argument in
              | favor of my proposal and, second, by calling the tenability of the alternative view
              | into question. In other words, I will first sketch the idea that a direct-duty per-
              | spective implicitly commits us to the principle of non-discrimination. Second, I
              | will argue that the alternative, namely of discriminating between ritually and non-
              | ritually slaughtered animals, has a bigger burden of proof and that the reasons
              | available to ground such a discrimination are unconvincing.
              | 14 I am grateful to Peter Niesen and Svenja Ahlhaus for pressing me to respond to this question.
              | 15 For the former category, see Regan (1983) and Francione (2008), for the latter, see Singer
              | (1993).
              | 16 If so, however, it is not clear how such a non-egalitarian act utilitarianism could justify the
              | discriminatory treatment of ritually slaughtered animals with respect to non-ritually
              | slaughtered ones. Certainly, this measure is more beneficial to the non-ritually slaughtered
              | animals, but it would be preferable to benefit both categories provided that such equal
              | treatment is not disadvantageous in other respects. In sum, this discrimination is sub-
              | optimal on utilitarian grounds.
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 120
              | We should recall that here I am discussing views endorsing a direct obliga-
              | tion toward animal welfare. There are diverse ways to ground an obligation
              | towards animal welfare. Whatever we think regarding the alleged animal right
              | to life, respect for animal welfare might be grounded in the idea that we ought
              | to respect animals’ sentience and natural dispositions. This holds true in gen-
              | eral, irrespective of whether we subscribe to a rights-based approach, utilitari-
              | anism, feminism, or welfarism. As I stated at the beginning of this paper, I do
              | not defend any of these views. Instead, I am interested in understanding the
              | implications of a direct approach towards animal welfare for the issue of ritual
              | slaughter. I simply assume that any of these views could reasonably be defend-
              | ed. What all of these views, and others, have in common is the idea that if we
              | owe a direct duty to an individual, that individual is supposed to have a feature
              | justifying our direct duties. In other words, the individual is recognized as
              | having an autonomous interest in not being harmed or in being benefited. This
              | obviously puts direct views in opposition to indirect views, according to which
              | – for instance, in the Kantian version – we ought not to cause unnecessary
              | suffering to a being because we ought to respect humanity (not “animality”).
              | This is to say that whatever theory we adopt in support of direct duties to ani-
              | mals, by adopting a direct view we implicitly assume that the individuals to
              | whom we owe such duties have subjective interests that merit consideration in
              | their own right and not (only) in virtue of other kinds of considerations, wheth-
              | er indirect or instrumental. In virtue of this feature of owing something to a
              | being that subjectively merits such a duty, it would be strange to assume that
              | other typical general meta-normative principles do not apply. If we assume, as
              | we do here, that we have direct duties towards animals and a responsibility to
              | maintain animal welfare, it would seem odd if we did not apply the principle of
              | non-discrimination toward the beings meriting our direct duties. The opposite
              | claim would certainly bear a bigger burden of proof. The burden is to explain
              | why we should treat some categories of animals differently.
              | To justify such a discrimination, it is worth remarking that in direct views a
              | being is entitled to certain treatment in virtue of its intrinsic features, not in
              | virtue of the dispositions regarding animals that the person who is under that
              | duty possesses. As such, we must ask what distinguishes ritually slaughtered
              | animals from non-ritually slaughtered animals, and whether such a difference is
              | sufficient to justify this discrimination. The only reason for this discrimination
              | is that animals are slaughtered ritually to respect the religious identity of Mus-
              | lims and Jews. However, there are two considerations that weaken this point in
              | normative terms. First, we may say that what distinguishes ritually slaughtered
              | animals from non-ritually slaughtered animals is not an intrinsic feature of
              | those animals, because they are ritually slaughtered only in virtue of the inde-
              | pendent choice of a human being. There is no intrinsic and specific feature of
              | animals that individually or collectively determines the fact that they merit
              | such slaughter and that might provide a reason for grounding this discrimina-
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 121
              | tion. Second, the normative reason for this discrimination is respect for the
              | right to religious freedom of Jews and Muslims. However, what this right de-
              | mands of us is not to discriminate a category of animals with respect to another
              | category; rather, it simply demands that such a right be respected. That certain
              | animals are discriminated against because of this religious need is an unfortu-
              | nate, but by no means necessary, consequence of the fact that there are different
              | religious doctrines and techniques for slaughtering animals. This means that the
              | religious difference is not a reason to discriminate against a category of animals
              | when there are alternatives available (and we will see in the next section what
              | the alternative is), because Jewish and Muslim practices do not demand that
              | ritually slaughtered animals suffer more than other animals. On the contrary, as
              | we have seen, ritual slaughter was probably devised as a practice for minimiz-
              | ing animal suffering according to the technological knowledge of the age in
              | which the practice was adopted.17
              | Now we can respond to the non-egalitarian utilitarian objection raised
              | above. Although it is true that the welfarist approach I propose here would not
              | be vindicated by this form of utilitarianism, it is not clear in our case how such a
              | non-egalitarian act utilitarianism could justify the unequal treatment of ritually
              | slaughtered animals with respect to non-ritually slaughtered ones. Certainly, this
              | measure is more beneficial to the non-ritually slaughtered animals, but it would
              | be preferable to benefit both categories provided that the equal treatment is not
              | disadvantageous in other respects. And the only way to argue against this non-
              | discrimination would be to point at the major costs incurred in granting better
              | treatment to ritually slaughtered animals. Although this is certainly a serious
              | argument, it is doubtful that even from this perspective the mere matter of costs
              | would outweigh the interests of ritually slaughtered animals in suffering less.
              | Hence, in virtue of the implicit commitment to non-discrimination of the di-
              | rect view and the lack of justification for discrimination, there seems no reason
              | not to uphold the principle of non-discrimination when it comes to animals, at
              | least with respect to their overall welfare and suffering.
              | 5.
              | A Possible Solution and a Modest, Though Provocative,
              | Proposal
              | To remedy the discrimination suffered by ritually slaughtered animals, one may
              | argue that we ought to abandon ritual slaughter altogether. This is one plausible
              | solution. But the more radical solution of banning the raising and killing of
              | 17 The same holds true at the legal level. In other words, even if the argument I propose here
              | was not a morally conclusive argument, it would be strange in a legal sense to treat ritually-
              | and non-ritually slaughtered animals differently.
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 122
              | animals seems to result from the same premises. However, if we want to make
              | sense of current legislation and if we take the right to freedom of religious
              | expression seriously, perhaps we can devise another way out of this unsettling
              | situation.
              | If we are concerned with animal welfare, but consider the killing of animals
              | acceptable, and if we want to respect the right to religious freedom, but are
              | worried about discriminating between ritually slaughtered and non-ritually
              | slaughtered animals, perhaps we could demand that the two categories of ani-
              | mal are given equal prospects of sufficiently high well-being in terms of the
              | amount of pain suffered throughout their whole lives. This means that we either
              | forbid ritual slaughter – but hold independent reasons for admitting it –, or we
              | demand that ritually slaughtered animals be treated better during their lives than
              | those that are not ritually slaughtered, so as to compensate for the pain they suffer
              | at the point of death. How this compensation should be realized depends on some
              | technical issues and on the relative costs, which I cannot discuss here. Moreover,
              | it depends on an estimation of an animal’s prospects of suffering, which seem
              | very difficult to calculate individually and comparatively.18 Despite problems
              | with putting this idea into practice, doing so would certainly be feasible with
              | relatively minor changes to current methods of animal farming. To give an ex-
              | ample and a thumbnail criterion, it might be that ritually slaughtered animals
              | ought to be raised in larger pens or enjoy more freedom to roam.
              | Needless to say, the justification of this proposal depends on the supposition
              | that ritual slaughter is a necessary component of religious freedom and that we
              | cannot simply tell Muslims and Jews not to eat meat. In other words, this solu-
              | tion is acceptable only if ritual slaughter is necessary for the religious identity
              | of Jews and Muslims and if we are committed to an equal recognition of reli-
              | gious identities. If this condition does not obtain, we may simply require Mus-
              | lims and Jews to abandon the practice of ritual slaughter.
              | To meet this condition, it must be shown that religious identity and the in-
              | tegrity of believers would be violated if ritual slaughter were banned. But this
              | claim has to be justified, because religiously informed practices, as well as
              | other cultural practices, can change, and it is notoriously difficult and contro-
              | versial to distinguish between features of a cultural tradition that are essential
              | to it and other features whose suppression or change would not endanger its
              | continuation. Here I cannot discuss whether ritual slaughter is necessary for the
              | integrity and existence of Jewish and Muslim communities. Suffice it to say
              | that Muslim and Jewish communities bear at least a minimal burden of proof to
              | demonstrate this, in virtue of the fact that some Muslim communities seem to
              | 18 Although they concern the case of research on animals, the considerations provided by Bass
              | (2012, 93-6), pointing out the structural indeterminacy of such comparisons of utility func-
              | tions between humans and animals and among animals themselves, seem applicable here
              | and very convincing.
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 123
              | accept the religious validity of the requirement to stun animals before slaugh-
              | ter.19 This means that the overall permissibility of religious slaughter is subject
              | to an important condition, irrespective of whether we approve the idea of com-
              | pensating ritually slaughtered animals that I put forward. This conditional
              | qualification is important because it shows that the expression of religious
              | freedom needs to be balanced with other values too.
              | If we apply the principle of non-discrimination to animals and we overcome
              | the unjustified assumption that the method of killing is more important than the
              | method of raising animals, many objections to ritual slaughter may be lessened
              | or put aside. This is particularly the case for Paula Casal’s argument rejecting
              | the admissibility of exemptions from the ban on cruelty to animals on the
              | grounds of cultural and religious practices. Casal’s starting assumption is as
              | follows:
              | I shall avoid reliance on any extravagant assumptions concerning the moral sta-
              | tus of animals, nor shall I argue that animals have rights or that their suffering is
              | of equal moral importance to ours. […] I merely rely upon the modest assump-
              | tion, widely accepted by Western governments and citizens, that the existence of
              | anti-cruelty legislation is desirable. Such laws are not based on sectarian views,
              | but on the reasonable grounds that it is wrong to kill animals in painful ways
              | when alternative less painful methods are available, and that there are sound
              | moral reasons to enforce such a prohibition (Casal 2003, 2).
              | In general, Casal contends that there is no sufficiently weighty or important
              | interest that is capable of justifying cruelty to animals, even a need to protect
              | certain cultural practices. I do not want to reject her substantive claim, which
              | might of course be true. In general, however, it seems to me that her argument
              | would be at least displaced, if not rebutted, if ritually slaughtered animals were
              | treated better than non-ritually slaughtered animals, thus being compensated for
              | the extra suffering involved during their slaughter. In this way, a standard cri-
              | tique leveled against claims for cultural accommodation and differential treat-
              | ment would be neutralized. Indeed, one of the most troubling objections to
              | culturally-based differential treatment is that the beneficiaries of an exemption
              | or a special treatment seem to be advantaged with respect to those who are
              | compelled to abide by standard legal requirements.20 But, if animals suffering
              | more during slaughter are compensated, and no overall deviation from the
              | general concern for animal suffering is involved, the idea that ritual slaughter
              | entails a special treatment disappears. Thus, if ritually slaughtered animals are
              | 19 This is the case in Malaysia. See Department of Islamic Development Malaysia. 2011. Malay-

              | 20 The most forceful critique of culturally-based exemptions from the law and differential
              | treatment is outlined by Barry (2001). For a defense of a qualified and conditional account
              | of exemptions from the law on the basis of conscience see Ceva (2010). For a case-based
              | survey of the rule and exemption approach see Zuolo (2010).
              | HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 124
              | not disadvantaged with respect to non-ritually slaughtered ones, there seems to
              | be no need for a special justification of ritual slaughtering, because allowing it
              | would not be an expression of cruelty.21
              | 6.
              | Conclusion
              | To conclude, it is worth emphasizing that in this paper I have not defended
              | ritual slaughter in general. Its justification is deeply conditional on its necessity
              | for religious identities and on our commitment to the protection of religious
              | freedom. My aim in this paper, rather, was to show that it is possible to recon-
              | cile a concern for animal welfare and the right to freedom of religious expres-
              | sion by compensating the pain caused to ritually slaughtered animals with
              | better conditions during their lives. The advantage of this solution is that it
              | employs a principle of fairness towards animals as well as towards human
              | beings. It applies a principle of fairness to animals themselves because it com-
              | pensates the discrimination imposed by ritual slaughter. And it is also fair with
              | respect to human beings because it does not simply concede an exemption from
              | a general principle to two religious communities, but it also demands that they
              | treat the ritually slaughtered animals better, without asking them to change
              | their religious practice. Hence, such a solution seems to address the problems
              | faced by contemporary societies regarding the difficult accommodation of
              | minority claims in an environment of pluralistic values. This solution may
              | seem too biased, to some people, towards the status quo regarding the overall
              | treatment of animals, but it has the advantage of proposing a very feasible
              | improvement of the life of many animals.
              | 21 Claiming this, however, does not imply that we should also accept other cultural practices
              | such as Santeria rituals or bullfights, which Casal mentions.
