              | The woman’s life…
              | I
              | n modern societies, with technological advances, one can notice an increase in
              | survival of the population, where currently the life expectancy is increasing. It is known that
              | the exponential increase in survival is advent of advances over the years, the scientific and
              | technological methods in the intervention of the binomial health and disease.
              | Technological advances have also provided the surgical interventions, which has been
              | one of the alternatives for curing various diseases. The present study addressed the
              | adaptation of women in daily activities after undergoing mastectomy, correlating it with the
              | adaptive theory of Roy and the assistance provided by nursing professionals to these clients.
              | The Mastectomy is the surgical name that is given to removal of the breasts. This
              | procedure can be simple with only the removal of the breast tissue, breast quadrantectomy
              | parts of, or all, which is removed beyond the breast tissue, muscles, and regional lymph
              | nodes. Early detection of breast cancer makes possible an intervention with higher cure odds
              | and a better prognosis of doença.¹
              | The cancer epidemiology reveals that this is the second most common type in the
              | world, and the most common among women, accounting for 22% of new cases each year. If
              | diagnosed and treated in time, the prognosis is relatively good. In Brazil, breast cancer
              | mortality rates remain high, most likely because the disease is still diagnosed in advanced
              | stages. In the world population, the median survival after five years is 61%. Relatively rare
              | before age 35, above this age its incidence is growing fast and steadily. Statistics indicate an
              | increase in its incidence in developed countries and in developing countries. According to the
              | World Health Organization (WHO), in the 60s and 70s there was an 10-fold increase in
              | incidence rates adjusted for age in the population-based cancer registries of several
              | continents.¹
              | Breast cancer may be associated with physical carcinogens, chemical, biological or
              | hereditary; you know, therefore, the importance of mammograms for early detection of
              | breast cancer, where after diagnosis confirmed by biopsy the patient goes to undergo a
              | chemotherapeutic process, but currently the only treatment that aims to cure cancer is
              | surgical. When the cancer is identified to a woman with breast cancer experiences
              | psychological conflicts and emotional disturbances even before the chemotherapy, and when
              | it receives the news of the mastectomy impact on your life is very great because the breasts
              | are a visa agency for many companies as symbol of femininity, this woman can experience a
              | great inherent conflict due to own cultural factors which this is inserida.¹
              | The Sister Callista Roy adaptation model has been one of the most widely studied.

              | The woman’s life…
              | Began in the late 60 when Roy was a graduate course student at the University of California,
              | Los Angeles. His works were influenced by his training in social sciences and reflect an
              | individual posture while person.2 In his theory the first area of concern is the identity of those
              | who receive nursing care, may be a person, a group, a community or society. The idea of an
              | adaptation system combines the concepts of adaptation and Sistema.3
              | Roy describes the person as an adaptive system with inherent fighting mechanisms and
              | acquired that allows you to compete with the internal and external changes that occur to
              | him. Classifies such mechanisms as regulators or innate, those whose response is automatic
              | and resulting from neural activities, chemical and endocrine mechanisms and recognizers or
              | acquired, those whose answer is given by cognitive / emotional channels, is behavior resulting
              | from learning experiência.²
              | The humanistic values of the Roy Adaptation Model are its definition of the purpose or
              | specific nursing goal. Human existence is seen as dynamic and intencional³. The person is
              | respected as creative and active in using their nursing process and as an active participant in
              | your care. The purpose of nursing to adapt contributes to the health of the individual and the
              | unity and solidarity of the person, within its self in relation to others.4
              | A longer description of the internal processes of the person as an adaptive system, Roy
              | sets the effectors systems. The four modes are effectors or adaptive physiological function,
              | self-concept, role function and interdependence. The behavior related to the ways is the
              | manifestation of adaptive level of the person, and reflects the use of coping mechanisms.
              | Through observation of the person's behavior with regard to adaptive modes, the nurse can
              | identify adaptive or inefficient responses in health situations and doença.³
              | The work was based on adaptive theory of Roy, in which the author describes that
              | human beings can adapt to different situations, stimuli and environments, that is, had the
              | object of investigation the process of adaptation in women with mastectomies correlating it
              | to Roy's adaptation theory, and the assistance provided by the nursing professional in the pre,
              | during and after surgery.
              | Thus, for better depth in this study the following objectives were outlined: verify the
              | methods of adaptation of women with mastectomies and correlate the adaptive process
              | exposed the woman to the theory by Roy; raise the presence of changes in a woman's life
              | habits after mastectomy; determine the care provided by nurses to women with
              | mastectomies.

              | Marital Status: Unmarried 25%, 25% Married 25% Wives and Widows 25%.
              | Through the survey it was found that the findings broken down by percentage were
              | dissimilar. Thus, our research has all civil states existing in Brazil (single, married, divorced
              | and widowed), has uniformity among women with 50% occupancy for those without
              | occupation 50% and also has different levels of educational background.
              | After verification of the socio-demographic profile, began the preparation of the
              | analytical categories.
              | Given the primary objective of the study, this emerged from the question that sought
              | to reveal what the reactions that the woman presented from the diagnosis of cancer, the
              | following results were found:
              | There are differences between the interviewees' discourse, where the meaning of
              | cancer for women can be directly associated with death, due to the nature of the problem;
              | may feel sad wanting to cry and be alone or have a quiet and / or impartial reaction.
              | Noted in the account of deponents who was at diagnosis fear of the impact that
              | represents the disease in their lives and misunderstanding of the meaning of the disease, as
              | well as detect reactions unbiased view of the diagnosis of the disease. We also observed the
              | first adaptive reactions, where this first moment (moment diagnosis of breast cancer) the
              | report of the women 01, 02 and 03 showed negative reactions; Roy classifies "negative
              | response to the stimulus," the woman 04 showed a reaction of tranquility "positive response
              | to the stimulus."
              | "Facing the diagnosis of breast cancer, the woman experiences feelings of fear,
              | sadness and denial" 6 In the urgency of view as having a disease that threatens life, which
              | causes him uncertainty about what will happen with you and future , the person starts to
              | interact with death. Interactions with death also occur in the form of direct association
              | between having cancer and being condemned to die.7
              | The cancer has stigmatizing character, is seen as synonymous with death and causes
              | painful transformations in the life of mulher.8 internal and external changes, that is, input
              | stimuli, are in contact with the person's coping state, where the level of the person adaptation
              | will determine whether or not elicited a positive response to internal stimuli and externos.³
              | The fact that it is found, at a certain time, with cancer, stage which means a
              | movement that begins with taking knowledge that has this disease, since there are early
              | indications that clarification and the decision of what to do from that momento.7
              | So it should be noted that, at the time a person is diagnosed with cancer, she needs
              | time to think, time to organize ideas, so that it can find a better solution for dealing with
              | problems. "The interaction with these means may be decisive for the attribution of meaning
              | and the definition of the situation, orientation to action taken by the person7.The study of
              | the following statements is exemplified:
              | "The record cost to fall, I was standing looking at the doctor's face, no reaction, then
              | I started to cry, only after two years that I began to understand better." Woman 01

              | "She wanted to be alone, away from it all, not as depression, but with the feeling of
              | being in line to death." 02 Women
              | "It was the worst possible reactions, because I thought I could die even though the
              | chances of a cure." Woman 03
              | "There are about twenty years ago, I noticed a lump to palpate my breast so I went
              | to see a doctor, this referred me immediately to be biopsy, then came the diagnosis of
              | cancer, it happened so fast, I did not feel any pain, I was very quiet, only stopped to think
              | and reason about my life, that's all, people around me were more concerned with the disease
              | than me. I mastectomies and I was fine, at least for another eighteen years. Two years ago
              | I began to feel a lot of back pain, I again call the doctor, then came the diagnosis of
              | recurrence, and now the cancer is not only within, it has spread to the bones and it was, I
              | was quiet too, I think everything that happens has a purpose, but this time is different feel
              | much pain, cancer will not let me forget he's there. But I'm not sad, I feel good, sometimes
              | I thought I had to pretend to be sad to please the people who were around me, I am a quiet
              | person and I ask the same to my family, they are also quiet. The only time I was really upset
              | was the day I took the prescription to kill the car tax, which was written - patient in
              | palliative care - I think that day, the first time skin, I had real confidence in knowing that it
              | will not end up in a month or two, but something bigger, longer" Woman 04
              | Given the second objective of the study was to identify the date that had been held
              | mastectomy, the study reached the following result: The age groups with the highest
              | incidence of cancer among the women interviewed comprise between 40 to 50 years, and
              | confirmed the need for clinical breast examination after age 40, which is understood as part
              | of comprehensive care to women's health. The deponent 04, reports recurrence of the disease
              | with bone metastasis, thus we highlight the importance of performing diagnostic tests at
              | intervals for those who have experienced the disease and out mastectomizado due to disease
              | relapse possibilities.
              | Mastectomy is a procedure used to prevent the spread of cancer mama.9 So from these
              | data it is understood that soon diagnosed cancer, according to its staging, the surgical
              | procedure was performed. These data enable the identification of the age groups with the
              | highest incidence of breast cancer, thus serving as a subsidy to develop prevention strategies

              | The woman’s life…
              | It was noticed that the reports of respondents there were differences at diagnosis
              | (time of challenge), and 50% had acceptance reactions (positive feedback); 25% did not
              | believe at first, skepticism about the diagnosis (negative responses) and 25% had mixed
              | reactions of refreshment and pain before the procedure (neutral). Parameters being used
              | with the time of diagnosis of mastectomy as (time stimulus) the word "accept" as a (positive
              | reaction), the words "not accept" as (negative reactions) and other responses were classified
              | as neutral. These results were found using the following endpoint:
              | Time of diagnosis of mastectomy = time stimulus
              | Rejection = negative reactions;
              | Acceptance = positive reactions;
              | Other responses = neutral.
              | The reaction to the possibility of being with cancer can also be expressed by a not
              | believe, looking itself for evidence that depart from the idea that is in danger and that return,
              | at least temporarily, the lost tranquility "to not believe this is really happening "as well as
              | the positive reactions" will be released as soon as possible than to disturb "7 The attitude of
              | thinking is an internal brainstorming exercise where they can be convinced" to accept the
              | conditions and possibilities of the form of treatment chosen, pondering the urgent need to
              | treat in order to prevent the spread of the disease and the need to undergo more invasive
              | and / or radicais.7
              | Therefore the activity of thinking (brainstorming exercise) can help women to accept
              | the proposed therapy. The professional of health, can act indirectly, explaining all procedures
              | to be performed, showing the possible surgical benefits. Reinforcing this argument, the
              | statements were extracted:
              | "I accepted" woman 01
              | "I did not believe at first, wanted to look for other solutions, each query expect a
              | different answer." Woman 02
              | "It was very fast the time has come between the diagnosis and the diagnosis of
              | mastectomy, I accepted, I was quiet, the doctor on the day of my surgery told me something
              | in my memory - I'm just an instrument where that only through God and his power that we
              | will win this obstacle." Women 04
              | Also according to the same purpose search reached a second result: The woman before
              | mastectomy diagnosis may be uncertain reactions because the surgery is the possibility of
              | cure while the mutilation of a body part of a feminine characteristic.
              | Roy's theory "allows us to recognize people by stimuli can trigger responses, sometimes
              | positive and negative in others, in stressful situations.11" Given the evidence of neutral
              | responses, we disagree with the theory proposed by Roy, appearing then the question before
              | the report "Mixing and pain relief" woman 03. How to measure this reaction was adaptive or
              | ineffective? Thus one can conclude that neutral responses when generating conflict between
              | something that may be good and bad at the same time, and do not generate replies, or
              | positive or negative even for a short period of time, occurring after a hit, negative.
              | Reinforcing the above analysis it follows the statement:
              | "It was a mixture of relief and pain. On the one hand there was the possibility of
              | ending this disease and the other had the pain of losing a part of my body that would take

              | Given the fourth objective of the study was to identify the presence of any limitations
              | in daily life of these women, the study behind as a result: The main problems presented by
              | the deponents were related to shoulder movements; the impossibility of use of accessories,
              | low-cut clothes and change in daily routine.
              | “It was noticed in the account of deponents that 75% of women have a physical
              | disability, 25% reported psychological limitation, "is very difficult to accept the loss of a part
              | in my body, even after all this time I had the surgery" woman 03. Complementing the subject
              | the article published by the Brazilian Journal of Nursing "This shame image is exacerbated,
              | particularly for the mutilation of a body part, one of the main symbols of female identity.8"
              | After excision or mastectomy radiation and the adjacent axillary lymph nodes, the
              | patient may develop shoulder mobility limitations, particularly in the shoulder flexion and
              | abduction and adduction movements and combined extensão.12
              | The causes of limitation of shoulder joint range may be different: Source limitation
              | really articulate, limitation due to muscle stiffness, lastly painful limitation in the individual
              | limits movement aiming the joint reaches the range that triggers the sensations
              | nociceptivas.13
              | There may be pain and muscle spasm in the neck and shoulder as a result of reflex
              | muscle protection. The levator muscle of the scapula, teres major and minor and infra-
              | spinouts are usually tender to palpation and may restrict the mobility of active ombro.4
              | The reduction in the use of the upper limb after surgery involved predisposes the
              | patient to the development of chronic frozen shoulder and increases the likelihood of lymph
              | edema in hand and braço.9
              | The upper limb lymph edema is a frequent consequence in breast surgery plus
              | axillary’s dissection. One third of patients treated for breast tumors develop lymph edema,
              | the severity of which varies and may be mild or very severe, leading to functional constraints,
              | aesthetic problems, and even profissionais.13
              | Lymph edema develops from an imbalance between demand and capacity lymphatic
              | system draining lymph. The proteins of high molecular weight are outside into the
              | interstitium. Increasing the concentration of protein in the vascular means generates changes
              | in osmotic pressure, and results in the ultimate presence in the interstitial fluid that is the
              | linfedema.13
              | It is noticed that all the women interviewed reported some difficulties to deal with
              | the limitations imposed by breast surgery, the respondents experience the difficulties of
              | adapting to a new reality, thus complementing the matter Roy describes the person as "an

text          | Given the sixth goal of the study, which emerged from the need to evaluate the care
              | provided by nursing professionals’ pre, during and after surgery, the study reached the
              | following results: Unprepared of the nursing care professional to act following a surgical

              | There were differences in the assessment of care provided by nursing professionals;

              | it seems that they were not trained for this type of surgery, I was not prepared for a hospital,

              | Given the seventh goal of the study aimed to understand the feeling of women today
              | (simultaneously) after mastectomy, bringing as a result: Adaptation is continuous
              | The reports of the interviewees reveal that the accordance after the cancer is
              | possible, 50% of them report that the end of treatment was more acceptable, 25% reported a
              | reduction in self-esteem, but are trying to adapt to the new reality and 25% even in care
              | palliative show up well. We agree with Roy at this point, where it describes that "the constant
              | interaction of people with their environment is characterized by internal and external
              | changes. In this changing world people need to maintain its own integrity; that is, each person
              | continuously adapts4”. For better understanding we extract the following statements:
              | "I learned a lot with cancer, I had a lesson in my life, I now accepted all better
              | understand each other better." Woman 01
              | "Well, I never had problems, today it's all normal.” Women 02

              | enjoying every moment, without worrying too much about tomorrow." Woman 04
              | Finally the study showed that it is essential that women stop and make an inner
              | reflection exercise in diagnostic moments, and then find the best choices. As for the
              | correlation with Roy theory there were times when we differ than she proposes, and there
              | were times that we agree with the proposed theory. The professional nursing in preoperative
              | care is of vital importance at the time of breast surgery the woman is involved in multiple
              | thoughts, which can be positive or negative, and then the nurse should calm her, explain the
              | procedures to be performed and pay attention- for expected problems.

              | It is appropriate to note that in this study, it was very clear evidence of adaptive
              | reactions. In the first analysis of categories can be observed negative reactions, which are
              | directly related to the diagnosis of cancer, where evidence of a disease that threatens the
              | lives leads many women to react negatively, in which Roy classifies as a "negative response
              | to the stimulus." Cancer in women's view is a disease that is directly associated with death,
              | become so frightening stage for these.
              | We found disease recurrence reports with bone metastasis, thus we highlight the
              | importance of performing diagnostic tests at intervals for those who have experienced the
              | disease and out mastectomizado due to disease recurrence probabilities.
              | The time of diagnosis of mastectomy is another point to be questioned, there are
              | women who do not accept the principle surgery, trying to look for other solutions; some
              | readily accept without question and others have neutral responses, because for these surgery
              | is the possibility of cure while the mutilation of a body part, a feminine characteristics thus
              | disagree with the theory proposed by Roy, where we believe that a person can generate
              | neutral responses at the time of conflict between something that can be good and bad at the
              | same time, so do not generate responses, either positively or negatively; even for a short
              | period of time, occurring after a positive or negative response.
              | The physical limitation after mastectomy was widely discussed in the study, most of
              | the women had some limitation of physical, the main problems were related to shoulder
              | movements; the impossibility of use of accessories, low-cut clothes and change in daily
              | routine. Roy in his studies believe that the adaptive process is continuous, which leads us to
              | think that women can take years or even a lifetime, to adapt to the new reality.
              | During the research there were reports of loss of self-esteem and a great difficulty
              | dealing with the loss of the breast, according to Roy featuring a "negative response to the
              | stimulus." Family and religiosity were reported during the survey, these are very important in
              | the whole process favoring adaptive reactions; however, our research was to feature the
              | evaluation of individual adaptive process, i.e., the representatively of cancer to the woman
              | and not the family processes.

              | differences in the assessment of care provided by nursing professionals, case reports that
              | characterized the action of these as positive 50%, neglect of case reports 25% and 25%
              | reported changing the professional attitude over the years. From these results lead us to think
              | that nurses need to be trained better for their professional performance.
              | We completed the research revealing that there were few inefficient or negative
              | responses by stimuli. We agree with Roy for believing that the person continuously adapts,

              | period of time, occurring after a positive or negative response. We emphasize that develop
