              | The publication of Democratic Politics in the European Parliament (Hix et al.,
              | 2007) presents a welcome opportunity to reﬂect on the signiﬁcant advances
              | that have been made in recent years in the study of legislative organization
              | in the EP. It allows us to examine the present state of this ﬁeld and to identify
              | some areas that remain under-researched and even neglected in current
              | research agendas. In and of itself, any study that so forcefully and convinc-
              | ingly confronts the conventional wisdom that the European Parliament (EP)
              | is an ineffectual, irrelevant institution deserves a wide readership. However,
              | this book represents much more than simply a study of legislative behaviour
              | in the only directly elected European Union (EU) institution. It addresses
              | much larger questions about the origins of political parties and party disci-
              | pline, the nature of party competition and the potential for representative
              | democracy in a complex political environment. This book will be of interest
              | not just to those immersed in the political system of the EP but also to party
              | scholars and legislative watchers more generally and indeed even to demo-
              | cratic theorists concerned about the possibility for representative democracy
              | in the EU.
              | The ﬁeld of legislative politics has long been dominated by studies of the
              | United States Congress. This congressional research has generated a remark-
              | able body of scholarship, which has remained largely untested beyond the
              | congressional experience for too long. In the past decade however, there has
              | been a conscious and concerted effort on the part of EP scholars, led in no

              | small part by the authors of this book, to extend these theories into a com-
              | parative context. This book represents a very deliberate effort to connect
              | legislative studies of the European Parliament to this wider body of literature
              | and to shake off the mantle of the ‘sui generis’ approach that has frequently
              | and regrettably governed EU studies.
              | The overarching argument running through this book is that political
              | groups in the European Parliament have become fully institutionalized; they
              | dominate decision-making and are very similar animals to their national
              | counterparts. The bulk of the book is dedicated to demonstrating that the
              | political groups have become increasingly cohesive over time and that politics
              | in the Parliament has been ‘normalized’, in that party competition is along
              | ideological rather than territorial dimensions. An impressive amount of data,
              | both quantitative and qualitative, is marshalled to convincingly demonstrate
              | the validity of these arguments, and the book’s contribution to legislative
              | studies and EU politics is indisputable. The book combines theoretical rigour
              | with equally rigorous and systematic testing of the main hypotheses and it
              | greatly enriches and advances our understanding of the political dynamics
              | that operate within the European Parliament.
              | The ﬁrst three chapters of the book present the theoretical framework for
              | the analysis that follows. Chapter three in particular deserves close reading; it
              | is here that the main theoretical argument is developed. The authors theorize
              | that, contrary to conventional wisdom, we should not expect to observe terri-
              | torial politics in action in the European Parliament. They hypothesize that
              | territorial conﬂicts are devolved to lower levels of decision-making within a
              | federal structure where they can be resolved most efﬁciently. However, certain
              | conﬂicts (particularly economic ones) generate inefﬁciencies if resolved at the
              | territorial level and that power in these policy areas is best retained at the
              | federal level. The theory thus predicts that party competition should be along
              | ideological dimensions within federal chambers and the remainder of the book
              | is concerned with ﬁnding conﬁrmatory evidence to this effect. Chapters four
              | and ﬁve present empirical evidence that participation rates in voting have
              | increased over time and that cohesion has risen concomitantly with the
              | increasing powers of the Parliament itself. Chapter six examines whether or
              | not political group control of the agenda is sufﬁcient to enforce party disci-
              | pline. Chapter seven considers the tension that may come to bear on members
              | of the European Parliament (MEPs) when there is a conﬂict of interests
              | between their national party and their EP political group. Chapters eight
              | and nine examine the ideological structure of political competition in the EP,
              | with the former focusing on coalition formation and the latter on the dimen-
              | sionality of the policy space that is evident in voting behaviour. The ﬁnal two
              | chapters provide detailed and rich case studies of recent controversial and
              | McElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?
              | 4 3 5
              | high-stake votes, the ‘sacking’ of the Santer Commission and the takeover
              | directive, to complement the analysis in chapters four to nine. One could dwell
              | in detail on the many merits of this ﬁne book, but the achievements of the
              | authors will be obvious to any reader and summarizing them thus seems
              | redundant. Therefore it is more productive to explore in the remainder of this
              | forum piece some of the analytical issues this book raises and the questions
              | and challenges it poses for legislative scholars and students of the EP in
              | particular.
              | Roll call votes
              | The study of legislative behaviour in Congress has relied heavily on the
              | analyses of roll call votes (RCVs) and the inﬂuence of this body of scholar-
              | ship is evident throughout this book. It is not too radical to claim that the
              | study of legislative behaviour has been transformed in the past two decades
              | by these analytical techniques. Legislative voting records clearly provide very
              | important information about legislative behaviour, voting cohesiveness and
              | perhaps, though more controversially, ideological preferences. Democratic
              | Politics in the European Parliament represents the culmination of an ambitious
              | and formidable data-collection exercise in this tradition. By collecting all roll
              | call votes in the European Parliament since 1979 the authors have made an
              | extremely valuable contribution to legislative and EU studies. Already the
              | data set is being widely used by scholars around the world to various ends.
              | Our understanding of legislative behaviour in the EP has been and will
              | continue to be greatly enhanced by the application to this setting of the tech-
              | nical tools developed for Congress. But roll call votes also have limitations
              | and future scholars who make use of this rich data set must be aware of,
              | acknowledge and correct for the problems associated with their use.
              | Unlike the US experience, not all votes in the EP are by roll call and this
              | generates signiﬁcant questions about the representative characteristics of the
              | samples we observe. Currently roll calls number around one-third of all votes,
              | and we still know too little about the process by which roll calls are
              | generated to conclude that this is a random sample from the universe of all
              | votes. Roll calls in the EP may be corrupted by strategic considerations, which
              | will affect the inferences we can draw from them. Indeed, even where all votes
              | are recorded by roll call, the range of vote choices and therefore outcomes
              | will be limited by the inﬂuence of pre-ﬂoor stages of legislative preparation
              | as well as by decisions regarding the ﬂoor agenda (Lawrence et al., 2006).
              | Thus, even where members have permission to vote according to their
              | conscience during plenary sessions, parties (particularly those with a
              | 4 3 6
              | European Union Politics 8(3)
              | majority) may constrain members’ voting behaviour by controlling the
              | legislative agenda. This issue aside, the more pressing and challenging
              | difﬁculty with the use of RCVs in the EP is that the majority of votes go
              | unrecorded.
              | Hix et al. (2007: 30) hold that it is not unreasonable to assume that roll call
              | votes are requested on the most important issues in the EP. But preliminary
              | research (Carrubba et al., 2006) on votes in the ﬁfth Parliament (1999–2004)
              | suggest that roll calls are disproportionately called on resolutions rather than
              | under the co-decision procedure. Thus, legislatively consequential votes are
              | under-sampled, which may run counter to the argument that roll calls are
              | called on the most important votes. If the assumption of importance is
              | weakened, does this affect the inferences we draw? How might this over-
              | representation of votes on non-legislative issues affect our conﬁdence in
              | cohesion indices or NOMINATE scores? With regard to cohesion, the
              | direction of bias introduced by the over-sampling of non-legislative votes is
              | not by any means obvious. On the one hand, this underrepresentation of
              | legislative votes in the roll call sample may bias the levels of cohesion down-
              | wards. If most roll call votes are of little legislative consequence, do political
              | groups bother expending limited resources on whipping party members into
              | line? On the other hand, as the authors demonstrate in chapter four,
              | attendance at roll call votes goes up with the legislative importance of the vote.
              | Is it the case that only the most loyal, career-minded MEPs turn up for votes
              | on resolutions? This may have the effect of inﬂating the actual levels of
              | cohesion of political groups in the EP, if such votes are over-sampled. Yet
              | another possibility is that the lower turnout on resolutions reﬂects the fact that
              | only those truly interested turn up, and that the subset of votes thus reﬂects
              | the interests of preference outliers. We do not know the answers to such
              | questions; it may very well be that attendance rates or legislative signiﬁcance
              | are not related systematically to levels of cohesion. The countervailing
              | dynamics that potentially exist here suggest some interesting questions that
              | future analysts mining this data set will need to consider.
              | The authors further document that the number of roll calls has increased
              | dramatically over time, which may in part diminish the importance of the
              | above questions; as the number of votes increases, their representative nature
              | is likely to improve. But do these varying levels of roll calls give rise to
              | additional concerns about cross-parliamentary comparisons? There were
              | fewer than 900 roll calls in the ﬁrst Parliament (1979–84), compared with over
              | 5000 in the ﬁfth (1999–2004). Can we have the same conﬁdence in the results
              | drawn from the much smaller samples in the early Parliaments as we do in
              | those from the fourth and ﬁfth Parliaments?
              | A more general shortcoming of the NOMINATE procedure is that it does
              | not typically provide uncertainty estimates (such as standard errors and
              | McElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?
              | 4 3 7
              | conﬁdence intervals). This may lead to a false sense of precision for those who
              | use the scores.1 A particular problem that does not seem to be of concern in
              | the congressional literature but may be more relevant in the European Parlia-
              | ment context is the large variation in member participation rates in roll calls.
              | In a given Parliament, some MEPs vote thousands of times whereas others
              | vote a mere handful of times. This reﬂects high absentee rates, comparatively
              | large turnover rates in membership between elections and, more worryingly
              | perhaps, strategic absences (not to be confused with ofﬁcial abstentions). For
              | instance, in the current Parliament many of the new members from East
              | European countries have particularly poor voting records. We can obtain
              | NOMINATE scores with as few as 20 votes, but it is problematic if one MEP’s
              | scores are calculated with 1600 votes and the scores of another with only 40
              | when no uncertainty estimates are generated.
              | To interpret the scores that are generated by NOMINATE as preference
              | measures is common practice in congressional work, primarily because it is
              | one measure of something unobservable that lies at the heart of much of what
              | we, as political scientists, are interested in. The authors of this book largely,
              | and judiciously, shy away from this particular interpretation in the context of
              | the EP, though the data they have generated may unwisely be utilized to this
              | end by others. The argument sustained throughout this book very much indi-
              | cates that these are not party-free measures of preferences and should not be
              | used as proxies for ideology. Nevertheless, preferences need to be approxi-
              | mated if we are to test theories of legislative decision-making or address
              | questions about whether or not key parliamentary bodies such as committees
              | are representative agents of their principal (Parliament). Alternative measures
              | such as elite surveys suffer from serious sample response issues, and even
              | this aside there is no actual obligation on those who respond to be truthful.
              | Measures based on constituency characteristics , which have proved popular
              | in the USA, are also problematic given the very vague notion of constituency
              | in the EP. One ﬁnal possibility is to make use of the recent interest group
              | ratings from organizations such as Friends of the Earth, though again these
              | suffer from small sample size issues and may exaggerate extremism and
              | bipolarity (Snyder, 1992). There is clearly no silver bullet solution to the
              | preference measurement problem that legislative scholars confront, but cross-
              | validation of the various measures is recommended.
              | Similarly, testing spatial models of legislative behaviour fundamentally
              | depends on our ability to accurately gauge the number and nature of the politi-
              | cal dimensions on which parties compete. The authors’ analysis of roll call
              | voting in chapter nine demonstrates that there are broadly two dimensions on
              | which the political groups compete and that these dimensions have been
              | relatively stable over time. The ﬁrst dimension fairly conclusively maps a
              | general left–right policy dimension, which lends weight to the overall
              | 4 3 8
              | European Union Politics 8(3)
              | argument that party competition is deﬁned ideologically rather than terri-
              | torially. But the second dimension, the authors readily admit, is more difﬁcult
              | to interpret substantively. It may represent some European-level govern-
              | ment–opposition dynamics and/or a pro-EU integration versus anti-EU
              | integration dimension. The interpretation of dimensions relies primarily on a
              | researcher’s substantive knowledge but may be complicated in the case of the
              | EP if selection biases are evident in roll call votes. Again the question of the
              | representativeness of roll calls is fundamental here. If RCVs are not repre-
              | sentative by issue area, this may affect the conclusions we draw about the
              | nature of the policy space. If roll calls are called disproportionately in certain
              | policy domains, this may lead to the overemphasis of particular dimensions
              | of conﬂict in NOMINATE-type analysis.
              | Carrubba et al. (2006) suggest that a degree of caution is required in the
              | interpretation of and generalization from roll calls in the European Parliament.
              | Overall, their work ﬁnds evidence for pooling concerns, the asymmetric use
              | of roll calls under different legislative procedures and the calling of RCVs
              | disproportionately by particular political groups (notably the Greens) and in
              | particular issue areas. More work on disaggregated votes may lead to in-
              | teresting ﬁndings; pooling RCVs on co-decisions with those on resolutions
              | may not be ideal without ﬁrst knowing for certain that they are generated by
              | the same processes and whether they experience the same degree of whipping.
              | None of this is to argue that the use of roll calls should be abandoned but
              | rather their use necessitates explicit consideration of the process by which roll
              | calls are produced. In addition, disaggregating votes by issue area might prove
              | a fruitful exercise: for instance, does the subsample of votes on environmental
              | issues lead to a clear green policy dimension emerging? More work on compar-
              | ing the sample of roll calls to the universe of actual (and indeed potential)
              | votes would greatly enhance our conﬁdence in the inferences we draw. Overall
              | these issues suggest that the analysis of roll call votes has much potential.
              | There is clearly scope for further development of roll call analyses through the
              | use of more sophisticated techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain
              | (MCMC) modelling, which also generates uncertainty estimates. In conclusion,
              | the contribution of Hix et al. (2007) via the data set, which accompanies the
              | book, cannot be overestimated.
              | Moving beyond the ﬂoor
              | Despite the particular issues that arise with the use of RCVs in the EP, it is
              | convincingly demonstrated over the course of this book that the political
              | groups in the European Parliament have become increasingly cohesive over
              | McElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?
              | 4 3 9
              | time. A crucial question that the work thus motivates is how such unity is
              | created. Political parties in established democracies typically exhibit such
              | high levels of cohesion that the question of how such discipline has arisen
              | has, until recently, received little attention (Bowler et al., 1999). In emerging
              | legislatures, however, the process of transforming rudimentary party organiz-
              | ations into disciplined parties is not inevitable. What mechanisms are used
              | to achieve this end? How party discipline arises and how it is maintained are
              | central questions of interest in legislative studies. Our knowledge of these
              | topics, however, suffers from substantial gaps, especially with regard to the
              | practice of party discipline outside the relatively familiar Anglo-American
              | setting.
              | If we are fully to disentangle the concepts of ideological afﬁnity and party
              | discipline, we need to look beyond the voting behaviour of MEPs. A party
              | that is cohesive because of an afﬁnity of ideological viewpoints and a
              | party that is cohesive because its members are whipped into line are obser-
              | vationally equivalent when one restricts one’s analysis solely to ﬂoor voting.
              | Krehbiel (1993) has put the argument for afﬁnity mostly forcefully, arguing
              | that parties merely reﬂect their members’ preferences; they provide neither
              | structure nor constraint. He posits that legislative outcomes (via voting) are
              | not the product of parliamentary party discipline but rather reﬂect the distri-
              | bution of preferences of the party’s members.
              | The challenge of creating cohesive political parties is not trivial in the
              | European Parliament. The literature on party discipline tends to focus on
              | electoral incentives as a means of inducing party loyalty, but the European
              | Parliament provides a particularly interesting case study because these
              | inducements are very weak, if not entirely missing. To the extent that
              | electoral incentives shape much of the behaviour of political actors, the politi-
              | cal groups in the European Parliament are clearly greatly disadvantaged
              | when compared with their national counterparts. They do not control access
              | to the electoral ballot, they do not have resources to ﬁnance election
              | campaigns and, additionally, MEPs need not fear that rebellious behaviour
              | will force early elections. Although the prospects for cohesion appear quite
              | bleak, the book by Hix et al. (2007) demonstrates quite persuasively that this
              | has not been the experience of the political groups in the EP. Given the highly
              | constrained environment in which the political groups operate, how can we
              | account for the rise in political group cohesion? The ﬁndings of this book
              | motivate many questions that perhaps can be answered only by closer
              | examination of the activities of MEPs both within their political groups and
              | within the committee system.
              | A system of credible sanctions and rewards is one means of resolving the
              | collective dilemmas that all parties face. Do these sanctions and rewards exist
              | 4 4 0
              | European Union Politics 8(3)
              | internally to the EP and are they systematically used to punish and reward
              | party defectors and loyalists? It is almost certainly the case that intra-
              | parliamentary incentives to encourage cohesion operate in all legislative
              | bodies, but often these are overshadowed by electoral considerations. The
              | study of party discipline in the European Parliament allows legislative
              | scholars more neatly to isolate the internal and electoral factors in an actor’s
              | motivation structure, with implications for the general study of legislative
              | behaviour. The European Parliament offers scholars a particularly good case
              | study for demonstrating the importance of internal advancement in a politi-
              | cal actor’s motivations, because it is one of the few contexts in which the
              | electoral connection is not clearly dominant. One obvious avenue of research
              | is to examine whether or not those who vote against the party are sanctioned
              | via the loss of valuable ofﬁces within the Parliament or the political group
              | structure. Does the committee system, for instance, provide the political
              | groups with an important source of patronage, in addition to acting as a
              | source of policy expertise? As is the case with the US Congress, and increas-
              | ingly with a wide variety of legislatures across the world, committees are the
              | lifeblood of the European Parliament. The political groups have played a
              | crucial and very deliberate role in the organization of parliamentary
              | committees from the outset. In particular, the committee assignment process
              | is controlled by political groups rather than through a seniority-type norm as
              | in the US Congress. In addition, there is a clear hierarchy of committees, with
              | committee prestige largely determined by the degree of legislative powers the
              | EP has in a given policy jurisdiction. Positions on these high-status
              | committees are very much sought after by ambitious MEPs. This hierarchy
              | of prestige and control of the assignment process grants the party leaders
              | some power vis-à-vis individual MEPs. Not only has the committee system
              | expanded to provide ‘jobs for the boys’, but control over the committee
              | assignment process and committee chairs has been strongly tightened over
              | the years. In general, the career trajectories of MEPs and how these relate to
              | their behaviour on the ﬂoor (if at all) offers some wonderful research oppor-
              | tunities for future legislative scholars. How do MEPs’ career expectations
              | inﬂuence their legislative behaviour and, in turn, how does this behaviour
              | impact on their future career trajectories?
              | On a related note, the question of who controls the MEPs – national
              | parties or political groups – is addressed in chapter seven. The evidence here
              | suggests that members vote with their political group most of the time, but
              | there is also evidence of voting against the political group in favour of a
              | member’s national delegation when the two do not coincide. On a minor
              | statistical note, it is worth considering that in any group versus subgroup
              | comparison one is ‘virtually guaranteed to ﬁnd that subgroups are more
              | McElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?
              | 4 4 1
              | cohesive than groups’ (Desposato, 2003: 281), especially when subgroups are
              | small, as is the case with many national delegations. The overall result that
              | national parties are MEPs’ principal is a little disquieting because it suggests
              | that political groups are not as fully institutionalized or as powerful as
              | cohesion scores taken at face value might indicate. Interesting questions arise
              | about the nature of the relationship between national parties and their parent
              | political groups. Is the political group more than the sum of its national
              | parties? Are some national parties more privileged than others in the politi-
              | cal group structure, perhaps as a function of size? Can fully institutionalized
              | national political parties be conceived of as similar to factions within the
              | supranational political group? One obvious question that needs to be
              | addressed further is whether or not national delegations are given
              | exemptions by their political group on certain votes. This may occur for
              | instance when matters of national importance are at stake and/or the national
              | party’s vote does not affect the overall success or failure of the ballot. Overall,
              | the results in this chapter motivate some fascinating questions about what
              | happens when there is incongruence between the policy positions of national
              | delegations and those of the political group.
              | Agenda control
              | Chapter six of the book examines the impact of agenda-setting powers on
              | cohesion levels but ﬁnds little evidence to support this hypothesis. The authors
              | conclude that ‘parties in the European Parliament have only a limited oppor-
              | tunity to use their agenda setting powers to control the voting behaviour of
              | their backbench members’ (Hix et al., 2007: 130). Part of the problem with this
              | type of proposition and analysis is the great difﬁculty of capturing and measur-
              | ing the concept of agenda control in cross-sectional statistical models. Given
              | the proportional norms that govern procedural matters inside the EP, the effect
              | of agenda-setting powers will be conditional on party size, though clearly the
              | two issues are conceptually distinct. The results in chapter six are on the whole
              | weak, the explained variance of the models, despite the inclusion of upwards
              | of 20 variables, ranges between 1% and 4%. These models are clearly not
              | explaining a great deal, even though some individual coefﬁcients are signiﬁ-
              | cant. The question arises of whether or not the measures utilized are really
              | capturing agenda-setting powers. Do we reject the hypothesis that agenda-
              | setting powers are not very important in explaining cohesion levels in the EP,
              | or do we accept the ancillary hypothesis that the measures for such complex
              | concepts as agenda-setting are imprecise? Measurement is the challenge for
              | future scholars, and perhaps a complementary approach that examines the
              | 4 4 2
              | European Union Politics 8(3)
              | historical struggles over agenda-setting powers within the Parliament would
              | be worth pursuing. In addition, recent work by Schneider et al. (2006) high-
              | lights the need for better models of EU decision-making in general, particu-
              | larly models that incorporate the consensual norms that are the hallmark of
              | EU politics.
              | Empirical research into battles over the organization of the Parliament
              | and the evolution of the rules of procedure has been surprisingly limited and
              | mostly anecdotal to date. Apart from work by Williams (1995) and Kreppel
              | (2002), there is little critical analysis of the internal evolution of the Parlia-
              | ment.2 In the period 1979–2007 considerably more than 1000 rule changes
              | were proposed by the various Rules Committees. The volume of procedural
              | proposals is noteworthy; a great deal of parliamentary time has been dedi-
              | cated to structuring the institution. The formal rules of the legislative game
              | inside the European Parliament have been highly contested over the course
              | of the past 30 years, which would indicate that agenda-setting powers are not
              | perceived as irrelevant by the main actors. Procedural matters may not be of
              | pressing concern in legislatures that possess a large and disciplined majority
              | (Binder, 1997), but where such conditions are absent, as in the EP, legislative
              | rules become important tools for actors who wish to build and sustain stable
              | and cohesive parties. The history of the European Parliament is marked by
              | lengthy battles over what appear to be organizational minutiae. The amount
              | of effort and parliamentary time devoted to changing rules does not accord
              | with a non-partisan account of procedural choice. As Willi Rothley
              | commented in plenary in 1993, ‘[t]he Rules of Procedure are Parliament’s
              | Constitution. Matters affecting the Rules of Procedure are therefore always
              | political matters’ (14 March 1993). In addition, the timing of many changes
              | does not accord with changes in the external environment. The debates in
              | Parliament reveal that the two largest parties – the European People’s Party
              | (EPP) and the Party of the European Socialists (PES) – have frequently acted
              | in concert to shape the rules to their collective beneﬁt.
              | Interpreting rule change and rule evolution can be a difﬁcult and sub-
              | jective exercise because rule changes are open to multiple interpretations.
              | What type of evidence would be convincing corroboration of purposive and
              | intentional action on the part of the political groups in the EP to promote
              | cohesion? Is a rule that limits the speaking rights of individual members
              | simply an attempt to use a limited parliamentary schedule more efﬁciently,
              | or does it signal an attempt to reduce the rights of individual parliamen-
              | tarians? Most rule changes will appear technical and of minor consequence
              | even if intended for some more partisan purpose; it is in the interests of the
              | proposer to cloak them in neutral language. In addition, it is possible that
              | rules that may have profound partisan consequences down the line may not
              | McElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?
              | 4 4 3
              | actually have been originally intended for this purpose. One method of over-
              | coming the problems inherent in interpreting rules is to examine the debates
              | that surrounded their introduction. Were they perceived to be only technical
              | by the key actors involved? The debates of the European Parliament have not
              | been subject to signiﬁcant analyses and they are an unmined treasure trove
              | for those interested in the historical evolution of the institution.
              | The debates on the general revision of the Rules of Procedure in the ﬁrst
              | directly elected Parliament provide an illustrative example of the potential
              | for this alternative and complementary approach to the vexing question of
              | agenda powers. Much of the debate hinged on the rights of big groups versus
              | small groups, but it was also asserted that the proposed revisions aimed to
              | quell dissent within the large political groups themselves. Mario Capanna,
              | speaking on behalf of the Communists declared that,
              | This idiotic policy with regard to the Rules of Procedure has a very speciﬁc object
              | in view, namely to reduce the areas of dissent within Parliament. And I mean
              | dissent not only among the minority groups but also within the majority groups
              | whether of the right, centre-right or even, occasionally, the left.3
              | Else Hammerick, of the small left-wing Rainbow coalition (ARC), reiterated
              | this point when she complained about the new proposal to limit explanations
              | of the vote. She argued that not only would this proposal serve to strengthen
              | the large political groups vis-à-vis the small ones but it would also serve to
              | weaken dissenting party members within the large parties.
              | In future only one representative of each group would be allowed an explanation
              | of vote before voting took place. Only one from each group, that would sub-
              | stantially strengthen the position of the supranational political groups with their
              | pecking orders and hierarchies, and correspondingly weaken those who do not
              | share the group’s majority views and weaken national minorities within them. In
              | the past explanations of vote gave these minorities a chance to speak.4
              | The manner and means by which elected representatives attempt to get
              | their own preferences aired vary from legislature to legislature, but they
              | broadly fall into two categories: the right to table questions and the right to
              | place amendments on the parliamentary agenda. Major revisions of the rules
              | undertaken since 1979 have effectively removed many of these privileges
              | from individual members. For instance, the right to table amendments in
              | Parliament, the right to refer a report back to committee, the right to call for
              | an adjournment of debate and the right to call for a debate on a matter of
              | urgency have all been revoked from individual MEPs. Such rights now rest
              | with political groups or 40 members acting in concert. With the passage of
              | these revisions, individual members have been emasculated. Speaking time
              | 4 4 4
              | European Union Politics 8(3)
              | has also been drastically reduced over the years. In April 1979 there was
              | no limitation, for example, on the length of time a member could devote to
              | an ‘explanation of the vote’; by 2007 this right had been severely circum-
              | scribed such that a member ‘may give an oral explanation on the ﬁnal vote
              | for not longer than one minute’ (European Parliament, 2007: 163). Rule 142
              | further dictates that ‘No Member may speak for more than one minute on
              | any of the following: the minutes, procedural motions, amendments to the
              | ﬁnal draft agenda or to the agenda’. These policies not only stiﬂe indepen-
              | dent members but also serve to stiﬂe dissent within the larger groups.
              | The EP’s limits on individual rights are among the most restrictive in
              | Europe. Individual legislators do not possess signiﬁcant speaking rights or
              | adjournment rights in the EP, and what rights they did have, have been
              | severely circumscribed over the course of the past 25 years. Over the years,
              | political groups have become the gatekeepers of legislative amendments and
              | of most interruptive and procedural motions in the EP, and even a preliminary
              | analysis of the debates on this matter suggest that the two largest political
              | groups consciously undertook these rule changes. Before we dismiss the role
              | of agenda-setting powers in creating political group cohesion we should
              | examine rule evolution in this institution in greater detail.
              | A dynamic party system
              | Parties form, fail, merge and divide on a staggering basis in the EP. Simply
              | keeping track of which MEPs are in which political groups and which national
              | parties are afﬁliated with which of the supranational groups is no mean feat.
              | It is generally the case that in the literature on political parties far too little
              | attention is paid ‘to the evolution of party systems between elections’ (Laver
              | and Benoit, 2003). The authors of this book argue that there are ‘six main
              | political “families” which have remained relatively consistent across all six
              | elected parliaments’ (Hix et al., 2007: 23) and they identify these as social
              | democrat, centre-right, liberal, radical left, green and anti-European. This is
              | not a controversial claim, but the use of six party ‘families’ as the basic unit
              | of analysis in parts of the book may not capture the full extent of dynamism
              | that exists in the EP. This dynamism in party group formation is also of
              | interest to the very question of cohesion. Party families do not whip members
              | into line and this choice of analytical unit may depress the cohesion scores
              | for the smaller political groups, which appear at times to have been merged
              | by the authors into one family. As the authors openly acknowledge, the
              | radical left comprised several different political groups until well into the
              | third Parliament. Even excluding independents, there were 10 separate
              | McElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?
              | 4 4 5
              | political groups in the EP for most of the third legislative session, not six. The
              | number of political groups in the EP varies over time and only the three main
              | political groups can be thought of as party families in the traditional sense
              | for most of the history of the directly elected parliament.
              | As a general explanatory variable, party family has shortcomings when
              | it comes to explaining the dynamic nature of political groups in the EP.
              | Although capturing the broad spirit of the ideological basis on which party
              | groupings originally formed, the party family explanation inadequately
              | explains national party afﬁliation with EP party groups. First, party family is
              | an essentially static characterization, based on long-standing, ‘essential and
              | indelible’ (Klingemann et al., 1994: 24) issue associations and positions,
              | whereas national parties frequently and regularly switch EP party groups.
              | Second, many national parties do not belong to clearly deﬁnable party
              | families, either because their organizational basis does not correspond to the
              | classic cleavages or because they are formed primarily around new (single)
              | issues such as Europe or immigration. This situation characterizes many of
              | the parties from the eight post-communist member states.
              | A general problem with the concept of party family as an operational
              | variable is that, despite its wide use, the classiﬁcation of party family remains
              | underspeciﬁed. Even after years of research, there exists no golden index of
              | party family afﬁliations. This problem is exacerbated when one attempts to
              | extend the concept of party family beyond its West European base. For
              | instance, there are large numbers of parties in Eastern Europe that cannot
              | easily be classiﬁed in terms of party families because they do not share either
              | an ideological heritage or associational links with their West European
              | counterparts. Even advocates of the party family approach and experts in the
              | politics of Eastern Europe cannot place these political parties deﬁnitively into
              | party families. For instance, Taggart and Szczerbiak (2004) place many parties
              | such as the Czech Civic Democratic Party, the Slovak Christian Democratic
              | Movement and the Polish Union of Real Politics into both the Liberal and
              | Conservative party family in their study. There is much disagreement on what
              | even constitutes a party family. For example, do agrarian and centre parties
              | form one party family or two party families? Nonetheless, the association
              | between party family and policies towards European integration has been
              | used to conclude that political contestation in the European arena is largely
              | driven by cleavage patterns (Marks and Wilson, 2000; Marks et al., 2002).
              | The dynamics and evolution of the party system within the EP offer a
              | fruitful avenue of research for party scholars. In terms of party cohesion, this
              | dynamism offers interesting possibilities. Are national parties or MEPs who
              | fail to toe the political group line forced to leave the party, or do they volun-
              | tarily jump ship? Do legislators alter their voting behaviour as a consequence
              | 4 4 6
              | European Union Politics 8(3)
              | of changing party afﬁliation? If they fail to do so, we may have evidence of
              | partyless voting behaviour and perhaps have more conﬁdence in the use of
              | NOMINATE scores as ideological proxies. If, however, we witness change
              | this may be further evidence of party discipline. If legislators switch from a
              | more to a less disciplined party (or vice versa) and thus become subject to
              | shifting degrees of party instruction across roll calls, the matter becomes even
              | more complex (Rosenthal and Voeten, 2004). In future work one could address
              | these issues by dividing up the voting records of party-switchers and esti-
              | mating separate ideal points for the two parties they have afﬁliated with in
              | the course of a single legislative session.
              | Conclusion
              | These are exciting times for EP scholars. Better data and analytical tools have
              | become available in recent years that allow for much more systematic analysis
              | of legislative behaviour. In Democratic Politics in the European Parliament, Hix,
              | Noury and Roland ask many fundamental questions about the nature of
              | legislative organization in the European Parliament and provide many
              | answers. Perhaps even more importantly, this book challenges and motivates
              | a whole host of new puzzles, in the ﬁnest traditions of scientiﬁc research, and
              | deserves a very wide readership.
              | On a ﬁnal note, this book has fulﬁlled its mission to connect research on
              | the European Parliament to the general study of legislative behaviour and
              | institutions in political science. The true promise and potential of EU scholar-
              | ship is that it provides a testing ground for extant theories of legislative
              | behaviour, reinforcing what we already know and offering the possibility of
              | falsiﬁcation and, most importantly, the opportunity to broaden the trends in
              | legislative studies in general. It is remarkable that our understanding of
              | legislative politics is largely dictated by the experience of the US House of
              | Representatives. The similarities with the EP make for relatively easy
              | comparison, but it is perhaps the differences, such as the lack of an electoral
              | connection, that will be most instructive. How such differences inﬂuence
              | actors’ incentive structures and motivations and, as a consequence, their
              | behaviour and decision outcomes may fundamentally affect our very under-
              | standing of legislative politics.
