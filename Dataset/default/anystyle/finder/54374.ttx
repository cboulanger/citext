              | Recent studies documented that survey data contain duplicate records. In this paper, we assess
              | how duplicate records a ect regression estimates, and we evaluate the e ectiveness of solutions
              | to deal with them. Results show that duplicates bias the estimated coe cients and standard er-
              | rors. The chances of obtaining unbiased estimates when data contain 40 doublets (about 5% of
              | the sample) range between 3.5% and 11.5% depending on the distribution of duplicates. If 7
              | quintuplets are present in the data (2% of the sample), then the probability of obtaining biased
              | estimates ranges between 11% and 20%. Weighting the duplicate records by the inverse of
              | their multiplicity, or dropping superﬂuous duplicates outperform other solutions in all consid-
              | ered scenarios in reducing the bias and the risk of obtaining biased estimates. However, both
              | solutions overestimate standard errors, reducing the statistical power of estimates. Our study
              | illustrates the risk of using data in presence of duplicate records and call for further research
              | on strategies to analyse a ected data.

              | 1 Introduction
              | To achieve reliable results survey data must accurately
              | report respondents’ answers. Yet, sometimes they don’t.
              | The study of Slomczynski, Powałko, and Krauze (2017)
              | published in this issue of SRM investigated survey projects
              | widely used in social sciences, and reported a considerable
              | number of duplicate records in 17 out of 22 international
              | projects. Duplicate records are deﬁned as records that are
              | not unique, that is records in which the set of all (or nearly
              | all) answers from a given respondent is identical to that of
              | another respondent.
              | Surveys in social sciences usually include a large num-
              | ber of questions, and it is unlikely that two respondents pro-
              | vide identical answers to all (or nearly all) substantive survey
              | questions (Hill, 1999). In other words, it is unlikely that two
              | identical records originate from the answers of two real re-
              | spondents. It is more probable that one record corresponds to
              | a real respondent and the second one is its duplicate, or that

              | error or forgery by interviewers, data coders, or data pro-
              | cessing sta and should, therefore, be treated as suspicious
              | observations (American Statistical Association, 2004; Diek-
              | mann, 2005; Koczela, Furlong, McCarthy, & Mushtaq, 2015;
              | Kuriakose & Robbins, 2016; Waller, 2013).
              | 1.1
              | Duplicate records in social survey data
              | Slomczynski et al. (2017) analyzed 1,721 national surveys
              | belonging to 22 comparative survey projects, with data com-
              | ing from 142 countries and nearly 2.3 million respondents.
              | The analysis identiﬁed 5,893 duplicate records in 162 na-
              | tional surveys from 17 projects coming from 80 countries.
              | The duplicate records were unequally distributed across the
              | surveys. For example, they appeared in 19.6% of surveys of
              | the World Values Survey (waves 1–5) and in 3.4% of surveys
              | of the European Social Survey (waves 1–6). Across survey
              | projects, di erent numbers of countries were a ected. Lati-
              | nobarometro is an extreme case where surveys from 13 out
              | of 19 countries contained duplicate records. In the Americas
              | Barometer 10 out of 24 countries were a ected, and in the In-
              | ternational Social Survey Programme 19 out of 53 countries
              | contained duplicate records.

              | Even though the share of duplicate records in most sur-
              | veys did not exceed 1%, in some of the national surveys it
              | was high, exceeding 10% of the sample. In 52% of the af-
              | fected surveys Slomczynski et al. (2017) found only a sin-
              | gle pair of duplicate records. However, in 48% of surveys
              | containing duplicates they found various patterns of dupli-
              | cate records, such as multiple doublets (i.e. multiple pairs
              | of identical records) or identical records repeated three, four,
              | or more times. For instance, the authors identiﬁed 733 du-
              | plicate records (60% of the sample), including 272 doublets
              | and 63 triplets in the Ecuadorian sample of Latinobarometro
              | collected in the year 2000. Another example are data from
              | Norway registered by the International Social Survey Pro-
              | gramme in 2009, where 54 duplicate records consisted of
              | 27 doublets, 36 duplicate records consisted of 12 triplets,
              | 24 consisted of 6 quadruplets, 25 consisted of 5 quintuplets;
              | along with, one sextuplet, one septuplet, and one octuplet
              | (overall 160 duplicate records, i.e. 11.0% of the sample).
              | These ﬁgures refer to full duplicates. However, other re-
              | search analyzed the prevalence of near duplicates, that is
              | records which di er for only a small number of variables.
              | Kuriakose and Robbins (2016) analyzed near duplicates in
              | data sets commonly used in social sciences and showed that
              | 16% of analysed surveys reported a high risk of widespread
              | falsiﬁcation with near duplicates. The authors emphasized
              | that demographic and geographical variables are rarely falsi-
              | ﬁed, because they usually have to meet the sampling frame.
              | Behavioral and attitudinal variables, on the other hand, were
              | falsiﬁed more often. In such cases, interviewers may only
              | copy selected sequences of answers from other respondents,
              | so that the correlations between variables are as expected,
              | and the forgery remains undetected.
              | 1.2 Implications for estimation results
              | Duplicate records may a ect statistical inference in var-
              | ious ways. If duplicate records introduce “random noise”,
              | then they may produce an attenuation bias, i.e. bias the es-
              | timated coe cient towards zero (Finn & Ranchhod, 2013).
              | However, if the duplicate records do not introduce random
              | noise, they may bias the estimated correlations in other direc-
              | tions. The size of the bias should increase with the number
              | of duplicate interviews, and it should depend on the di er-
              | ence of covariances and averages between the original and
              | duplicate interviews (Schräpler & Wagner, 2005).
              | On the other hand, duplicate records can reduce the vari-
              | ance, and thus they may artiﬁcially increase the statistical
              | power of estimation techniques. The result is the opposite of
              | the attenuation bias: narrower estimated conﬁdence intervals
              | and stronger estimated relationships among variables (Kuri-
              | akose & Robbins, 2016). In turn, this may increase the statis-
              | tical signiﬁcance of the coe cients and a ect the substantive
              | conclusions.
              | The implications of duplicates for regression estimates
              | may di er according to the characteristics of the observa-
              | tions being duplicated. Slomczynski et al. (2017) suggested
              | that “typical” cases, i.e. the duplicate records located near
              | the median of a variable, may a ect estimates less than “de-
              | viant” cases, i.e. duplicate records located close to the ties of
              | the distribution.
              | The literature on how duplicate records a ect estimates
              | from regression analysis, and how to deal with them is virtu-
              | ally not existing. Past studies focused mainly on strategies to
              | identify duplicate and near-duplicate records (Elmagarmid,
              | Ipeirotis, & Verykios, 2007; Hassanzadeh & Miller, 2009;
              | Kuriakose & Robbins, 2016; Schreiner, Pennie, & New-
              | brough, 1988). However some studies analyzed how inten-
              | tionally falsiﬁed interviews (other than duplicates) a ected
              | summary statistics and estimation results. Schnell (1991)
              | studied the consequences of including purposefully falsiﬁed
              | interviews in the 1988 German General Social Survey (ALL-
              | BUS). The results showed a negligible impact on the mean
              | and standard deviation of variables. However, the falsiﬁed
              | responses produced stronger correlations between objective
              | and subjective measures, more consistent scales (with higher
              | Cronbach’s ), higher R2, and more signiﬁcant predictors
              | in OLS regression. More recently, Schräpler and Wagner
              | (2005) and Finn and Ranchhod (2013) did not conﬁrm the
              | greater consistency of falsiﬁed data. On the contrary, they
              | showed a negligible e ect of falsiﬁed interviews on estima-
              | tion bias and e ciency.
              | 1.3
              | Current analysis
              | Our study is the ﬁrst analysis of how duplicate records
              | a ect the bias and e ciency of regression estimates. We fo-
              | cus on two research questions: ﬁrst, how do duplicates a ect
              | regression estimates? Second, how e ective are the possible
              | solutions? We use a Monte Carlo simulation, a technique
              | for generating random samples on a computer to study the
              | consequences of probabilistic events (Ferrarini, 2011; Fish-
              | man, 2005). In our simulations we consider three scenarios
              | of duplicate data:
              | Scenario 1. when one record is multiplied several times (a
              | sextuplet, an octuplet, and a decuplet),
              | Scenario 2. when several records are duplicated once (16,
              | 40, and 79 doublets, which correspond to 2%, 5% and
              | 10% of the sample respectively),
              | Scenario 3. when several records are duplicated four times
              | (7, 16, and 31 quintuplets, which correspond to 2%,
              | 5% and 10% of the sample).
              | We chose the number of duplicates to mimic the results pro-
              | vided by Slomczynski et al. (2017). We also investigate how
              | regression estimates change when duplicates are located in
              | speciﬁc parts of the distribution of the dependent variable.
              | We evaluate four variants, namely:

text          | Variant i. when the duplicate records are chosen randomly
              | from the whole distribution of the dependent variable
              | (we label this variant “unconstrained” as we do not im-
              | pose any limitation on where the duplicate records are
              | located);
              | Variant ii. when they are chosen randomly between the ﬁrst
              | and third quartile of the dependent variable (i.e. when
              | they are located around the median: this is the “typi-
              | cal” variant);
              | Variant iii. when they are chosen randomly below the ﬁrst
              | quartile of the dependent variable (this is the ﬁrst “de-
              | viant” variant);
              | Variant iv. when they are chosen randomly above the third
              | quartile of the dependent variable (this is the second
              | “deviant” variant).
              | We expect, consistently with the suggestion by Slomczynski
              | et al. (2017), that Variants iii and iv a ect regression esti-
              | mates more than Variant i, and that Variant ii a ects them
              | the least. Additionally, we repeat the whole analysis to test
              | the robustness of our ﬁndings by checking how the position
              | on the distribution of one of the independent variables a ects
              | regression estimates.
              | For each scenario and variant we compute the follow-
              | ing measures to assess how duplicates a ect regression es-
              | timates:
              | Measure A. percentage bias of coe cients;
              | Measure B. bias of the standard errors;
              | Measure C. risk of obtaining biased estimates, as measured
              | by Dfbetas;
              | Measure D. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which in-
              | forms about the e ciency of the estimates.
              | We consider ﬁve solutions to deal with duplicate records,
              | and we assess their ability to reduce the bias and the e -
              | ciency loss:
              | Solution a. “naive” estimation, i.e. analysing the data as if
              | they were correct;
              | Solution b. dropping all the duplicates from the data;
              | Solution c. ﬂagging the duplicate records and including the
              | ﬂag among the predictors;
              | Solution d. dropping all superﬂuous duplicates;
              | Solution e. weighting the duplicate records by the inverse of
              | their multiplicity.
              | Finally, we check the sensitivity of our results to the sam-
              | ple size. Our basic analysis uses a sample of N = 1; 500,
              | because many nationally representative surveys provide sam-
              | ples of similar sizes. However, we also run the simulation for
              | samples of N = 500 and N = 5; 000 to check the robustness
              | of our results to the chosen sample sizes.

text          | Method
              | To assess how duplicate records a ect the results of OLS
              | regression we use a Monte Carlo simulation (Ferrarini, 2011;
              | Fishman, 2005). The reason is that we need an artiﬁcial data
              | set where the relationships among variables are known, and
              | in which we iteratively manipulate the number and distribu-
              | tion of duplicates. The random element in our simulation
              | is the choice of records to be duplicated, and the choice of
              | observations which are replaced by duplicates. At each iter-
              | ation, we compare the regression coe cients in presence of
              | duplicates with the true coe cients (derived from data with-
              | out duplicates) to tell whether duplicates a ect regression es-
              | timates.
              | Our analysis consists of four steps. First, we generate the
              | initial data set. Second, we duplicate randomly selected ob-
              | servations according to the three scenarios and four variants
              | mentioned above. In the third step we estimate regression
              | models using a “naive” approach, i.e. treating data with du-
              | plicates as if they were correct (Solution a). In the same step
              | we also estimate regression models using the four alternative
              | solutions (b–e) to deal with duplicate records. Finally, we
              | compute the bias of coe cients and standard errors, the risk
              | of obtaining biased estimates, and the Root Mean Square Er-
              | ror to assess the e ect of duplicates on regression estimates
              | and the e ectiveness of the solutions. Figure 1 summarizes
              | our strategy.
              | 2.1
              | Data generation
              | We begin by generating a data set of N = 1; 500 observa-
              | tions which contains three variables: x, z, and t. We create
              | the original data set using random normally distributed vari-
              | ables with a known correlation matrix (shown in Table 1).
              | The correlation matrix is meant to mimic real survey data
              | and it is based on the correlation of household income, age,
              | and number of hours worked as retrieved from the sixth wave
              | of the European Social Survey (2015).
              | We generate the dependent variable (y) as a linear function
              | of x, z, and t as reported in Equation 1:
              | yi = 5:36
              | 0:04 xi + 0:16 zi + 0:023 ti + i
              | (1)
              | where the coe cients are also retrieved from the sixth wave
              | of the European Social Survey. All variables and the error
              | term i are normally distributed. The descriptive statistics

              | Duplicating selected observations
              | In the second step we use a Monte Carlo simulation to
              | generate duplicate records, which replace for randomly cho-
              | sen original records, i.e. the interviews that would have been
              | conducted if no duplicates had been introduced in the data.
              | This strategy is motivated by the assumption that duplicate
              | records substitute for authentic interviews. Thus, if dupli-
              | cates are present, researchers do not only face the risk of

              | servations in three scenarios (each comprising three cases)
              | and in four variants. Thus, overall we investigate 36 patterns
              | (3 3 4 = 36) of duplicate records. For each pattern we run
              | 2,500 replications.
              | Scenario 1: a sextuplet, an octuplet, and a decuplet.
              | In the ﬁrst scenario we duplicate one randomly chosen record
              | 5, 7, and 9 times, thus introducing in the data a sextuplet,
              | an octuplet, and a decuplet of identical observations which
              | replace for 5, 7, and 9 randomly chosen original observa-
              | tions. These cases are possible in the light of the analysis by

              | instances of octuplets. In this scenario the share of duplicates
              | in the sample is small, ranging from 0,4% for a sextuplet to
              | 0,7% for a decuplet.
              | Scenario 2: 16, 40, and 79 doublets. In the second sce-
              | nario we duplicate sets of 16, 40, and 79 randomly chosen
              | observations one time, creating 16, 40, and 79 pairs of iden-
              | tical observations (doublets). In this scenario the share of
              | duplicates is 2,1% (16 doublets), 5,3% (40 doublets), and
              | 10,5% (79 doublets). These shares are consistent with the
              | results by Slomczynski et al. (2017), as in their analysis
              | about 15% of the a ected surveys had 10% or more duplicate
              | records.
              | Scenario 3: 7, 16, and 31 quintuplets. In the third sce-
              | nario we duplicate sets of 7, 16 and 31 randomly chosen ob-
              | servations 4 times, creating 7, 16 and 31 quintuplets. They
              | replace, for 28, 64, and 124 randomly chosen original records
              | respectively. In this scenario the share of duplicate records is
              | 2,3% (7 quintuplets), 5,3% (16 quintuplets), and 10,3% (31
              | quintuplets).
              | To check whether the position of duplicates in the distri-
              | bution matters, we run each of the scenarios in four variants,
              | as presented in Figure 2.
              | Variant i (“unconstrained”). The duplicates and the
              | replaced interviews are randomly drawn from the overall dis-
              | tribution of the dependent variable.
              | Variant ii (“typical”). The duplicates are randomly
              | drawn from the values around the median of the dependent
              | variable, i.e. between the ﬁrst and third quartile, and the re-
              | placed interviews are drawn from the overall distribution.
              | Variant iii and iv (“deviant”). In Variant iii the dupli-
              | cates are randomly drawn from the lower quartile of the de-
              | pendent variable; in Variant iv they are randomly drawn from
              | the upper quartile of the dependent variable. The replaced
              | interviews are drawn from the overall distribution.
              | To illustrate our data, Table A1 in Appendix A reports the
              | descriptive statistics of some of the data sets produced during
              | the replications (lines 5 to 45).
              | 2.3
              | “Naive” estimation and alternative solutions
              | In the third step we run a “naive” estimation which takes
              | data as they are, and subsequently we investigate the four so-
              | lutions to deal with duplicates. For each solution we estimate
              | the following model:
              | yi =
              | + x xi + z zi + t ti + "i
              | (2)
              | Solution a: “naive” estimation. First, we investigate
              | what happens when researchers neglect the presence of du-
              | plicate observations. In other words, we analyze data with
              | duplicate records as if they were correct. This allows us to
              | estimate the percentage bias, the standard errors, the risk of
              | obtaining biased estimates, and the Root Mean Square Error
              | resulting from the mere presence of duplicate records (see

              | Solution b: Drop all duplicates. In Solution b we drop
              | all duplicates, including the observations that may come
              | from true interviews. We consider such a case, because, if
              | records are identical on some, but not on all variables (most
              | likely, di erences may exist on demographic and geograph-
              | ical variables to reﬂect the sampling scheme), then it is not
              | obvious to tell the original observations from the fake dupli-
              | cates. It is also possible that all duplicates are forged and
              | should be excluded from the data. Therefore, rather that
              | deleting the superﬂuous duplicates and retaining the original
              | records, we exclude all duplicate records from the data at the
              | cost of reducing the sample size.
              | Solution c: Flag duplicated observations and control
              | for them. This solution is similar to the previous one be-
              | cause we identify all duplicate records as suspicious. How-
              | ever, rather than dropping them, we generate a dichotomous
              | variable (duplicate = 1, otherwise = 0), and include it among
              | the predictors in Equation 2. Slomczynski et al. (2017) pro-
              | posed this solution as a way to control for the error generated
              | by duplicate records.
              | Solution d: Drop superﬂuous duplicates.
              | “[E]liminating duplicate and near duplicate observations
              | from analysis is imperative to ensuring valid inferences”
              | (Kuriakose & Robbins, 2016, p. 2). Hence, we delete
              | superﬂuous duplicates to retain a sample of unique records.
              | The di erence compared to Solution b is that we keep one
              | record for each set of duplicates.
              | Solution e: Weight by the inverse of multiplicities.
              | Lessler and Kalsbeek (1992) proposed this method. We
              | construct a weight which takes the value of 1 for unique
              | records, and the value of the inverse of multiplicity for du-
              | plicate records. For example, the weight takes the value 0.5
              | for doublets, 0.2 for quintuplets, 0.1 for decuplets, etc. Sub-
              | sequently, we use these weights to estimate Equation 2.
              | 2.4
              | The assessment of bias and e ciency
              | We use four measures to assess the consequences of du-
              | plicates for regression estimates, and to investigate the e -
              | ciency of the solutions to deal with them.
              | Measure A: Bias of coe cients. This macro measure
              | of bias informs whether a coe cient is systematically over
              | or under estimated. It is computed as follows:
              | Bias of coe cients = BBBBB0 bi

              | coe cients (bi).
              | Measure B: Bias of standard errors. To test whether
              | duplicates artiﬁcially increase the power of regression es-
              | timates, we compute the average of the standard errors
              | (SE(bi)) for each scenario, variant, and solution. For ease
              | of interpretation, we express our measure as a percentage of
              | the standard errors estimated in the true model (see Equation
              | 4).

              | o set each other. To assess the risk of obtaining biased es-
              | timates in a speciﬁc replication, we resort to Dfbetas, which
              | are normalized measures of how much speciﬁc observations
              | (in our case the duplicates) a ect the estimates of regression
              | coe cients. Dfbetas are deﬁned as the di erence between
              | the estimated and the true coe cients, expressed in relation
              | to the standard error of the estimated coe cient (see Equa-
              | tion 5).

              | to Equation 6. We set the cuto value to 0.5, i.e. we consider

              | Percentage bias
              | Table 2 shows the percentage bias of the coe cient x for
              | the considered scenarios, variants, and solutions. The results
              | for the other coe cients are reported in Tables B1–B3 in Ap-
              | pendix B. The third column of Table 2 contains information
              | about the percentage bias for solution a, i.e. the “naive” esti-
              | mation.
              | Overall, the percentage bias takes values between nearly
              | zero (in Scenario 1 and in all Scenarios in Variant i) and about
              | 7%. For x it reaches the maximum values of 4% for 79 dou-
              | blets and 6% for 31 quintuplets. The maximum bias for z
              | and t is 5%–7%, and for the intercept it is 2.5%–4% (see
              | Appendix B).
              | The results show some regularities. First, number and
              | composition of duplicates matter. The bias systematically
              | increases with the share of duplicates in the data, and dupli-
              | cates consisting of quintuplets produce greater bias than du-
              | plicates consisting of doublets. Second, the choice of records
              | to be duplicated plays a role. The “unconstrained” variant
              | (Variant i), where duplicate cases are randomly selected, pro-
              | duces virtually no bias, even when the share of duplicates
              | reaches 10% of the sample. On the other hand, Variant ii pro-
              | duces similar bias as Variants iii and iv. In other words, con-
              | trary to our expectations, the duplication of “typical” records
              | produces a bias similar to the one induced by the presence
              | of “deviant” duplicates. Only randomly chosen duplicates
              | generate no bias. Third, although previous studies suggested
              | that duplicates may introduce “random noise” to the data,
              | thus leading to attenuation bias, we did not ﬁnd the evidence
              | to support this expectation: depending on the Variant (ii–iv),
              | for each variable the presence of duplicates induces a mix of
              | overestimated and underestimated coe cients.
              | Among the four solutions to deal with duplicates, solu-
              | tions d and e, i.e. dropping the superﬂuous duplicates and
              | weighting by the inverse of multiplicity perform the best in
              | all Variants, reducing the bias to zero. On the other hand,
              | dropping all duplicates (solution b) and ﬂagging duplicates
              | and controlling for them in the regression (solution c) per-
              | form poorly. Especially in Scenario 2 both these solutions
              | increase the bias of all coe cients; in Scenario 3 they reduce
              | the bias, but to a lesser degree than solutions d and e.
              | In sum, duplicates can systematically bias regression es-
              | timates if they are not randomly created. However, the bias
              | in our simulation did not exceed 10% of the true coe cients.
              | Moreover, dropping superﬂuous duplicates or weighting by
              | the inverse of their multiplicity are e ective ways to reduce
              | the bias to zero.
              | 3.2
              | Standard errors
              | To understand whether duplicates artiﬁcially increase the
              | statistical power of regression estimates, we inspect the av-
              | erage estimated standard errors, as shown in Table 3 for x.
              | The results for other coe cients are presented in Tables C1–
              | C3 in Appendix C.
              | The results show, similarly to the case of percentage bias,
              | that duplicates in Variant i, i.e. randomly drawn from the
              | overall distribution (“unconstrained”), do not a ect the es-
              | timates of the standard errors. In Variant ii, in which the
              | duplicates are located around the median of the dependent
              | variable, the estimated standard errors are biased downwards
              | by maximum 2%–3%, thus the conﬁdence intervals are nar-
              | rower than in the true model. On the contrary, in Variants
              | iii and iv, i.e. the two “deviant” cases, duplicates lead to
              | standard errors biased upwards by maximum 2%–3%, and to
              | broader conﬁdence intervals. Both e ects are stronger when
              | data contain more duplicates, i.e. when data contain 79 dou-
              | blets or 31 quintuplets.
              | Among the considered solutions, ﬂagging and controlling
              | for duplicates (Solution c) leads to systematically narrower
              | conﬁdence intervals. This is especially worrisome because
              | the same solution produces the most biased coe cients. In
              | other words, this solution may result in biased and signiﬁcant
              | coe cients, thus a ecting the interpretation of the results.
              | The remaining three Solutions, b, d, and e, produce slightly
              | greater standard errors than the naive estimation. The rela-
              | tive performance of the solutions varies across speciﬁc coef-
              | ﬁcients: for x and z Solution e works better than dropping
              | duplicates, but it overestimates the standard errors more than
              | dropping the duplicates for t and the intercept.
              | Summing up, we ﬁnd no evidence that the duplicates ar-
              | tiﬁcially increase the statistical power of the estimates if the
              | duplicates are created randomly. However, if duplicates are
              | chosen from the center of the distribution they may lead to
              | narrower conﬁdence intervals, thus artiﬁcially increasing the
              | statistical power. On the other hand, duplication of “deviant”
              | cases reduces the power of estimates. In both cases the e ect
              | is small, up to 3% of the true standard errors. Yet, the most
              | e ective solutions to reduce the bias of coe cients, i.e. drop-
              | ping the superﬂuous duplicates and weighting by the inverse
              | of multiplicity, increase the estimated standard errors, thus
              | reducing the power of estimates.
              | 3.3
              | Risk of obtaining biased estimates
              | While percentage bias informs about the average bias due
              | to duplicates, it is plausible that estimates in speciﬁc repli-
              | cations have upward and downward biases which, on aver-
              | age, o set each other. In other words, even with moderate
              | bias, researchers can obtain biased estimates in speciﬁc es-
              | timations. To address this issue we turn to the analysis of
              | Dfbetas.
              | Figure 3 shows box and whiskers diagrams of Dfbetas in
              | Scenarios 2 (upper panel) and 3 (lower panel) for Variant i,
              | i.e. when the duplicates are randomly drawn from the over-
              | all distribution of the dependent variable. We do not report

              | results for Scenario 1 because in this case the risk of obtain-
              | ing biased estimates is virtually zero. Results, however, are
              | detailed in Table 4. On the y-axis we report the Dfbetas, on
              | the x-axis we report the coe cients and the solutions. The
              | two horizontal solid lines identify the cuto values of Dfbe-
              | tas (0.5) separating the replications with acceptable bias from
              | the unacceptable ones. The diagrams show that the range of
              | Dfbetas increases with the share of duplicates in the data,
              | and it is larger for quintuplets (Scenario 3) than for doublets
              | (Scenario 2).
              | The average probability of obtaining unbiased estimates
              | for all coe cients is shown in Table 4. Column a shows that,
              | in case of “naive” estimations, the risk of biased estimates
              | varies from 0,14% (Scenario 1, one sextuplet, Variant ii) to
              | about 58% (Scenario 3, 31 quintuplets, Variants iii and iv).
              | In Scenario 1 the risk is small, with 89%–99% probability of
              | obtaining unbiased estimates.
              | The results show three regularities. First, the risk of ob-
              | taining biased estimates increases with the share of dupli-
              | cates: it is 0.2%–0.7% (depending on the variant) for 16
              | doublets, but it grows to 14.0%–32.5% when 79 doublets
              | are included in the data. In Scenario 3 it grows from 3.0%–
              | 20.2% for 7 quintuplets, to 43.0%–58.6% when data contain
              | 31 quintuplets.
              | Second, when the duplicates constitute the same share of
              | the data, the risk of obtaining biased estimates is higher for
              | quintuplets than for doublets. For example, when duplicates
              | constitute 2% of the sample, the risk of obtaining biased es-
              | timates is below 1% if they are 16 doublets, but ranges be-
              | tween 3% and 20% (depending on the variant) for 7 quintu-
              | plets. When duplicates constitute 10% of the data, the risk
              | of obtaining biased estimates is 14%–32% in case of 79 dou-
              | blets, but 43%–58% for 31 quintuplets.
              | Third, the risk of obtaining biased estimates is the highest
              | in Variants iii and iv, i.e. when the duplicates are located
              | on the ties, and lowest in Variant ii, when the duplicates are
              | located around the median. For example, with 7 quintuplets,
              | the probability of obtaining biased estimates is about 3% in
              | Variant ii, but rises to about 20% in Variants iii and iv. For 31
              | quintuplets the risk is about 43% in Variant ii, but over 58%
              | in Variants iii and iv.
              | As in case of percentage bias, weighting by the inverse
              | of the multiplicity (Solution e), and dropping the superﬂuous
              | duplicates (Solution d) perform better than other solutions
              | (see Table 4 and Figure 3). In Scenario 2, when doublets con-
              | stitute about 5% of the data, these two solutions reduce the
              | probability of obtaining biased estimates from about 4% (in
              | Variants i and ii) or about 11% (Variants iii and iv) to under
              | 1% in all cases. In case of 79 doublets, i.e when duplicates
              | constitute about 10% of the sample, the risk of obtaining bi-
              | ased estimates reduces to about 3%, independently from the
              | location of the duplicates, whereas it ranges between 14%
              | and 33% for the naive estimation. In Scenario 3, when quin-
              | tuplets constitute about 5% of the data, the risk of obtaining
              | biased estimates declines from 19%–43% (depending on the
              | variant) to about 2%. When quintuplets constitute about 10%
              | of the sample, solutions d and e decrease the risk of obtaining
              | biased estimates from 43%–59% to about 9%.
              | To sum up, weighting by the inverse of multiplicity and
              | dropping the superﬂuous duplicates are the most e ective so-
              | lutions among the examined ones. Moreover, they perform
              | particularly well when the duplicates are located on the ties
              | of the distribution, i.e. when the risk of bias is the highest.
              | On the other hand, Solutions b (excluding all duplicates)
              | and c (ﬂagging the duplicates) perform worse. Flagging du-
              | plicates and controlling for them (c) fails to reduce the risk
              | of obtaining biased estimates in both Scenarios 2 and 3. Ex-
              | cluding all duplicates (b) reduces the risk of obtaining biased
              | estimates in Scenario 3 (quintuplets), but it performs poorly
              | in Scenario 2: if the doublets are located on the ties, then
              | dropping all duplicate records decreases the probability of
              | obtaining unbiased estimates.
              | 3.4
              | Root Mean Square Error
              | Table 5 shows the values of normalized RMSE for coe -
              | cient x. Results for other coe cients are available in Tables
              | D1–D3 in Appendix D. Scores are overall small, reaching
              | about 9% of the x coe cient, 15% of z, 24% of t, and 6%
              | of the intercept.
              | The RMSE captures both the bias and the standard errors,
              | thus it is not surprising that the results are consistent with
              | those presented in the sections above. First, RMSE increases
              | with the number of duplicates, and it is the highest for 79
              | doublets and 31 quintuplets. Second, the presence of ran-
              | domly duplicated observations (Variant i) has little e ect on
              | the e ciency of the estimates, whereas the presence of “typ-
              | ical” (Variant ii) and “deviant” (Variant iii and iv) duplicates
              | reduces the e ciency of estimates.
              | Consistently with previous results, Solutions d and e, i.e.
              | dropping superﬂuous duplicates and weighting the data per-
              | form the best, reasonably reducing the RMSE values. In con-
              | trast to that, ﬂagging the duplicates and controlling for them
              | (Solution c) performs poorly, and in some cases (especially
              | in Scenario 2, but for x also in Scenario 3) it further reduces
              | the e ciency of the estimates.

              | arbitrarily chose a sample size of N = 1; 500 observations
              | to mimic the average size of many of the publicly available

              | from our choice, we repeated the experiment using two al-
              | ternative samples: N = 500 and N = 5; 000. In Figure 4
              | we report the results (DFbetas) for Scenario 2, Variant i. The

text          | Figure 4 shows that the dispersion of the estimates with
              | respect to the true values increases when the number of dupli-
              | cates increases. Neglecting the presence of duplicates creates
              | some problems when the share of duplicates reaches about
              | 5% of the sample.
              | For N = 500 the probabilities of obtaining biased esti-
              | mates amount to 2% and 11.4% when the doublets constitute
              | 5% and 10% of the sample respectively. For N = 5; 000 the
              | same probabilities are 3% and 13%. These values are fairly
              | in line with the results obtained for N = 1; 500 for Variant i
              | (3.5% and 14%).
              | Consistently with the results for N = 1; 500, weighting
              | by the inverse of the multiplicity or dropping all superﬂuous
              | duplicates are most e ective in reducing the risk of obtaining
              | biased estimates. Our conclusion about the inﬂuence of du-

text          | Conclusions
              | Reliable data are a prerequisite for well grounded analy-
              | ses. In this paper we focused on the consequences of du-
              | plicate records for regression estimates. A review of the
              | literature shows that there are no papers dealing with this
              | topic. Yet, two recent independent studies by Slomczynski
              | et al. (2017) and by Kuriakose and Robbins (2016) raised the
              | awareness about the quality of survey data and they warned
              | about the possible consequences of ignoring the presence of
              | duplicate records. The two teams of researchers showed that
              | a number of widely used surveys is a ected by duplicate
              | records to varying degrees. Unfortunately, little is known
              | about the bias and e ciency loss induced by duplicates in
              | survey data. Present paper partly ﬁlls this gap by address-
              | ing two research questions: ﬁrst, how do duplicates a ect
              | regression estimates? Second, how e ective are the possible
              | solutions to deal with duplicates?
              | To this aim we created an artiﬁcial data set of N = 1; 500
              | observations and four variables with a known covariance ma-
              | trix. We adopted a Monte Carlo simulation with 2; 500 repli-
              | cations to investigate the consequences of 36 patterns (3 sce-
              | narios 3 cases in each scenario 4 variants) of duplicate
              | records. The scenarios included: (1) multiple duplications of
              | a single record: sextuplet, octuplet and decuplet; (2) multi-
              | ple doublets (16, 40, 79, corresponding to 2%, 5%, and 10%
              | of the sample); and (3) multiple quintuplets (7, 16, 31, cor-
              | responding to 2%, 5%, and 10% of the sample). The four
              | variants allowed us to investigate whether the reliability of
              | regression estimates changed when the duplicates were situ-
              | ated in speciﬁc parts of the data distribution: (i) on the whole
              | distribution, (ii) around the median, (iii) on the lower tie, and
              | (iv) on the upper tie of the distribution of the dependent vari-
              | able.
              | For each of the scenarios we run a “naive” estimation,
              | which ignored the presence of duplicate records. This al-
              | lowed us to investigate the consequences of duplicate records
              | for regression estimates. Speciﬁcally, we investigated the
              | percentage bias, the standard errors, the risk of obtaining bi-
              | ased estimates, and the root mean square error (RMSE) to
              | understand under which conditions, and to which extent the
              | presence of duplicates is problematic.
              | The results showed that duplicates may bias regression es-
              | timates when duplicate records are located in speciﬁc parts
              | of the distribution. In other words, the bias was null when
              | the duplicates were randomly drawn from the overall distri-
              | bution of the dependent variable (Variant i). Interestingly,
              | duplicating “typical” cases (Variant ii) was just as problem-
              | atic as duplicating “deviant” cases (Variants iii and iv). In
              | our simulation the bias was rather low: it reached the highest
              | value of about 7% when the data contained 31 quintuplets.
              | Overall, the bias increased with the share of duplicates in the
              | data, and it was higher for quintuplets than for doublets.
              | The presence of duplicates in the data a ected also the
              | standard errors, and therefore the conﬁdence intervals. Sim-
              | ilarly as in the case of the percentage bias, duplicates ran-
              | domly chosen from the overall distribution (Variant i) did not
              | a ect standard errors. Duplicating “typical” cases (Variant
              | ii) biased the standard errors downwards, thus increasing the
              | statistical power of the estimates. On the contrary, the pres-
              | ence of “deviant” cases (Variants iii and iv) biased the stan-
              | dard errors upwards, thus producing less precise estimates.
              | The bias of standard errors was overall low (up to maximum
              | 3%), and it was higher when more duplicates were present in
              | the data.
              | The presence of duplicates also a ected the risk of ob-
              | taining biased estimates. We considered as biased the co-
              | e cients that departed by at least 0.5 standard errors from
              | the true value. The risk of obtaining biased estimates in-
              | creased with the share of duplicates in the data, reaching the
              | values between 44%–59% (depending on the Variant) when
              | 31 quintuplets were present in the data. The risk was also
              | higher when the duplicates were located on the ties of the
              | distribution (Variants iii and iv), and it was the lowest when
              | the duplicates were located in the center of the distribution
              | (Variant ii). Also the pattern of duplicates mattered, with
              | quintuplets being more problematic than doublets.
              | The above results are interesting in the light of previous
              | studies which discussed the possible consequences of dupli-
              | cates for regression estimates. We found no evidence of at-
              | tenuation bias, which suggests that duplicates do not intro-
              | duce random noise in the data. Moreover, we did not ﬁnd any

              | bias when duplicates were located randomly on the overall
              | distribution. On the other hand, if the duplicates were lo-
              | cated in a speciﬁc part of the distribution, the bias was sys-
              | tematic. Moreover, we found that duplicates increased the
              | statistical power of estimates if the duplicated cases were lo-
              | cated in the center of the distribution. On the contrary, when
              | duplicates were located on the ties of the distribution, they
              | biased the conﬁdence intervals upwards. We also found that
              | duplication of “typical” cases is as problematic as duplica-
              | tion of “deviant” cases. It may be even considered more
              | problematic because the bias produced by “typical” dupli-
              | cates is accompanied by narrower conﬁdence intervals, i.e.
              | higher statistical signiﬁcance. On the other hand, biased co-
              | e cients produced by “deviant” duplicates are accompanied
              | by broader conﬁdence intervals.
              | The number and patterns of duplicate records used in this
              | analysis are consistent with those identiﬁed by Slomczynski
              | et al. (2017), and they can, therefore, be regarded as realistic.
              | Hence, our ﬁrst conclusion is that although the bias and e -
              | ciency loss related to duplicate records are small, duplicates
              | create a risk of obtaining biased estimates. Thus, researchers
              | who use data with duplicate records risk to reach misleading
              | conclusions.
              | The second goal of our analysis was to investigate the ef-
              | ﬁcacy of four solutions to reduce the e ect of duplicates on
              | estimation results. They included: (b) dropping all duplicates
              | from the sample; (c) ﬂagging duplicates and controlling for
              | them in the estimation; (d) dropping all superﬂuous dupli-
              | cates; (e) weighting the observations by the inverse of the
              | duplicates’ multiplicity.
              | The techniques that performed the best are solutions d and
              | e, which basically reduced the bias of the coe cient to zero.
              | They also performed well in reducing the risk of obtaining
              | biased estimates. The downside is that these solutions bi-
              | ased upwards the estimated standard errors. Hence, although
              | dropping the superﬂuous duplicates or weighting the obser-
              | vations by the inverse of the duplicates’ multiplicity allow to
              | obtain unbiased coe cients, these solutions come at the cost
              | of decreasing the statistical power of estimates.
              | The solution which performed the worst was ﬂagging du-
              | plicates and controlling for them in the estimation. It pro-
              | duced coe cients’ estimates that were more biased than
              | those obtained in the naive estimation. Additionally, it sys-
              | tematically underestimated the standard errors. This is a par-
              | ticularly worrisome combination because biased coe cients
              | were associated to a higher statistical conﬁdence.
              | Hence, the second conclusion from our study is that
              | weighting the duplicates by the inverse of their multiplic-
              | ity or dropping the superﬂuous duplicates are the best so-
              | lutions among the considered ones. These solutions outper-
              | form all the others in reducing the percentage bias, in reduc-
              | ing the risk of obtaining biased estimates, and minimizing the
              | RMSE. Unfortunately, they are associated to larger standard
              | errors, and therefore to lower statistical power. Flagging du-
              | plicates and controlling for them is consistently a worst solu-
              | tion, and in some cases (especially for Scenario 2) it produces
              | a higher bias, narrower conﬁdence intervals, higher risk of
              | obtaining biased estimates, and greater e ciency loss than
              | the “naive” estimation.
              | Our results do not depend on the sample size we chose
              | (N = 1; 500): they do not change whether we use a smaller
              | (N = 500) or a larger (N = 5; 000) sample. Similarly, the
              | results do not change if the variants are deﬁned on the basis
              | of one of the independent variables in the regression rather
              | than the dependent one.
              | These are the ﬁrst results documenting the e ect of dupli-
              | cates for survey research, and they pave the road for further
              | research on the topic. For instance, our study considered an
              | ideal case in which the model used by researchers perfectly
              | ﬁtted the relationship in the data, i.e. all relevant predic-
              | tors were included in the model. This is an unusual situa-
              | tion in social research. Second, our study did not account
              | for heterogeneity of populations. We analyze a case when
              | the relationships of interest are the same for all respondents.
              | In other words, we considered a situation without unmod-
              | eled interactions among variables. Third, in our model the
              | records which were substituted by duplicates (the interviews
              | which would have been conducted if no duplicates were in-
              | troduced in the data) were selected randomly. In reality this
              | is probably not the case, as these are likely the respondents
              | who are the most di cult to reach by interviewers. Plausi-
              | bly, the omitted variables, the heterogeneity of the popula-
              | tion, and the non-random choice of the interviews replaced
              | by the duplicates exacerbate the impact of duplicates on re-
              | gression coe cients. This suggests that our estimates of the
              | e ect of duplicates on percentage bias, standard errors, risk
              | of obtaining biased estimates, and e ciency loss are in many
              | aspects conservative. Moreover, our study assumed that non-
              | unique records were duplicates of true interviews and not
              | purposefully generated fakes. Addressing these limitations
              | is a promising path for future research.
              | Overall, our results emphasize the importance of collect-
              | ing data of high quality, because correcting the data with
              | statistical tools is not a trivial task. This calls for further
              | research about how to address the presence of duplicates in
              | the data and for more reﬁned statistical tools to minimize the
              | consequent bias of coe cients and standard errors, the risk
              | of obtaining biased estimates, and the e ciency loss.
