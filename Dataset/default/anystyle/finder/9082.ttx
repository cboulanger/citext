              | Key words:
              | performative social
              | science, art-
              | world/socialworld,

              | research
              | Abstract: The following paper is about artists doing experimental and performative art who expect
              | the spectators to become participants in the process of artwork production. The artwork is thus pro-
              | duced through a process of participation. As a researcher, I was similarly expected to participate in
              | the artwork process. As I observed, the artists worked at having their agency in the artwork process
              | recognized by the participating spectators. At the same time, the artists create a certain proximity to
              | the spectators-participants through performing art, which I call "performing proximity." By involving
              | the participants in their art-in-process, they make use of their agency to redefine the artworld and
              | enlarge it into other social worlds. I also discuss how artists' ability to enact redefined social worlds
              | can be compared to agency in performative social science and in biographical research.

              | 1. "Learning to Fly" Interlude
              | Everett HUGHES developed a strategy for his students to learn to "fly on their
              | own" in their field of research1 (PUNCH, 1998). This refers to an artwork by
              | Serbian artist Tomislav VUKIC, who found a ventilator without blades in the
              | street. He turned it into an object of art and called his work "learning to fly," a title
              | inspired by the song "Learning to Fly"2 by Pink Floyd. Learning to fly can be read
              | as both a reflection of the stagnant political situation in Serbia, which was as
              | enigmatic to him as his own existence as an artist, and his artistic development;
              | that is, his ability to be an artist without "crashing". Only the title "Learning to fly"
              | is underscored and, as it were, abbreviated by the work itself, which presents a
              | ventilator without blades or "wings."

              | Reason", EMI records.

              | 2. Performing Proximity
              | My research uses radio as an experimental space and employs participant
              | observation and interaction to reconstruct, through interactions with artists, the
              | production of symbolic forms in the framework of a concept of a deliberative
              | public sphere. In interview settings with artists, I accept how they communicate
              | their own reality and how they narrate auto-biographical material. It is meaningful
              | how they invent their realities and how these take on their own meanings.
              | Increasingly, artists themselves are anticipating sociologists in finding ways into
              | social worlds and preparing social worlds for the sociologists. In my view, these
              | procedures of doing art-in-process present new challenges to the methods
              | employed in order to understand artistic practices. Based on preliminary
              | considerations of the performative and participatory aspects of aesthetic
              | experience, this article discusses the interrelationship between artistic production
              | and performative social science. I present two examples "Lawrence" and "Micky,"
              | and discuss how aspects of biographical work can be connected with processual
              | structures of performative artistic practices. Proximity in the working alliance with
              | artists gives the chance to reflect performative aspects in these practices of doing
              | art and shows that reflections of approximation in performances are as important
              | as the articulation of the artist's autonomous position. I see these approaches in
              | performative research with artists as comparable with techniques within
              | performative social science. [2]
              | Within the framework of the generative contexts of artistic works, the artist
              | undertakes the performative assertion and determination of a work in its fragility,
              | because art works are performative themselves. Artists justify their work while
              | they conceptualize it or if they install a work in a public space, they deliberate and
              | explain their concept and this is part of the process of doing art. These
              | justifications are more powerful today, as we have entered a process of
              | permanent democratization and deliberation. Furthermore, these justifications
              | © 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/
              | FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"
              | must be understood aesthetically as being as important as the role of the
              | observer. The fragility of language in the constitution of art works ought to be
              | acknowledged,3 as ADORNO (1997) framed the ethical and humanizing attitude
              | he demanded from modernism's discourse on art, so to should the artistic agent's
              | role also be acknowledged. For example, what artists actually do through their
              | arts practice plays a role in academic and critical discourses, because those
              | artists are the agents in the process of creating artworks. [3]
              | What, then, do artists produce, and how is this related to performative social
              | science? How is this question related to the manner in which sociological and
              | aesthetic theory registers changes and transformations in order to redefine the
              | interrelation between art and science? In the next section I will elaborate the role
              | of performativity in both art and science. [4]
              | 3. Performativity in Art and Science
              | Art and science have been seen as two different domains, apparently facing each
              | other in an opposition that has become obsolete. Similarly, conventional dualisms
              | such as private vs. public no longer apply to the dynamic acts of artists when the
              | latter present installation work and actions in exhibition spaces that invert life-
              | worlds. Artists react to changed aesthetic experiences and reflect environments
              | and landscapes of knowledge in their work. In MERSCH's view, art proves a "way
              | of thinking and research of its own, one that we must regard as an equal in its
              | own right of the natural sciences and of exact mathematics" (MERSCH, 2007,
              | p.97; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). Art is a matter of technique. In today's
              | rapidly changing world, with its new technologies and new forms of
              | communication, artists develop new domains of experience by creating, within
              | their own system of reference, artistic forms of expression that have changed this
              | system of reference, the "artworld4." And yet we understand these forms of
              | expression because, as viewers, we are engaged in this form of participation in
              | these artistic processes. [5]
              | When the philosopher AUSTIN described the distinction between "performative"
              | and "constative speech acts" in "How to do things with words" (1962), he
              | considered "whether he could find any grammatical criterion for distinguishing the
              | performative utterances" (ANDERSSON, 1975, p.5). ANDERSSON concluded
              | "that he could not find any single simple criterion of grammar or vocabulary by
              | which he could distinguish the performatives from other utterances [...] or that
              | marks out the 'performative use' of them" (ibid. p.5). HANTELMANN states that
              | "the same holds true for artwork. To speak of a performative artwork is tauto-
              | logical, because there can be no non-performative artwork" (2007a, p.415). [6]
              | The performative dimension of art does not address "the signifying character of
              | the work of art [...] its factual existence here comes to the fore as significant, as
              | the point of departure for a potential of artistic action and assertion"
              | 3 See BUTLER (1997).

              | cooperative work with artists in "Artworlds."

              | (HANTELMANN, 2007a, p.415). The social aspect of ambitious art,
              | HANTELMANN contends, is manifest in art with a performative orientation that
              | has turned toward social critique. Consequently, artistic positions such as those
              | assumed by COLEMAN, BUREN, SEHGAL, and KOON abdicate the critical
              | distance from society in favor of "a consciousness of participation (in society)"
              | (HANTELMANN, 2007b, p.9; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). These artists
              | "recognize a power over artistic action not outside of, but within the museum
              | frame of art" (ibid., 2007b, p.9; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). They do not
              | attempt to strive toward a break with the conventions of art, recognizing,
              | "in those conventions, which govern the social interaction with art, an active power of
              | art directed at the social. [...] The work of art does not become something social in
              | overcoming these conventions, thus the shared point of departure, but rather it
              | always already is something social by virtue of these conventions" (HANTELMANN,
              | 2007b, p.9; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [7]
              | In contrast to the questions asked by HANTELMANN—"What kind of a situation
              | does an artwork produce? How does it situate a viewer? What values,
              | conventions, ideologies and meanings are inscribed in this situation?" (2007a,
              | p.415) Meaning-production in art is not exclusively located in the artwork. In order
              | to better understand the performative aspects of art, we must look at artists'
              | practices. It is in the doing that the performative is revealed. The context of
              | artworks is becoming increasingly complex and open to different interpretations in
              | an open horizon of understanding. Art shows the objectivity of its elements in an
              | intermedial way, because it is thematizing in itself the social, cultural and spatial
              | context of its emergence.
              | "Instead of producing an identity, [works of art] are intelligible by power of their
              | function. Not what something is, that is what it constitutes, appears to be relevant, but
              | rather how it happens in a performative way, and what effects it induces.
              | Correspondingly, the art concepts assign to the arts a site that crosses all dimensions
              | of figuration and form. Specifically, this lends a new contour to the concept of art.
              | What this means is that it is not what we get to see or hear that is most relevant—the
              | specificity of materials, the subtle changes of forms, the distinctions between sounds
              | —but rather, the performance of a transitionality, a performance that requires active
              | participation and the acceptance [of] [by the spectators] immediate responsibility. For
              | it is not an underlying thing, nor again a structure, but rather a process" (MERSCH,
              | 2006, p.222; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [8]
              | The current debate in philosophical aesthetics over performativity no longer
              | diagnoses the relevance of orders of knowledge of social systems in the same
              | way that BERGER and LUCKMANN (1966) did in the "social construction of
              | reality." Rather, this debate examines orders of justification (BOLTANSKI &
              | THÉVENOT, 2006), which suggest a shift of the systems of knowledge.
              | According to SCHÜTZE, "the landscape of knowledge" has become "increasingly
              | confusing: [...] ever more fluid, more multi-aspectual, more concurrent and
              | contradictory, more theoretical and reflexive" (2002, p.59; translated by Gerrit
              | JACKSON). Since the 1970s, qualitative ethnographic studies have been
              | © 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/
              | FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"
              | conducted in research settings in the natural sciences (for instance by
              | GARFINKEL, LATOUR, LYNCH, and KNORR-CETINA), in order to detect
              | possible interdependencies and influences between highly technologically
              | developed research procedures and the communication between researchers
              | (MONDADA & SCHÜTZE, 2004). In order to examine the production of science in
              | its own communicative contexts, such studies have addressed local settings of
              | work and interaction as well as the contingent practices of action, interaction and
              | communication. Such studies of the social world, as developed by symbolic
              | interactionists such as STRAUSS, have given rise to Actor Network Theory
              | (ANT), ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the sociolinguistic analysis
              | of communicative interaction. Studies of the social worlds of scientists have
              | envisaged those activities "during whose performance the objects of knowledge
              | change," as concerning the "production, configuration, arrangement of technical
              | instruments in research" or resulting from the inclusion of "concrete processes of
              | the search for objects in research practice" (MONDADA & SCHÜTZE, 2004,
              | p.141; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). The increasing reflexivity (LYNCH, 2000)
              | of the practice of qualitative research is heightened by a reflection on the
              | involvement of the researcher in the process of research. [9]
              | Drawing on Actor Network Theory, sociologists such as LATOUR (1999a) show
              | how, through chains of translation within the laboratory situation, initial
              | propositions are transformed step by step so as to generate "facts." As the object
              | of a scientific discourse passes through these chains of translation, it must prove
              | its permanence and resistance as a "network fact" while investigating natural
              | science. LATOUR calls such a discursive object a movable immutable (mobile
              | immutable) if this object has become irreversible, having stabilized itself as an
              | object of knowledge (MONDADA, 2004). Thus, discursive objects, after
              | MONDADA, engender "a public version of the world by indicating its adequacy to
              | the intersubjective and social relations among the participants as well as to the
              | social context in which this public version of the world is being framed" (2004,
              | p.184; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [10]
              | LATOUR, a sociologist, works as a curator as well. Together with the curator,
              | OBRIST, (mounting the exhibition "Laboratorium" or the distinction between the
              | inside and the outside of a laboratory), LATOUR sees this work as "not so easy
              | to trace anymore," because "we are all working more or less in a laboratory. If we
              | don't do experiments ourselves, others do experiments on us" (LATOUR, 1999b,
              | p.185). Through its "Theatre of Proof"—a part of the exhibition, the audience
              | participated in the practice of science. The designated result was that "the
              | audience will have a better grasp of what to expect from scientific experiments"
              | (LATOUR 1999b, p.185). My view on art and science is different, because I
              | create a performative experimental situation in radio studios that is not
              | comparable with experiments in natural science in order to investigate how artists
              | involve participants in their art-in-process. [11]
              | The concept of performativity in philosophical aesthetics is too firmly bound up
              | with a concept of works by performative artists that masks the fact that artists are
              | both those who realize their works and those who place this realization in a

              | historical context of becoming. Discourses about art and artistic procedures are
              | not characterized by communicative activities that discursively engender
              | discursive objects or aim to produce agreement on a public version of the world.
              | In order to understand what art is, aesthetic theories have been developed that
              | resemble each other in that they examine art as their object. In addition,
              | experimental art foregrounds the object-hood of its elements and thus works
              | across media, addressing spatial, social and cultural contexts. The exhibition
              | space becomes part of the art, just as the viewer's recognition is constitutive of the
              | work. Modernist theories of art that are based on the presumption of the autonomy
              | of art no longer comprehend the hybrid formations within its resultant works.
              | These hybrid formations in contemporary artistic production indicate a paradigm
              | shift, seen by REBENTISCH, not as a radical renunciation of modern categories
              | and specifically of the category of aesthetic autonomy, but rather "as a
              | determinate negation of a specific notion of aesthetic autonomy, a notion, to be
              | precise, that is understood in objectivistic terms."5 [12]
              | This is, according to REBENTISCH (in HERRSCHAFT, 2004, p.2; translated by
              | Gerrit JACKSON), an understanding of art
              | "in which the object is conceived as independent of the viewer and the context, so
              | that a different understanding of aesthetic autonomy can result from it. To that extent,
              | art, as it were, challenges philosophy to revise this central category of its discourse,
              | namely, the category of autonomy." [13]
              | The aesthetic experience of art cannot occur outside of the viewer's experiential
              | structure. It is a specific process that is not localized within the subject alone but
              | rather in the tense relationship between subject and object. In REBENTISCH's
              | view, installation art develops socially relevant lines of questioning and rejects
              | ideological imputations that the latter are an instrument of debates over identity
              | politics or social theory, contributing to a discourse analysis—imputations that
              | proceed to negate art as art.
              | "As art works, they differ from all of this by being constitutively open in their meaning.
              | Neither for the works nor for their individual elements can we identify one single
              | definitive context that could guarantee a conclusive understanding of them"
              | (REBENTISCH, 2003, p.275; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [14]
              | The tense relationship between a representation and that which is represented is
              | indissoluble, and enters into a specific process of understanding that, far from
              | disposing over it, is an experimental process. It seems as though a conversation
              | has begun in the meantime between artists and their interpreters because artistic
              | works have become interactive and performative. Yet, is this conversation truly
              | taking place? Are discourses about art being developed in collaboration with the
              | artists? Or is aesthetics, in the end, still nothing but the regime serving the
              | identification of art, as RANCIÈRE (2006) calls it, so that art can be designated

              | as art when it has spoken out as socially relevant and questions if art is societal
              | commitment or not? Aesthetic objects can in no way be defined outside of a
              | discourse; in this definition, they engender their substantial content by virtue of
              | which they are integrated into the subjects' processes of understanding. "Even
              | more: aesthetic experience seems capable of attaining a certain intensity, and
              | hence also quality, only when the contents that are put in aesthetic play are of
              | import to the experiencing subject" (REBENTISCH, 2003, p.279; translated by
              | Gerrit JACKSON). Due to the import of the aesthetic experience, one can say
              | that art works are constitutively processual. This processuality is constitutively
              | related to the aesthetic experience. If artistic action is distinguished by
              | participation, since it is only through the inclusion of the viewers that the artistic
              | work is constituted, then artistic modes of action and the entanglement of artistic
              | production in the social world are of decisive importance to an understanding of
              | artistic productivity. Because of their own cognitive interests, performative artists
              | doing experimental art, have become migrants between these two worlds.
              | "Art ought not to wish to apologize for its being constitutively associated with a
              | practice that is capable neither of direct translation into action nor of immediate
              | transformation into cognition. Art opens up a specific experience; an experience, to
              | be precise, of distance, of an unsettling of the interpretive approach to the aesthetic
              | object. In a certain respect, this distance indeed manifests a distance of the aesthetic
              | from practical or theoretical purposes" (REBENTISCH, 2003, p.279; translated by
              | Gerrit JACKSON). [15]
              | 4. Performativity in Interviews with Performative Artists
              | Narrative interviews with artists in radio studios do not fit the classical template of
              | qualitative sociological research. Given the intermedia working alliance on which
              | these interviews are based, one may see parallels with the procedures of
              | performative social science studies. The latter are understood as performance
              | (JONES, 2006) enacted in the practice of doing and performing reflexive
              | interviews (DENZIN, 2003, p.200). DENZIN understands the performative to be
              | "the present moment [...] defined by a performative sensibility, by a willingness to
              | experiment with different ways of presenting an interview text. The performative
              | sensibility turns interviews into performance texts, into poetic monologues. It turns
              | interviewees into performers, into persons whose words and narratives are then
              | performed by others" (DENZIN, 2001, p.25). [16]
              | According to JONES, performative social science is "a science that includes more
              | emphasis on collaborations with our research participant co-authors, co-
              | producers or co-performers themselves" (JONES, 2006, p.7). [17]
              | Recognition of proximity in forms of life and a critique of traditional forms of life
              | are starting points for cooperative work with performative artists because those
              | artists establish an egalitarian relationship with anyone who seeks to investigate
              | them. Their claim to autonomy means that they cannot be made into an object of
              | research. Autonomy is, in my understanding, getting stronger because of the way
              | © 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/
              | FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"
              | artworks are changing and the way artists invent social interaction as part of the
              | art world. In the following, I show parallels of how a researcher can understand
              | artistic worlds and how this can be related to performative social science. [18]
              | 4.1 Lawrence: Performing biographies
              | The interview with Lawrence6, a 24-year old artist from England, was conducted
              | as a live broadcast at a radio station7. A day earlier, he had executed a live
              | performance at the same studio. The interview refers to this performance and to
              | the family stories that were integrated into the artist's performance, running
              | simultaneously with a slide show, and presented as the objects of a narrative.
              | During the radio performance, the narrative itself became the object of the artist's
              | presentation as he started to accelerate the narrative again and again and, at the
              | end of the piece, summarized the narrative, which had been developed over the
              | course of an hour, in one minute, as though in time-lapse. During the interview,
              | descriptions and argumentation predominated. Based on the description, an
              | image emerges of what artists like Lawrence do and how artists proceed in their
              | work. [19]
              | The process of reflection on the artist's own work as an analysis of the work, is
              | interwoven with the material, and a reality in its own right is constituted. The
              | artistic position, which also contains autobiographical material, playfully and
              | inventively alters it. This permits the reconstruction of the knowledge-producing
              | procedure that engenders an artistic position. MANNHEIM (2005/1936) calls
              | intellectual processes that are inventive-altering inventive thinking. With respect
              | to the performative character of the interview with Lawrence, this can be
              | understood as an explanation of artistic cognitive processes.8 For Lawrence this
              | process consists in searching and finding. He explains this as another form of
              | translation:
              | "but I do—I do do watercolour paintings as a part of one project which is the 'Finding
              | in ... In Search of ... project', and one of the main themes in this whole work was
              | about translation and different methods of translation and how can that be
              | incorporated in daily activity, thus watercolour painting was also another translation"
              | (Lawrence, 2006 II.24-27). [20]
              | By describing how he creates an artwork, his biography is performed and
              | integrated into his process of presentation. In earlier artistic forms, this occurred
              | only in the form of autobiography (for instance, in GOETHE's "Dichtung und
              | Wahrheit" ["Poetry and Truth"] (1981/1830), but did not become a central medium
              | of presentation. Here, it is addressed as a problem within the narrative. The

              | 8 "In any case, this stage proves that the capacity for abstraction springs from a higher level of
              | activity than that of chance discovery—i.e., from the stage of inventive thinking" (MANNHEIM,
              | 2005, pp.206-207). See also BARBOZA (2005), where she describes the experimental forms of
              | science in MANNHEIM's understanding of sociology. I would suggest here MANNHEIM's
              | sociology as an early approach to PSS.

              | distinction between the author and the bearer of the narrative becomes
              | problematic. Lawrence communicates the identity of an artist and a narrator who
              | presents himself to the public, and simultaneously that of someone who has
              | authentically experienced something, who is the bearer of the story. The frame of
              | argumentation is rendered conscious to the point of an explicit experience and
              | the development of an authentic artistic identity. Ordinary daily activities, which
              | had previously been masked are employed, and connected to his frame of trans-
              | dispositions, a procedure that can be understood as an archeology of the
              | framework, as the performance uses interlocking and alienated perspectives in
              | order to generate a more authentic picture of Lawrence's work. MERSCH calls
              | these forms of action archeologies of the performative: [21]
              | "The creative act itself, as it suddenly emerges from processes of intermedia
              | performance" (MERSCH, 2006, p.222) is an assertion of artistic actions.
              | Concepts begin to supplant the mere image, and this must be understood as an
              | act of liberation. "Such assertions, as events, are irreversible: once they have
              | been put forth into the world, a fissure appears in them that rests on a force that
              | cannot be undone, one that simultaneously evokes the possibility of a 'different
              | beginning' " (ibid., 2006, p.222; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [22]
              | The spectator/participant is enabled in order to engage in processes of
              | understanding during the performance. Artists like Lawrence shift the
              | predetermined frame like white cubes in galleries or museums spaces and
              | develop their own mechanisms in order to find and mediatize their own discursive
              | arenas. To this end, artists choose their own historical perspectives on their
              | procedures in order to identify traditional notions of art and transpose their works
              | into new paradigms. They have a need of their own historiography in order to
              | define for themselves their position within art history, and to interrogate it with
              | respect to formal circumstances.9 [23]
              | Lawrence contemplates fragility in saying,
              | "If I said, for example, if I sit in this institutional space and I perform, not to say that is
              | a form of an emotional or intimate exchange but, uhm, I think it really does—it shifts
              | not only the meaning of the work but also only one thing that is definitely in question
              | is the fragility of it. For example, the project, it is very delicate and fragile now if I
              | funnel it through a medium such as radio it completely shifts what you could say the
              | essence of it and at the same time things like repetition or these performative
              | approaches can easily be executed and used very well through something like radio.
              | But things such as a personal sentiment or a very kind of fragile narrative or complexity
              | can only be spent upon and developed basically through an engagement with someone
              | who is also reciprocating that" (2006, II.362-372). [24]
              | 9 "But there are other phenomena as well that—such as Georges Mathieu's informel—must be
              | understood less as themselves than as documentation or traces of a creative act, traces in
              | which a handwriting is manifest and that address their production as the act of an individual,
              | lyric subjectivity" (IMDAHL, 1996, p.135; translated by Gerrit JACKSON).

              | A difference10 is moreover being produced that cannot be understood simply as
              | activity. In this difference, the presence of the work is manifest. Lawrence
              | sustains his narratives within the interrelation, or framing (difference), of facts and
              | stories. [25]
              | In the following section of the interview, Lawrence begins to ponder the
              | conditions of the constitution of his own work—to survey them.
              | "And if you bump into me in a train station or in a bus or strolling through a gallery
              | and I perform a story ... there is always a framework, the framework is the bus or the
              | framework is the gallery, but the point is the framework does not make a specific kind
              | of relationship to my biography, it doesn't say 'on the bus between these hours'.
              | Lawrence will perform a story to you" (2006, II.379-383). [26]
              | An institutional framework such as a radio broadcasting studio can destroy the
              | situation of narration, one that is for him very fragile and intimate, because the
              | narrator is identified with his biographical data. The performative act of the work
              | can be destroyed because the reciprocity and the direction of the narration
              | toward a listener is absent, even as listeners are present. The rhetorical assertion
              | of narrative thus vitiates the narrator's disposition. [27]
              | In the radio situation, Lawrence experiences the disappearance of his own
              | presence as an artist. His explanation for this disappearance resembles the
              | situation he experienced during his studies when he sought to overcome the
              | flatness of his photographs by telling stories while standing next to the slide
              | projector. The reflection on his presence, as he reclaims the latter, is part of his
              | artistic becoming:
              | "I like that, but in the radio, that notion of fact and fiction of how do I come to this? It is
              | gone, because it is obvious I am coming into your life, because you are driving a car
              | listening to the radio, you are switching on and you hear it and who did that that it was
              | this guy, bang—it is over, it kills it in some ways" (2006, II.405-408). [28]
              | Justifying, defending, and pondering in which context and under which conditions
              | a work can be staged or sold is part of the economic order of the art world, an
              | order toward which Lawrence, as an art student, cannot but take a position. A
              | work in a medium such as the radio broadcast is accessible to many listeners. At
              | the time of the radio broadcast, the market potential of the performance was
              | unclear; Lawrence refused to make the broadcast available for download from the
              | Internet. Not until half a year later was a limited edition record of the performance
              | produced as part of an exhibition. Lawrence apprehension was that his
              | performance could become liable to exploitation by the culture industry11. On the

              | "In addition, revisiting the collaboration between the narrator and researcher within our
              | biographic investigations also deserves to be fore grounded in a 'performative' way, to include
              | involving research participants in the production and dissemination of their own stories" (2006,
              | p.7).

              | 4.2 Micky: Performing a sphere of approximation
              | Micky12 is an 34 year old artist from South Africa. We met the first time at a radio
              | show organized by an art student who curated an art students' exhibition. When
              | the show started, the students were drinking beer.

              | IDRIZI, a photojournalist from Prishtina, was invited to the radio studio as well to
              | make some images of the participants. The curated exhibition was about stars.
              | They made a postcard and a catalog with drawings. Each participant created
              | her/his own star. In the radio studio, they felt and behaved like stars. Some had
              | prepared sound works and some played music as well. The six participants in the
              | show presented their works one after the other accompanied by comments,
              | laughing and shouting as they progressively became drunker. A female artist had
              | a sound work on DUCHAMP: she played a recorded wee-wee and the audience
              | listened to it as a gender critique on the male form of the work "Fontaine" from
              | DUCHAMP.
              | When Micky presented his work, a performance in a shopping center in Frankfurt,
              | he was interrupted by another art student who was speaking louder and louder in
              | translating his English phrases into German as he tried to explain his artwork.

              | It was very difficult for me to follow his performance and, towards the end, the
              | situation in the radio studio escalated more and more. At the end of the show the
              | students all started to scream without any interest and respect for others. At the
              | same time they had fun in creating an uncontrolled situation.

              | Because of the interruption during the radio show, I met Micky again in a cafe to
              | talk with him about his performances. His work is related to the political situation
              | in Post-Apartheid South Africa and being a social activist influences his

              | performances.13 He studied Sociology in the 1990s in South Africa, when he
              | started walking. "I used to go on walks in the early 1990s I used to go for like four
              | days, wake up in the middle of the night and then go for a walk, you know, out
              | into the bush, out of the town and that was a few times when I used to write
              | poetry about my experience, the homeless people I would meet, I gave like one
              | man on the street everything I had, you know, a jacket, everything" (Micky, 2008,
              | II.139-141). After he came to Germany, Micky tried to sort out his position in the
              | world by defining "who" he was. It was when he went to a drawing course that he
              | realized his need for this "definition." For example, it was through his art practice
              | that he could connect his first performances as an artistic practice:
              | "... and today, knowing more, I realized that this could be interpreted as performance
              | of course, I didn't see the connection I think that I mean I don't want to put too much
              | focus on the walks because they weren't very many of them and this is just an
              | example for my first kind of what I would now think about my artistic entrance
              | perhaps" (Micky, 2008, II.212-217). [33]
              | A performance for Micky allows him to test his own boundaries. Thus, he is
              | asking the public for 10 seconds of their time, to perform. "How much do I need
              | and of course how much space do I need but the focal one it was me" (Micky,
              | 2008, II.294-295). [34]
              | Importantly, Micky realized that it was through artistic expression as performance
              | that he could transform himself. At the same time, Micky also realized what art is
              | for him: "... a personal transformation which automatically becomes a social
              | transformation" (ibid. II.187). He is now doing performances as his main genre of
              | work; this is because it is possible in a performance to create mirrors for the
              | participants. Very important for the notion of proximity is that someone has to
              | come to him, he is waiting; this is automatically reflected in that observers of his
              | performance are part of the performance and he is reflecting whether they need it
              | or not: "if I place myself in the public a social need is there, it will be addressed by
              | the person who comes to me, otherwise they wouldn't come to me" (Micky, 2008,
              | II.226-227). Micky realized in doing performances that he is positioned in and
              | possibly positioned against the art world. For example, he felt increasingly bored
              | seeing the same kinds of exhibitions. For him, art has many functions and he
              | rejects being another artist who is over intellectualizing art works while ignoring
              | the transformational power of performative art. "For me to create something I
              | believe in transformational power of everyday things like taking the U-Bahn or like
              | greeting your neighbor" (Micky, 2008, II.268-270). The artwork is for Micky the
              | moment one person has with him: "May be it is 20 seconds or it is ... and then it is
              | gone. And it is always there and then gone it is like a heartbeat it comes and it
              | goes, it is a kind of a social rhythm it is a kind of a rhythm" (Micky, 2008, II.281-
              | 283). [35]
              | 13 See also the explanation in DENZIN (2003) of the call to performance in addressing matters of
              | racial injustice. The demand for a critical pedagogy lies for him in "a performative, pedagogical
              | politics of hope [that] imagines a radically free democratic society, a society where the ideals of
              | feminist, queer, environmental, green, civil rights, and labor movements are realized" (2003,
              | pp.5-6).

              | Thanks to participatory approaches, the artistic sphere is no longer dependent on
              | traditional models of representation. "They are not so much about the vicarious
              | illustration of a problem, an [aesthetic] experience, or an idea of a community, but
              | rather about directly realizing a multidisciplinary cooperation" (HÖLLER, 2007,
              | p.410). Consequently artistic processes of proximity and participation have
              | moved increasingly into the foreground in the production of works. "Participation
              | includes the entire spectrum of behaviours a recipient can exhibit towards an
              | object, project or exhibition ambience" (ibid., p.410). The participatory claims in
              | the works of artists have become essential to an understanding of a participatory
              | public. "Participation in its current form aims to create new collectives and to
              | create ephemeral communities of action and interest, without an ongoing
              | identificatory basis" (ibid., p.410). What is sublated in the question of artistic
              | participation is the distance between artistic modes of action and the recipients.
              | The question of participation is a consequence of a changed understanding of the
              | political, with renewed and urgent importance. Participation, representation, and
              | constitution are interlocked; according to GERHARDT (2007), they form a triangle
              | within which the political moves. This political notion is engaged in a process of
              | boundary dissolution, thereby moving toward its own margins. This form of
              | boundary dissolution is comparable to the delineation and critique of the
              | Verfransung [marginal blurring or wandering] of the arts given by ADORNO14 in
              | his essay "Die Kunst und die Künste":
              | "The Verfransung of the arts is a false demise of art. Its inevitable illusory character
              | becomes scandalous in the face of the overwhelming power of an economic and
              | political reality that transforms the aesthetic appearance, even as an idea, into a
              | mockery because it no longer permits any perspective toward the realization of the
              | aesthetic content. This is less and less compatible with the principle of rational
              | command of the materials with which that content had allied itself throughout the
              | history of art" (ADORNO, 2006, p.208; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [36]
              | 5. Conclusion
              | Reflexivity and heightened complexity are recognizable features of the institutions
              | of art, art schools and museums, and of exhibition practices. The substantive
              | content of artistic work is measured by knowledge of institutional practices and by
              | how artists reflect and transform these practices in their works. One
              | emancipatory move that artists are currently engaged in consists of addressing
              | their knowledge of the means necessary in order to have their own history as
              | artists and artistic agency recognized in this process. Moreover, given the
              | incalculability of the art system, strategies of action such as the creation of
              | networks of informal relations are being developed in order to compensate for
              | uncertainties. The engagement of the artist's own cognitive interests becomes a
              | social marker of his or her professionalism and of the performativity of the works
              | created. ALHEIT understands aesthetic reflexivity as a potential present when
              | autobiographical texts show references to aesthetic experience and to aesthetic
              | procedures. "Aesthetic reflexivity" has become, for ALHEIT and BRANDT, "an
              | 14 See also ADORNO (1997) and de DUVE (2006).

              | exemplar of distance and approximation, of the autonomization of aesthetic
              | experience and of a renewed ties to other orders of experience" (2006, p.302;
              | translated by Gerrit JACKSON). The substantial novelty of this form of
              | autobiographical self-presentation resides in the fact that "the question regarding
              | the type of autobiography becomes a matter of little importance" (ibid., p.25;
              | translated by Gerrit JACKSON). The self-presentation of one's life stands at the
              | center of literary autobiographies no longer subsumable under existing patterns
              | of order, offering "instead the potential to develop substantially new forms" (ibid.
              | p.25; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). According to ALHEIT and BRANDT, the
              | configuration of the orders of knowledge has changed, and relationships with the
              | world and with oneself are capable of an expanded perception on the basis of the
              | potential space of biographical reflexivity. Questions of one's own social
              | responsibility and connectedness thus come to the foreground. "Aesthetic reflec-
              | tions are integrated within other orders of reflection, and only this gives rise to the
              | entirety of the pattern that is here called aesthetic reflexivity" (ibid., p.298;
              | translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [37]
              | The fact is that, after the modern individual has been rendered capable of being
              | defined, identity is a characteristic of social change. Lawrence takes this up in his
              | work by addressing biographical points of reference and pointing out the social
              | constructedness of these points of reference through the interruptions and
              | accelerations he employs during his narration. This reality is transitive because
              | the mode of narrative is performatively used to establish a communicative
              | situation involving the listener-viewer that is open to subsequent communication.
              | This process does not resolve into an act of interpretation, but into participation in
              | his performance. Micky justifies his role as a performer in creating a space for the
              | autonomy of his artistic position. For both Lawrence and Micky, the approximation
              | to the performance and how the audience is coming to it could be destroyed if
              | there is too much proximity or too much intellectualization about what they are
              | doing as well as through over-interpretation of their works. A rupture would then
              | destroy the relation to simple everyday interactions and understanding of art. In
              | this direction, definitions of art could learn to fly. [38]
              | What does the artistic interaction with one's own biography and understanding of
              | performative art show? The power of art to resist an analytic approach; a power
              | that consists in breaking open the frameworks of research, and thus securing the
              | autonomy of a work that is not at anyone's disposal. With respect to the
              | intersection between biographical research, interpretive social science, and
              | philosophical aesthetics, "learning to fly" means adopting a perspective such as
              | that developed in performative social science so that conversations with artists
              | can begin. I see here one precondition for a more substantial working alliance
              | with artists that, rather than limiting itself to cultural-industrial critique, seeks to
              | understand social change explained by artists. [39]
