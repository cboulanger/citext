              | Abstract
              | Background Health economic parameters are increasingly
              | considered as variables in health care decisions, but
              | decision makers are interested in country-specific evalua-
              | tions. However, a large number of studies are performed in
              | foreign countries or in a multinational setting, which limits
              | the transferability to a single nation’s context.
              | Objective The present analysis summarises several of the
              | most common international methods for generating health
              | economic analyses based on clinical studies from different
              | settings.
              | Methods A narrative literature review was performed to
              | identify potential reasons for limited transferability of
              | health economic evaluation results from one country to
              | another. Based on these results, we searched the method-
              | ological literature for analytic approaches to handle the
              | restrictions. Additionally we describe the possibility of
              | transferring foreign economic study results to the country

              | national databases.
              | Results The main factors for limited transferability of
              | health economic findings were found in country-specific
              | differences in resource consumption and the resulting costs.
              | These differences are affected by a number of influencing
              | cofactors (demography, epidemiology and individual
              | patient’s factors) and the overall health care system
              | structures (e.g. payment systems, health provider incentives).
              | However, despite the limitations country-specific health
              | economic assessments could be realised using the pooled/
              | split analyses approach, some statistical approaches and
              | modelling approaches.
              | Conclusion A variety of methods for identifying and
              | adjusting country-specific differences in costs, effects and
              | cost-effectiveness was established during the past decades.
              | Multinational studies will continue to play a crucial role in
              | the evaluation of cost-effectiveness at national levels. It
              | seems likely that the growing interest in multinational
              | studies will lead to continued developments in adaptation
              | methods.

              | Background
              | The results of health economic evaluations are of growing
              | interest to political decision makers and insurance pro-
              | viders, not least because of increasingly tight budgets in the
              | health care sector. To meet this new interest, clinical trials
              | are increasingly taking into account resource and cost
              | parameters (Drummond et al. 1997). In Germany economic
              | aspects are becoming more important in the assessment of
meta          | 328
text          | new therapies. Moreover, numerous methodological stand-
              | ards have been developed in recent years, which aim to
              | ensure that the results of clinical studies are less open to
              | bias. In addition, regulatory authorities tend to favour
              | designs in which at least a minority of subjects in trials
              | have been recruited in the host country, although they
              | remain generally content with the fact that only a minority
              | of subjects may actually be drawn from their country. Thus,
              | international multicentre study designs have become a key
              | component of clinical trial programmes (Demol and
              | Weihrauch 1997).
              | Multinational studies have numerous advantages over
              | single-nation studies. In particular, the large geographical
              | areas involved allow investigators to recruit sizable numbers
              | of patients in a relatively short period of time, and the quality
              | of evidence may be improved by virtue of regional variations
              | in the patient mix (Manca and Willan 2006; Sculpher et al.
              | 2004; Drummond and Pang 2001). Multinational studies also
              | have important caveats. Chief among these is the difficulty
              | of transferring study findings to the level of individual
              | national health care systems. After all, national decision
              | makers are primarily interested in the results a study would
              | have yielded if it had been conducted in their own
              | jurisdiction.
              | Clinical trials are normally designed on the assumption
              | of a common treatment effect across different strata, for
              | example by centre or by country. It is well understood that
              | patient characteristics and thus the absolute effects of
              | treatment may vary between centres, and it is common to
              | use some form of stratified randomisation to ensure an
              | approximate balance of treatment and control subjects
              | within centres or regions. The analysis of clinical trials
              | usually involves some degree of examination of subgroups,
              | although the aim is normally to support the assumption that
              | there is a single treatment effect, and there is considerable
              | controversy when it becomes apparent that this assumption
              | may not be supported (Reed et al. 2005). The question of
              | transferability becomes very apparent, however, when we
              | consider economic parameters, for these—in contrast to
              | clinical outcomes—are subject to considerable country-
              | specific variability (Asplund et al. 2003; Jönsson and
              | Weinstein 1997; Drummond and Pang 2001). Despite
              | recent efforts to develop methodological standards for
              | dealing with the resulting uncertainties, it is surprising to
              | see that economic analyses are still being conducted
              | without paying consideration to the issues raised when
              | transferring the findings of multinational studies to national
              | settings (Halliday and Darba 2003).
              | According to the most recent German health care reform
              | act from April 2007, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency
              | in Health Care (IQWiG) can be assigned to evaluate not
              | only the effects of a medical intervention according to
              | international standards of evidence-based medicine, but
              | J Public Health (2010) 18:327–335
              | also the balance between benefits in the national health care
              | setting according to international standards of health
              | economics. In this context the question of transferring or
              | adopting the findings of multinational trials to an actual
              | national context will be a question of the methodological
              | framework the IQWiG is currently about to implement.
              | Objectives
              | The present analysis summarises several of the most
              | common international methods for generating health eco-
              | nomic assessments based on clinical studies from different
              | settings; it also provides an overview of potential new
              | approaches to this subject from the perspective of Germany.
              | In recent years, the problem of transferability has become
              | increasingly important in this country. These developments
              | raise the question of the extent to which the advantages of
              | multinational studies can be reconciled with the need for
              | unlimited transferability when adapting the findings of
              | these studies to a specific national context.
              | Methods
              | A narrative literature review was performed to identify
              | potential reasons for limited transferability of results of
              | health economic evaluation from one country to another.
              | Although we used some relevant single search terms (e.g.
              | “transferability”) and search term combinations [e.g. “trans-
              | ferability” AND “cost-benefit analysis (MeSH term)”], the
              | search procedure was not based on a systematic approach.
              | Based on these results, we further searched the methodo-
              | logical literature for analytic approaches to handle the
              | restrictions. Additionally we described the possibility of
              | transferring foreign economic study results to the country
              | of interest by matching trial data with routine data from
              | national databases.
              | Results
              | Reasons for limited transferability
              | The transferability of cost and effectiveness results obtained
              | in multinational studies to national contexts can be limited
              | by a large number of factors (Bryan and Brown 1998;
              | Koopmanschap et al. 2001; Manca and Willan 2006). Here,
              | it is important to keep in mind that problems related to
              | transferability affect primarily economic findings (e.g.
              | resources or costs). A number of authors have described
              | the sources of limited transferability (Drummond and Pang
              | 2001; Koopmanschap et al. 2001; O’Brien 1997; Pang
              | J Public Health (2010) 18:327–335
              | 2002); some of these are briefly presented in the following
              | section:
              | Differences in demography, epidemiology and individual
              | patient characteristics
              | It is well known that individual patient characteristics have
              | at least an indirect influence on the effectiveness and cost-
              | effectiveness of any given intervention (Kaplan and Keil
              | 1993). Examples include socioeconomic or demographic
              | factors, both of which may exhibit systematic country-
              | specific differences in terms of their extent or degree. For
              | instance, it is conceivable that patients in one country may
              | show significant differences in educational attainment or
              | wealth compared to patients in the other countries taking
              | part in the same multinational study. This problem can be
              | addressed, where applicable, by defining strict inclusion
              | criteria (Koopmanschap et al. 2001). Patient-reported out-
              | comes are also subject to regional variations and thus may
              | also influence the evaluation of a treatment’s cost-
              | effectiveness (O’Brien 1997). The same can be said for
              | regional differences in the incidence and prevalence of a
              | particular disease. For instance, high prevalence of a
              | disease in a certain country or region may lead to
              | downstream experience curve effects on the part of local
              | health care providers. In turn, high incidence of a disease
              | can increase the cost-effectiveness of a given population-
              | wide preventive measure (Koopmanschap et al. 2001). The
              | disease incidence and the level of patients’ comorbidities
              | will also be influenced by the age structure of a specific
              | country’s population (Drummond and Pang 2001).
              | Differences in country-specific health care and analysis
              | structures
              | Additional factors that can limit the transferability of study
              | results from one country to another can be traced to differences
              | in the design and organisation of health care systems. Examples
              | include differing systems of physician reimbursement and
              | related incentive schemes (Koopmanschap et al. 2001;
              | Drummond and Pang 2001) as well as differences in pricing
              | (Drummond and Pang 2001). In Germany, the method and
              | amount of physician reimbursement are based on consensus
              | agreements reached by the National Associations of Health
              | Insurance Funds and the National Associations of Social
              | Health Insurance-accredited Physicians. In contrast, the remu-
              | neration of medical services in the USA is based on negotiated
              | contracts with health maintenance organisations (HMOs) or
              | other payers. For example, due to these differences, the US
              | hospital care section is associated with comparably higher
              | costs, which may lead to a higher utilisation in other health care
              | areas (e.g. community services) in order to avoid the high
              | hospitalisation expenditures (Pang 2002).
meta          | 329
text          | A striking example of the relevance of varying unit costs
              | may be the choice of a cost-effective clinical pathway for
              | patients with peptic ulcer disease and dyspepsia. These
              | conditions are known to be associated with Helicobacter
              | pylori infection, and eradication of this bacterium has been
              | shown to be an effective treatment strategy. H. pylori
              | infection can be diagnosed by means of endoscopy or, less
              | reliably, by non-invasive laboratory tests. The cost-
              | effectiveness of initial diagnosis of H. pylori infection by
              | means of gastroscopy appears to be highly sensitive to the
              | unit cost of the endoscopic procedure, which is much
              | higher in the USA compared to European conventions
              | (Bytzer 1999; Moayyedi 2007). As a consequence of this
              | difference in cost, a clinical management strategy starting
              | with initial endoscopy has been described as a cost-
              | effective option in Europe, whereas in the USA empirical
              | antisecretory treatment or non-invasive H. pylori testing
              | were identified as preferable options based on their cost-
              | effectiveness (Bytzer 1999).
              | Apart from unit costs, differences in country-specific
              | methods (upon which the economic evaluation is based)
              | could potentially influence the results of an economic
              | assessment. For example the cost-effectiveness perspective
              | could lead to different findings regarding the cost-
              | effectiveness of a treatment. Was an analysis performed
              | out of a societal perspective including all indirect costs or
              | from the point of view of a single health care participant
              | (e.g. health insurance company)? Even if an analysis was
              | performed from the well-chosen perspective of interest, the
              | possibility for a single-country adaptation could be limited.
              | For example the economic evaluation results of a therapy
              | from the perspective of a social insurance system will be
              | deeply influenced by the structure of this system. Such a
              | social insurance system could include a health care
              | insurance, pension insurance, nursing insurance etc. or just
              | a part of these services.
              | There are also country-specific differences in patient care
              | pathways, which are partly shaped by guidelines estab-
              | lished by national medical associations or differently
              | organised educational systems for health care professionals.
              | Further limits on transferability can result from differences
              | in the fundamental organisational principles of health care
              | systems (e.g. central vs decentralised planning). Other
              | potential problems when transferring the findings of
              | international studies to the national context can be
              | identified in a qualitative manner using checklists, such as
              | that provided in Table 1 (based on Heyland et al. 1996).
              | Approaches to the economic analysis of multinational
              | studies
              | In principle, there are various approaches to address the
              | question of heterogeneity of economic variables across

              | countries in multinational studies. All methodologies aim to
              | translate real study data to an individual country. Under the
              | reasonable assumption that internationally generated results
              | for the effectiveness of a treatment are less subject to
              | differences than cost results (Drummond and Pang 2001),
              | the focus of the following observations is on the adaptation
              | of economic cost results.
              | Provided that data are both available and accessible, in

              | individual data on resource consumption are the basis for both
              | individual cost calculation and a subsequent total cost
              | evaluation (Hay and Jackson 1999). This methodology has
              | the advantage that analysis of resource consumption can be
              | made directly on the basis of the direct cost sets of a specific
              | country. This approach, however, requires detailed individual
              | data.

              | Pooled/split analysis approach
              | Based on this pattern, different sources can be identified to
              | analyse effectiveness and resource data within a multina-
              | tional study. In principle, different combinations are
              | conceivable which are shown in Fig. 2.
              | A completely pooled analysis assumes that there are no
              | restrictions with regard to the adaptation of multinational study
              | results at the level of a specific country. Since this assumption is
              | not very likely as previously noted, the partially pooled,
              | respectively split analysis gains more relevance.
              | With this approach only data of a certain country
              | selection (e.g. with comparable patient clientele and/or
              | health care systems) or a single country concerned are
              | selected for further evaluation. These methodologies are
              | easily comprehensible and thus a high transparency can be
              | achieved for the methods and presentation of results.
              | However, a disadvantage of this approach is the reduced
              | sample size, which, in a fully split analysis, can reduce the
              | significance of the results (Pinto et al. 2005; Reed et al. 2005).
              | In any case, these analytic approaches are only feasible when
              | the country of interest was involved in the study. Figure 3
              | summarises the fundamental problems of pooled and split
              | analyses.
              | In practice, there are often pooled/split analyses in which, on
              | the one hand, pooled effectiveness data of all participating
              | countries are taken into consideration, whereas, on the other
              | hand, only resource data of the country concerned are
              | considered. This approach is a trade-off between a country-
              | based assignment of resources and a high statistical power
              | concerning the effectiveness data (Reed et al. 2005).

              | Statistical approaches
              | Since pooled/split analyses provide a compromise between
              | restriction-free transferability of the study results for a
              | certain country and a high statistical power, during the last
              | few years, statistical analyses have been developed to
              | approximate the optimal compromise. Among these,
              | regression-based approaches belong to the most frequently
              | common statistical methodologies. A potential disadvan-
              | tage of the statistical methods presented is, in part, the
              | complexity of the approach which involves again a reduced
              | transparency, and thus reduces the potential use as a
              | decision making aid (Reed et al. 2005).
              | Hence, a study published by Koopmanschap et al.
              | recommends the use of multivariate regression analyses.
              | This is proposed in order to quantify and adjust differ-
              | ences in resource consumption and costs in multinational
              | studies in a way such that the studies would have been
              | carried out in only one country (Koopmanschap et al.
              | 2001). Herewith two options were pursued. A first

              | resources of the countries involved in order to form
              | homogeneous patient groups afterwards as precisely as
              | possible. For all groups of resources, statistically significant
              | and relevant country differences are determined, which are
              | then subject to further correction. For example if in a country
              | ×% less laboratory tests are carried out (with consideration of
              | possible differences in the patient characteristics), the
              | number of laboratory tests of the patients of other
              | countries should be corrected downward by this factor ×.
              | The corrected resource utilisations are then multiplied by a
              | country-specific cost set.
              | A second approach tries to identify a possible country-
              | specific influence directly at a cost expense level. In a
              | multivariate regression analysis, the influence of different
              | covariates (beside the country of the study, e.g. the age of the
              | study participants and the disease status) on certain expenses is
              | examined. A limitation of the proceedings represented by
              | Koopmanschap et al. arises because of the isolated focus on
              | resources and/or expenses, with which possible country-
              | specific effectiveness differences remain unconsidered.

text          | Other authors try to get around this limitation. In a
              | publication of Willke et al. (1998) the attempt is undertaken
              | to identify both country-specific differences in effectiveness
              | and the quantification of differences in resources and cost.
              | The statistical methodology assumes that a number of
              | exogenous variables (e.g. disease stage), therapy outcomes
              | as well as the interaction of country-specific treatment and
              | country-specific outcomes per se influence costs of a
              | treatment of an individual patient by treatment. The
              | proposal described by these authors considered also
              | country-specific outcome differences and thus partially
              | goes beyond existing recommendations [e.g. Ontario
              | Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Pharmaceutical
              | Products (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care
              | 1994)] for the adaptation of multinational studies, because
              | frequently only the consideration of possible country-
              | specific cost and/or resource differences is required.
              | Besides these statistical proposals, further statistical
              | approaches have been generated in recent years (Cook et
              | al. 2003; Grieve et al. 2005; Pinto et al. 2005; Thompson et
              | al. 2006; Willan et al. 2005).
              | Modelling of long-term costs and outcomes
              | In many situations the use of decision analytic models is
              | preferred because it frequently occurs that there are no
              | patient-based data available from the participating centres
              | in the study or that the country of interest did not participate
              | in the study (Drummond et al. 1997). So-called modelling
              | studies enable the adaptation of treatment effects identified
              | at the study level to different populations and health care
              | systems. Often clinical studies are carried out without
              | accompanying collection of economic parameters. An
              | advantage, which the health economic modelling can offer,
              | is the possibility of using and combining data from different
              | sources.
              | For example decision analytic models are nowadays
              | used to adjust study data to the real routine supply or to
              | transfer study results to a country which did not participate
              | in the study. An example of this approach is described in
              | the work of Menzin et al. (1996). The authors use a
              | decision analytic model alongside the data of a phase III
              | study in the USA for adaptation to the European context
              | (France, Italy and Germany).
              | A further type of application of decision analytic
              | models exists in the health economic analysis of clinical
              | studies, during which economic parameters were not
              | collected or were not available. Based on available study
              | information (e.g. characteristics of patient clientele,
              | clinical processes, event rates etc.) resulting resource
              | consumption is identified, on which basis a cost
              | evaluation of the study process could be performed. Via
              | extrapolation, an analysis of long-term costs of inter-
              | J Public Health (2010) 18:327–335
              | ventions or savings due to prevention of events is
              | feasible (Siebert 2003).
              | According to the IQWiG guidelines, the use of a
              | model for the economic evaluation of interventions must
              | be sufficiently justified (Bastian et al. 2006). In addition,
              | a model must meet numerous quality standards. Thus,
              | decision models must be described transparently and
              | comprehensibly and all assumptions must be explained.
              | Likewise, there is a demand for the implementation of
              | sensitivity analyses along with a fully probabilistic
              | approach.
              | Furthermore, decision models should be subject to
              | validation. The mathematical computations must be vali-
              | dated for their consistency with the model specifications,
              | and it must be guaranteed that model input data and the
              | outcomes are consistent with the available data. If different
              | models come to different statements on the same questions,
              | this identifies the necessity for a cross-validation of results
              | (Bastian et al. 2006).
              | Provided that the appropriate quality criteria have been
              | considered, the methodology of current health economic
              | modelling is well established as a subsequent analysis of
              | study data (Sculpher et al. 2004). Most international
              | guidelines accept modelling in health economic evaluation
              | (Hjelmgren et al. 2001; Schöffski and Graf von der
              | Schulenburg 2007), although there remains some scepti-
              | cism regarding the appropriateness of different modelling
              | approaches, especially where these appear to translate
              | unimpressive clinical effects into highly cost-effective
              | outcomes.
              | Transfer of data to a national setting
              | One approach which uses some elements of modelling
              | but adopts the efficacy of one single study of interest—
              | possibly the pivotal key study on which registration was
              | based—is to transfer data of a multinational trial to an
              | existing national data set. A key focus of this approach is
              | the linkage of patient data of the multinational study
              | with patient data from national data based on specific
              | patient characteristics (e.g. age, sex, insurance status,
              | ICD diagnoses etc.). An important prerequisite for the
              | practical implementation of the matching process is
              | therefore the existence of matching variables on the
              | patient level. If an international study delivers patient-
              | level information only on sociodemography and therapy
              | effectiveness, economic data of comparable patients from
              | national databases can be assigned by means of patient
              | matching. Important, however, is the selection of relevant
              | matching variables such as age, sex, disease stages etc.
              | In a following step, differences of effectiveness between
              | the treatment arms are extracted and assessed according
              | to the national cost schedule (e.g. the group difference
              | J Public Health (2010) 18:327–335
              | concerning cardiac events in studies with cardiovascular
              | background).
              | As a result, assessment of national cost-effectiveness can
              | be obtained by matching available patient characteristics
              | from the international trial with the national cost compo-
              | nents. A problem is that the fundamental goal of clinical
              | studies is the proof of the effectiveness of an intervention
              | under controlled conditions (efficacy). Therefore, the
              | collection of economic parameters in such studies is
              | often of less relevance. The matching process illustrated
              | so far would therefore only reflect the cost-effectiveness
              | at the time of the execution of the clinical study in the
              | country concerned (dependence on the related matching
              | database).
              | A transfer of the cost-effectiveness results to the current
              | real life setting would be achieved by incorporating data
              | from national data sources (e.g. health insurance data). The
              | integration of data from automated databases or health
              | service research offers the potential to illustrate current
              | consumption of resources and/or the costs of treatment in
              | everyday life. Owing to specific characteristics of the
              | German health system, this approach could realise both
              | the adaptation to the national context and the consideration
              | of real health care conditions.

text          | Recommended analytic methods
              | Based on the analytic methods described above, a number
              | of recommendations can be made as to which method
              | applies best to which situation. These recommendations are
              | summarised in a flow chart shown in Fig. 4. However, these
              | recommendations cover a restricted range of scenarios only.
              | Indeed, it is very plausible that there are situations in which
              | a method different from those described would be more
              | appropriate.
              | Discussion
              | As the importance of health economic evaluations has grown,
              | so has the number of methodological tools available. Today,
              | broad ranges of approaches are used for the economic analysis
              | of data from multinational studies, including study-based
              | techniques, statistical methods and modelling. Despite this,
              | none of the approaches described above is free of limitations.
              | Finally, choosing a particular method always involves a
              | balancing act between methodological transparency, statistical
              | power and the transferability of results from multinational
              | studies to different settings.

              | addressed by means of some form of modelling scenario.
              | Such economic models have potential strengths and
              | challenges. The greatest potential strength is in fully
              | probabilistic modelling, which may provide appropriate
              | estimates of cost-effectiveness in different circumstances,
              | which may be specified by the modeller. The updated
              | British NICE guide on the methods of technology
              | appraisal also recommended this approach (Claxton et
              | al. 2005). The greatest challenge is to avoid the situation
              | where the design and population of economic models is
              | undertaken with a particular aim and without objective use
              | of available data.
              | The importance of country-specific evaluations of
              | effectiveness and, in particular, of economic data (e.g.
              | costs and cost-effectiveness) is something that needs to
              | be considered even in the earliest phases of study
              | development. Indeed, the timely documentation of
              | potential country-specific differences can simplify the
              | later analysis and interpretation of study findings.
              | Nevertheless, it would seem highly desirable to place
              | the available methods within a firm and binding framework—
              | for example by establishing binding national and international
              | guidelines.
              | Conclusion
              | The technical problems surrounding the health economic
              | assessments and adaptations based on multinational
              | studies are well known and generally accepted. From
              | the perspective of national decision makers, there is
              | nevertheless a great need to adapt the findings of these
              | studies to the local setting, especially in light of their
              | economic impact. There are a variety of methods for
              | identifying and adjusting country-specific differences in
              | costs, effects and cost-effectiveness. As a result, multi-
              | national studies will continue to play a crucial role in the
              | evaluation of cost-effectiveness at the national level. It
              | seems likely that the growing interest in multinational
              | studies will lead to continued developments in adaptation
              | methods, thus helping to ensure the consistency and
              | transferability of study findings between various settings.
