              | The knowledge of nursing, in part, corresponds to a set of theories that support professional
              | practice and reveals the action of care, developed in response to a need of the human being and the
              | community. This practice of nursing can be seen as a social being exercised by professionals on the
              | object of your doing, by who establish relationships, applying their knowledge as a way to transform a
              | concrete reality.1
              | From this perspective, theories are built from concepts, models, propositions serve as a
              | basis to support practical actions, assisting and explaining the approaches taken by the work object -
              | the human being. In nursing, the body of the human being, the person suffering physical,
              | psychological, social and spiritual, can be understood as the object in which it performs the task of
              | professional nursing. This task it is the therapeutic care, which is set in action, which develops and
              | completes with the human being, value-laden ethical and a necessary good people.2
              | To understand the formation of theoretical nursing, it briefly redeems some historical events
              | of the constitution of the profession. The nursing for many years, described its procedures, from
              | clinical practice to the first decades of the twentieth century, systematize them as first organized
              | form of knowledge, subsequently, by the institution of the scientific principles that underlie. And
              | more recently, in the 1950s and 1960s, the concern focused on reflecting more deeply about the
              | profession, its object of study and the theoretical framework relevant to care, when then began to
              | be built nursing theories.3
              | Theories hold a reciprocal relationship with the nursing actions and jointly exercising daily
              | work is the therapeutic care, as epistemological object, which refers to the discipline of nursing, to
              | structuring their professional practice.4
              | However, it's still observed in the literature scarcity of scientific theories about the national
              | nursing. A study on the subject points out that only 4.6% of the publications used nursing theories of
              | 3757 articles, seven nursing journals, from 1998 to 2007.5
              | The proposed consideration of theories focuses on nursing recognizing it as a discipline,
              | profession and social practice, through the formalization of concepts and theories, as the proper
              | instruments to direct the search for specificity of nursing, ie, limits of performance relative to other
              | professionals, own body of knowledge, autonomy, professional identity and visibility.6
              | In this direction, the Theory of Professional Links (DVT) consists of a tool for nursing, which
              | aims to train, and continuously affirming interpersonal relationships in nursing team, as a unit group,
              | in addition to the group of persons with potential for growth and strengthening the practices of care,
              | through the establishment of healthy professional bonds. This theory, in essence, seeks to address
              | the interpersonal relationships between nurses and staff, thereby establishing therapeutic
              | relationships more. Moreover, grasps the links with the development of group dynamics arising from
              | movements that take place in two spheres of relationships, institutional space and space-specific
              | care action, directing the action team to the exercise of therapeutic care.7
              | Based on these, this paper it is a critical reflection about the importance of nursing theories,
              | using DVT, as an example, to assert theories as instruments of labor, which formalize the actions of
              | the nursing profession and, as a social practice, which builds daily.

              | Epistemological context of nursing
              | The construction of knowledge in nursing is still in its initial phase; however, the designation
              | of care is based on the principle of a practice that develops on the nurse-client interaction, with the
              | intention of contributing to the welfare this in their daily lives. The watch is designed by many
              | scholars as an epistemological object of nursing because it involves humans in its complexity, which is
              | the focus of their work.4
              | Progress can also be seen in the evolution of conceptions of the term "human being" and the
              | paradigm shift in the management and attention paid to the needs of health. In the twentieth century,
              | there was the assertion of the fragmentation of the human body and mind, from the biomedical model
              | that produces the mechanism of making the individual's biological vision, expertise about the person's
              | body, the appreciation of the technical procedures of the act physician and the emphasis on curative
              | medicine, which reinforce the division of the person into parts, making the union of these fragments,
              | for an overview of the human being, especially considering besides the organic aspects, such as illness,
              | other dimensions of human life- psychological, social, spiritual, economic, among others.
              | Moreover, the biopsychosocial model of health care and management emerged as a way to
              | meet the shortcomings of the model history, such as the production of health in people with chronic
              | diseases, autoimmune cases without clinical diagnoses or difficult to solve . Still, compared to recent
              | paradigm that other knowledge professionals now become necessary to complexity involving health
              | care to people.9
              | Nowadays, much of the demand for health services, in terms of workforce - professionals, is
              | related to knowledge that go beyond the biomedical model approach, demanding greater coverage of
              | the process of health and disease, with emphasis on policies health and operation of new modes of
              | care. This question is linked to the fact that in recent decades there have been changes in clinical and
              | epidemiological profile of the population, life expectancy, the economy and world politics, with
              | consequent restructuring of the health sector and pose new challenges to the professionals, who must
              | so articulate, organize to confront the problems that arise in different scenarios and actions that
              | impact the health field and do nursing.10
              | In this context, although the nursing care adopt as its object of activity, the profession still
              | suffers the effects of the need to occupy positions of power and develop nurses as being socio-
              | político.6 Moreover, this area deals with health permanent identity crisis, the lack of an
              | epistemological and theoretical dependence of scientific practices in the field of health and other
              | areas.
              | Thus, the question is: why not think about the epistemological object as therapeutic care
              | nursing? Dare to conceive this as metaparadigm this field of knowledge and at the same time, nursing
              | grounded in epistemic structure multiparadigmatic, before the lack of professional identity and in
              | accordance with the needs of customer care.
              | From this perspective, it is clear that the Brazilian nursing theories are still incomplete, often
              | being disregarded and devalued in academic and professional spaces.
              | These gaps reflect the corpus of nursing, in particular, within the pedagogical and healthcare,
              | as these are an aspect conditional better understood in relation to theories and practices that once

              | imported, without being questioned, they became the majority, or hegemonic because measures were
              | taken as saviors of professional difficulties, accumulated from historical experiences of thinking and
              | action in nursing. In terms of scientific construction, there is a nursing losses undesirable lack of
              | power, as knowledge areas face the pressures of health policies by regulators or the funding agencies
              | and research support.12
              | In recent decades, the paradigm shifts in the field of health care and management are
              | occurring rapidly, since the construction of the social process, which has the most wins the right to
              | health of millions of Brazilians, from a philosophical and conceptual basis derived in Sanitary Reform
              | movement, whose landmark the XVIII National Health Conference, held in 1986, which instituted its
              | eminently interdisciplinary due to multiple measurements and historical mediations. Thus, those who
              | have concrete object as work health and disease in its social context cannot from a single discipline to
              | guide their professional actions, because it involves both social relationships and social itself, the
              | expressions emotional, as well as the biological conditions and reasons socio-cultural and historical
              | individuals and groups.
              | Similarly, in the educational field, the new National Curriculum Guidelines provide an
              | important achievement in the field of nursing by pointing, as policy, the need to produce changes in
              | the training process, providing professionals more committed and engaged with the principles and
              | guidelines of the Unified Health System (SUS). These efforts correspond to the concern of breaking
              | definitively with the biological paradigm and medicalized, hospital-and procedure-centered, meeting
              | the new challenges of contemporary knowledge production, the production of professions and
              | establishing healthy relationships in work teams.
              | The link between education, work and social practices envisions a new perspective on
              | significant transformation in the daily life of each professional involved with comprehensive care,
              | especially when organized from the health needs of the population. So this is where nursing, as well as
              | other health professions, needs greater engagement in defense of an argument more solid permeated
              | by assumptions Health Reform with a view to reviewing, in which lie the paradigm of current models
              | health care and what has been their role in this process, action that dispenses with the reorientation
              | of their professional practice.13
              | From this point of view, it should be noted that health work is highly relational, since its focus
              | is human care cannot, as in other production models are cast in equipment or highly structured
              | knowledge, such as organizational technologies However, the meeting of subjectivities, incorporating a
              | significant degree of freedom in choosing the method of doing this production.14
              | In this space often inconspicuous amid the daily routine of many health workers and the
              | discussion of the performance of an interdisciplinary manner, which focuses the importance of theories
              | in the construction of specific core of knowledge, social practice and consolidation limits nursing
              | activities, by their epistemological possibility in therapeutic care and ethics in dealing with

              | Thus, the scope of the potential of teamwork may be valued at the time at which individuals
              | recognize themselves as members of a group with a common goal. Thus, team members may feel
              | responsible, both for its failures as its successes, participating in decision making and particularly
              | describing the communication of essential information to nursing work.
              | Team work can be understood as "a network of relationships between people, power,
              | knowledge, emotions, desires and interests, it is possible to identify group processes, where teamwork
              | equals to relate."15:264
              | Accordingly, DVT aims to provide nurses a model of teamwork in nursing, which promotes
              | interpersonal relationships, ie professional ties to the scope object epistemological nursing - care
              | therapeutic, committed people who need care health services. Furthermore, it allows the
              | establishment of greater inclusion and significance of the group in the institution, and also reinforces
              | the very identity of the nurse as leader, ie, team coordinator and the planning of their activities.
              | The basic assumptions of this theory are based on a philosophical look at historical and
              | dialectical materialism, in which the bonds have a professional nature expressed in action and speech.
              | That is, the bonds between humans are determined by the totality of the person through their
              | relationship internal and external reflected through their actions and their words, not a part of it,
              | because the worker must not separate his inner life of its externality, since the extent that the bonds
              | formed professional group acquires a personality, an identity, determining your viewing and valuing
              | the institution.
              | In addressing the relational skills of the management process in nursing, DVT has several sets
              | of concepts, especially with regard to the subject of the theory, the nurse and the tool mediates
              | between the nurses and the other staff members, technicians and assistants nursing and community
              | health workers, ie, the model for teamwork in nursing. The goal of this proposal is focused on the
              | relational and managerial actions of the nurse as a mediator in the process of establishment of
              | Professional Links.
              | The theory of knowledge is a process, because it includes the process of working in nursing
              | and nurse-staff interaction in group dynamics. It is a suggestion with a high level of adaptation to the
              | reality of the group, but is constructed by the operational method, and presents strategies for
              | implementation of the theory in a clear and practical, requiring the trader is scientific knowledge,
              | sensitivity, creativity, imagination and skills to execute them.

              | This reflection-critique that focused on the importance of nursing theories to strengthen the
              | profession of nursing and social practice to inter-relate the context of nursing knowledge, DVT stands
              | as a model to be experienced in daily care in order to qualify the relationship at work. It is, however,
