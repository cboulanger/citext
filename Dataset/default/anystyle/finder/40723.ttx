              | Institutions for Long-Lasting Peace
              | Julia Strasheim
              | After the uprising against President Yanukovych, Ukraine’s opposition convened an in-
              | terim government to pave the way for elections in May 2014. This year also saw inter-
              | im governments put in place in the Central African Republic and Thailand. Meanwhile,
              | peace talks in South Sudan came to a standstill in October 2014 because parties were un-
              | able to agree on the role of the prime minister in an interim government.
              | Analysis
              | Interim governments are often installed during peace processes, and policy makers
              | tend to portray them as magic bullets that are capable of resolving all forms of violent
              | conflict and promoting postconflict democracy. Their record, however, is mixed. This
              | is partly because policy makers focus on distributing interim government seats among
              | conflict parties. It is just as vital, though, to ensure that interim governments implement
              | crucial reforms and integrate civil society in decision-making processes.
              |  Postconflict interim governments are set up to organize elections, conduct institu-
              | tional reforms, and facilitate conflict resolution. They are particularly common in
              | sub-Saharan Africa, where they have been installed after over 60 percent of armed
              | conflicts.
              |  The record shows that power-sharing interim governments, such as in Liberia, and
              | international interim governments, such as in Kosovo, are most successful in ad-
              | vancing peace and democracy.
              | 
              | 
              | Among the most vital reforms interim governments need to implement is the inte-
              | gration of the parallel institutions that warring parties maintain during armed con-
              | lfict. As long as parties retain control over military structures or shadow adminis-
              | trations, they will possess the resources to return to fighting.
              | How interim governments are perceived by the broader public is also important. In-
              | cluding civil society in decision making, such as when drafting a new electoral law,
              | increases the acceptance of reforms.

              | Interim Governments as Tools for Conflict
              | Resolution
              | When promoting peace and democratization in
              | societies marked by internal violence, the inter-
              | national community often calls for the installation
              | of interim governments. Interim governments are
              | institutions set in place to facilitate the transition
              | from an old regime to a new one, organize dem-
              | ocratic elections, provide venues for conflict res-
              | olution for the warring parties, and implement
              | crucial institutional reforms early on in the peace
              | process. They often convene after warring parties
              | have signed a peace agreement, but they can al-
              | so form while fighting is still taking place. Interim
              | governments typically cease to function with the
              | holding of elections so that a new, “permanent”
              | government can take over. Figure 1 shows that in-
              | terim governments were common in postconflict
              | peace processes all over the world between 1989
              | and 2012. This has been particularly evident in
              | sub-Saharan Africa, where interim governments
              | were installed following over 60 percent of armed
              | conflicts, including civil wars in Burundi, Libe-
              | ria, and the Central African Republic (CAR). In-
              | terim governments were also set up after roughly
              | 50 percent of armed conflicts in Europe, the Mid-
              | dle East, South America and Central America as
              | well as after about 25 percent of armed conflicts
              | in Asia.
              | Policy makers, warring parties, and the me-
              | dia have thus recently started to increasingly por-
              | tray interim governments as “magic bullets” ca-
              | pable of resolving all forms of violent conflict. For
              | instance, in June 2012 the then US Secretary of
              | State, Hillary Clinton, stressed the need to create
              | “a fully representative and inclusive interim gov-
              | ernment which leads to free and fair elections” in
              | Syria (The Telegraph 2012). In the final years of Sri
              | Lanka’s civil war that ended in 2009, the Libera-
              | tion Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) demanded the
              | creation of an internationally backed interim self-
              | governing authority, but the government denied
              | them such a request. And recently commenting on
              | Afghanistan’s current struggle for peace, Foreign
              | Policy identified a new interim government even
              | as “the only choice left” (Koskinas 2014) for the
              | country. Such a cure-all view on interim govern-
              | ments is, however, somewhat paradoxical. While
              | they may help to resolve conflict in some cases,
              | they also raise questions regarding the democratic
              | legitimacy of and impunity for actors involved in
              | the conduct of war:
              | • First, interim governments are typically un-
              | elected and thus democratically illegitimate in-
              | stitutions that are put in place to promote de-
              | mocracy, a system that thrives on elections to
              | determine its political leaders. Interim govern-
              | ments have hence also been called “benevolent
              | autocrats” (Chesterman 2004).

              | • Second, interim governments are also regularly
              | perceived as bridges to peace and conflict reso-
              | lution, but they are usually dominated by those
              | actors that started the war in the first place. It
              | is not rare for the warring parties’ leaders, who
              | are often inexperienced in governing a state, to
              | exploit their positions in interim governments
              | to enrich themselves, instead of generating col-
              | lective goods for the benefit of all members of
              | society.
              | Despite these paradoxes, interim governments
              | were also frequently put in place in 2014. In
              | Ukraine the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych’s
              | regime in February after prolonged protests in
              | Kiev’s Independence Square brought an interim
              | government to power that was ruled by the for-
              | mer opposition parties. Despite being in place
              | until Petro Poroshenko was elected president in
              | May 2014, the interim government did not resolve
              | Ukraine’s lingering political conflict. In March
              | 2014, after an internationally unrecognized in-
              | dependence referendum and a Russian interven-
              | tion, Russia recognized the Crimean Peninsula as
              | a sovereign state. Shortly thereafter, violence esca-
              | lated into a civil war in Ukraine’s eastern oblasts.
              | In the Central African Republic (CAR) a nation-
              | al transitional council was installed in January
              | 2014 after a prolonged armed conflict between the
              | Séléka coalition and supporters of former presi-
              | dent Francois Bozizé. Catherine Samba-Panza, the
              | mayor of the capital Bangui, became interim pres-
              | ident. These political changes did not, however,
              | resolve the country’s conflict, and United Nations
              | (UN) troops were required to take over the peace-
              | keeping mission in September 2014 in an atempt
              | to stop the continued bloodshed. In South Sudan
              | the May 2014 peace accord called for the creation
              | of an interim government. But peace talks were
              | at a standstill as of October 2014 because warring
              | party leaders have been unable to agree on inter-
              | im cabinet positions. And in Thailand the army
              | set up a military interim government after over-
              | throwing Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s
              | regime in May 2014. Military rulers have prom-
              | ised political reforms and democratic elections,
              | though they are yet to materialize.
              | The record for all of these 2014 interim govern-
              | ments in promoting sustainable peace and democ-
              | racy is thus mixed at best. When are interim gov-
              | ernments instruments for peace and democracy?
              | And when do they fail to keep their promises?
              | The Institutional Design of Interim
              | Governments
              | Thus far, political science has almost exclusively
              | analyzed the institutional designs of interim gov-
              | ernments by assessing how these bodies add to
              | postconflict peace and democracy. This is based
              | on an influential typology that identifies which
              | political elite actors dominate interim govern-
              | ments and diferentiates between four institution-
              | al designs: caretaker, revolutionary, power-shar-
              | ing and international.
              | Caretaker interim governments are ruled by the
              | incumbent regime’s authoritarian elites. This was
              | the case in Angola, for instance, where the incum-
              | bent People’s Movement for the Liberation of An-
              | gola (MPLA) were in power during the transition-
              | al period between the signing of the Bicesse Peace
              | Agreement in 1991 and presidential elections in
              | 1992. The rebels of the National Union for the To-
              | tal Independence of Angola (UNITA) were not in-
              | cluded.
              | If a regime is defeated by an opposition par-
              | ty, however, the later may install a revolutionary
              | interim government – as occurred in Libya in 2011.
              | There Muammar Gaddafi’s regime was over-
              | thrown by the rebel-ruled National Transitional
              | Council (NTC), which organized elections for the
              | General National Congress in July 2012.
              | In a power-sharing interim government, incum-
              | bent and new elites join forces, as was the case af-
              | ter Liberia’s long-lasting civil war in 2003. And in
              | an international interim government, international
              | actors (commonly through the lead of the UN) as-
              | sume political authority for a period of time – an
              | example of which is the establishment of the UN
              | Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo at the
              | turn of the millennium (Shain and Linz 1995).
              | The record shows that power-sharing and in-
              | ternational forms of interim governments (such
              | as those in Liberia and Kosovo, respectively) are
              | more successful in promoting postconflict peace
              | and democratization than are caretaker and rev-
              | olutionary designs (like those set up in Ango-
              | la and Libya, respectively), which exclude one of
              | the warring factions. This is because, among oth-
              | er things, interim power sharing ofers all relevant
              | warring party leaders a position in political ofice
              | and thus assures them that they will not be dom-
              | inated or marginalized in the peace process. Fur-
              | thermore, a seat in an interim cabinet or parlia-
              | ment is at times viewed to be more lucrative than

              | is continuing to fight for political power on the
              | batlefield. For instance, Foday Sankoh, leader of
              | Sierra Leone’s Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
              | rebel movement, is said to have signed the 1999
              | Lomé Peace Agreement in exchange for the vice
              | presidency and control over the national diamond
              | trade (Binningsbø and Dupuy 2009). Interim rule
              | in Sierra Leone ended with elections in May 2002,
              | and civil war has not recurred. In Angola, on the
              | other hand, UNITA received no seats in the care-
              | taker interim government and thus had no reason
              | to believe that the government could deliver free
              | and fair elections. After UNITA’s Jonas Savimbi
              | lost to José Eduardo dos Santos of the MPLA in
              | the 1992 presidential elections, the rebels remobi-
              | lized for civil war.
              | While power-sharing interim governments can
              | thus often lure warring factions into peace by of-
              | fering certain benefits, international interim gov-
              | ernments come instead with capacity or coer-
              | cion. Due to their greater technical knowledge as
              | well as financial and human resources, UN inter-
              | im governments (“transitional administrations”)
              | are, in theory, often beter equipped than internal-
              | ly conflictual power-sharing interim governments
              | to rebuild state institutions. International interim
              | governments also often possess suficient military
              | manpower via peacekeeping missions to ensure
              | warring parties comply. For example, internation-
              | al authority has prevented the recurrence of civil
              | war in Bosnia, where the Ofice of the High Rep-
              | resentative is allowed to dismiss domestic leaders
              | from political ofice if they are seen to be pursuing
              | an ethnonationalist agenda.
              | The Bosnian case, however, points to prob-
              | lematic aspects of international interim rule that
              | are often dismissed as illegitimate, undemocratic
              | or neocolonial forms of postconflict governance.
              | Furthermore, UN administrations typically sufer
              | from operational deficiencies such as being very
              | slow to deploy and lacking the necessary cultural
              | and/or linguistic skills to rule a foreign territory.
              | Also, international interim governments are often
              | criticized for imposing Western ideas of democ-
              | racy in postconflict societies in the Global South
              | – particularly in cases where reforms are imple-
              | mented with low levels of local ownership over
              | the process. For instance, the UN administration
              | established in East Timor in 1999 did not initial-
              | ly intend assign any executive or legislative pow-
              | er to the East Timorese political elites. Only in Au-
              | gust 2000, after political elites protested against
              | the lack of influence they had over East Timor’s
              | transition to independence, did the UN create the
              | East Timor Transitional Administration (ETTA)
              | – a body that represented the structure of East
              | Timor’s government following the cessation of the
              | interim government.
              | These issues already point to the many chal-
              | lenges faced by international interim govern-
              | ments. But power-sharing interim governments
              | also have to deal with dificulties. In fact, many
              | power-sharing interim regimes installed between
              | 1989 and 2012 failed to deliver sustainable peace
              | and democratization (e.g., the Democratic Repub-
              | lic of the Congo [DRC] and Burundi). Although
              | there are many reasons for this, one explanation
              | suggests that power-sharing interim governments
              | are seen to reward the use of violence with a seat
              | in political ofice, which then motivates formerly
              | unarmed groups to take up arms in order to al-
              | so receive a seat in interim government (Tull and
              | Mehler 2005).
              | Another problem with focusing on power shar-
              | ing and internationalization as the key reasons for
              | interim governments’ success or failure is that
              | while these factors may be strong explanations of
              | short-term peace, they often cannot explain long-
              | term, sustainable peace or postconflict democra-
              | tization. For instance, if power-sharing interim
              | governments contribute to peace by ofering war-
              | ring parties interim cabinet seats, what happens
              | once elections take place and a new, postinterim
              | government takes over? It is likely that the for-
              | mer interim governors will refuse to accept being
              | stripped of political power and relegated to the
              | opposition, thus threatening to return to war. This
              | was, in fact, what occurred in Cambodia follow-
              | ing the defeat of Hun Sen, the leader of the Cam-
              | bodian People’s Party (CPP), by Prince Norodom
              | Ranariddh in the 1993 elections. After two years as

              | Institutional Reforms in Interim Governments
              | Because of the aforementioned issues, it would be
              | fruitful to take into account explanations of the
              | success or failure of interim governments that go
              | beyond the presence of power sharing or interna-
              | tional actors. Just as important as the “static” in-
              | stitutional design of interim governments are the
              | “dynamic” features of these governments (i.e., the
              | type of reforms that they conduct). The Cambo-
              | dia example shows how crucially important it is
              | to address early on in a peace process the paral-
              | lel political and military institutions that warring
              | parties create or maintain during armed conflict.
              | In fact, in most armed conflicts today warring fac-
              | tions establish more or less institutionalized and
              | militarized “shadow governments” in order to ac-
              | cumulate the resources needed to engage in war.
              | Together with nonstatutory rebel armies, these
              | parallel structures do not automatically disap-
              | pear just because, for instance, a peace agreement
              | is signed and an interim government is installed.
              | Even in cases like Kosovo, where the mass exodus
              | of Serbian bureaucratic personnel led to an insti-
              | tutional vacuum in the formal state structures af-
              | ter the end of the war, informal Albanian-run par-
              | allel institutions had long been in place – name-
              | ly, a shadow government run (for over a decade)
              | by the unarmed opposition party, the Democrat-
              | ic League of Kosovo, and a self-proclaimed inter-
              | im government run by the Kosovo Liberation Ar-
              | my (and set up before the UN installed its own in-
              | terim administration in June 1999).
              | Thus during a peace period, interim govern-
              | ments must promptly look to integrate the parallel
              | political and military institutions of warring par-
              | ties. These institutions enable such factions to re-
              | main organized and tax a population, which pro-
              | vides them with finances to purchase weapons in
              | the event they lose elections and decide to prevent
              | their political elimination by force. In the above-
              | mentioned case of Angola, for instance, UNITA
              | never allowed the MPLA caretaker interim gov-
              | ernment access to its districts, therefore prevent-
              | ing electoral registration being carried out in these
              | areas. Wherever the interim government tried to
              | expand its territorial outreach in UNITA strong-
              | holds, UNITA rebels atacked and/or kidnapped
              | government oficials, thus forcing them to cancel
              | their electoral registration eforts. When UNITA’s
              | Savimbi lost the 1992 elections to the MPLA’s de
              | Santos, he was able to quickly regroup his party
              | – primarily in the communes and municipalities
              | that UNITA had never handed over to the interim
              | government. Similarly, in Cambodia the 1991 Par-
              | is Peace Agreement did not require a strong com-
              | mitment by the warring parties to disband their
              | military structures, but rather only that the fac-
              | tions agreed to disarm and demobilize before or
              | shortly after the elections and to abide by the de-
              | cisions of the subsequently elected government.
              | But these terms were never strongly enforced, and
              | the disarmament process was never completed.
              | Consequently, not only was Hun Sen able to force
              | his way into power despite losing the 1993 elec-
              | tion, but Khmer Rouge rebels were able to contin-
              | ue their struggle against Hun Sen’s government
              | until 1998.
              | In contrast, the reforms implemented in Nepal
              | demonstrate how an interim government’s mo-
              | nopolization of power can increase its impact on
              | postconflict peace. During Nepal’s ten-year-long
              | civil war, the Maoist rebels controlled up to 75
              | percent of the national territory. They used their
              | strongholds to set up people’s courts and peo-
              | ple’s governments, to extract taxes from the ru-
              | ral population, and to force villagers to provide
              | insurgents with food and accommodation. When
              | the Maoists signed Nepal’s Comprehensive Peace
              | Agreement in November 2006, they agreed to dis-
              | band their parallel structures upon joining the in-
              | terim institutions. The new inclusive interim par-
              | liament convened in January 2007, and a complete
              | dissolution of the people’s courts and govern-
              | ments was reported for February the same year.
              | Although the subsequent peace process in Nepal
              | had and still has to overcome many obstacles (e.g.,
              | a thorough reform of the country’s security sec-
              | tor is necessary), the country has thus far not re-
              | turned to civil war.
              | Elite Afairs and More Inclusive Processes
              | The role of interim governments is not solely to
              | afect the behavior and perceptions of the leaders
              | of warring parties. Equally important is how they
              | engage the broader public, especially civil society
              | organizations, in postconflict societies. The inclu-
              | sion of the public in processes of institutional re-
              | form (e.g., amending the constitution or drafting
              | new electoral laws) can widen the acceptance of
              | such reforms and increase their sustainability and
              | legitimacy. For those people or groups that have
              | GIGA Focus International Edition/English 9/2014
              | - 5 -
              | been excluded from a reform process conducted
              | by an elite few or marginalized by the decisions
              | of interim leaders, violent revolt may become a le-
              | gitimate strategy to stop or reverse such process-
              | es and decisions. Therefore, interim governments
              | that consult with civil society during reform pro-
              | cesses are likely to be more successful in contrib-
              | uting to sustainable peace and durable democrati-
              | zation than are interim governments that are mere
              | elite afairs.
              | We can see this, for example, in Afghanistan af-
              | ter the US-led international intervention in 2001.
              | The Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) was put in
              | place by the December 2001 Bonn Agreement.
              | The AIA, under the guidance of President Hamid
              | Karzai, was charged with drafting the country’s
              | new post-Taliban constitution and electoral law.
              | But although the institutions of the AIA included
              | a broad spectrum of Afghanistan’s ethnic and so-
              | cial groups, the lawmaking process was essential-
              | ly closed to broader and inclusive public debate.
              | The AIA presented the electoral law to the popu-
              | lation largely as a done deal and was consequent-
              | ly perceived as mostly serving the interests of the
              | interim power brokers. On the contrary, the 2003–
              | 2005 National Transitional Government in Liberia
              | allocated posts not only to the former ruling Na-
              | tional Patriotic Party (NPP) and the rebel groups
              | Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democra-
              | cy (LURD) and Movement for Democracy in Li-
              | beria (MODEL), but also to other political parties
              | and civil society groups. Instead of a rebel lead-
              | er, Gyude Bryant, a civilian and businessman, was
              | named interim president. Even though this consti-
              | tutes a much more comprehensive and seemingly
              | sustainable institutional reform process than that
              | in Afghanistan, it also proved dificult for civil so-
              | ciety members in Liberia to serve both as formal
              | representatives in the interim bodies and to per-
              | form their roles as watchdogs over the political
              | process.
              | Interim Governments and German Foreign
              | Policy
              | What conclusions can be drawn from the above
              | discussion for the interim governments installed
              | (and those yet to be convened) in 2014? And what
              | recommendations can be made for German and
              | international policy makers that are likely to pro-
              | mote interim governments to help resolve future
              | armed conflicts?
              | In Ukraine the outbreak of violence may have
              | been prevented if the interim government had not
              | been presented as a political “clean break” with
              | the former regime. An original plan for the transi-
              | tion of Ukraine proposed by German foreign min-
              | ister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his counter-
              | parts from Poland and France included a power-
              | sharing interim government of national unity that
              | would have been composed of both the opposi-
              | tion and members of Viktor Yanukovych’s regime.
              | Instead, the regime was toppled, and the opposi-
              | tion’s interim government (atempting to reform
              | the civil administration) swiftly dismissed a num-
              | ber of long-seated bureaucrats and tried to impose
              | a bill that aimed to make Ukrainian the sole state
              | language – threatening Russian-speaking Ukrai-
              | nians in the country’s eastern oblasts, which were
              | Yanukovych strongholds. A more inclusive tran-
              | sition process that had beter taken into consid-
              | eration voices from eastern Ukraine would have
              | added to national reconciliation.
              | The above discussion also shows that pow-
              | er sharing alone often cannot explain the success
              | or failure of interim governments. In South Su-
              | dan warring party leaders signed a peace accord
              | in May 2014. These leaders, however, continue to-
              | day to fight over cabinet posts, with each warring
              | faction stressing its right to lead the interim gov-
              | ernment. Similarly, the change in the CAR’s staf-
              | ing policy that came with Catherine Samba-Pan-
              | za’s appointment as interim president in January
              | 2014 did not change the situation on the ground:
              | violence remains a daily threat in the country.
              | Equally important to the question of who runs the
              | interim government is what reforms the interim
              | government implements. Both Salva Kiir, current
              | president of South Sudan, and Catherine Sam-
              | ba-Panza addressed the UN General Assembly
              | in September 2014 to appeal to the member states
              | to strengthen the UN peacekeeping operations in
              | their respective countries – in part because inter-
              | im governments require substantial internation-
              | al support to disarm and demobilize combatants.
              | In the CAR the interim government is becoming
              | meaningless outside the capital Bangui. It has no
              | control of the country’s North, where former pres-
              | ident Michel Am-Nondokro Djotodia has formed
              | a parallel government in the city of Birao. The ex-
              | perience of Angola (as discussed above) rendered
              | a reform process unlikely and impeded the hold-
              | GIGA Focus International Edition/English 9/2014
              | - 6 -
              | ing of elections (as currently planned) in Febru-
              | ary 2015, not least because electoral registration
              | requires control over the national territory.
              | Lastly, in Thailand the interim National Coun-
              | cil for Peace and Order (NCPO) of Prime Minister
              | Prayuth Chan-ocha, and then head of the army,
              | was criticized in September 2014 in an Amnesty
              | International report that accused it of systematic
              | human rights violations. The allegations include
              | arbitrary arrests and the restriction of freedom of
              | expression and assembly. Amnesty Internation-
              | al claims that such restrictions are unfavorable to
              | an inclusive institutional reform process as well as
              | national reconciliation. The situation in Thailand
              | is that without consulting civil society in the insti-
              | tutional reform process, Thailand’s interim lead-
              | ers are risking a hard landing: not only will re-
              | forms not supported by civil society be unsustain-
              | able, but an exclusive interim period might pro-
              | mote further unrest in the country.
              | In general, international actors engaged in
              | postconflict democracy promotion and peace-
              | building have in the past often paid much aten-
              | tion to distributing seats in the interim govern-
              | ment among political leaders. This is, however, of-
              | ten not enough to ensure that an interim govern-
              | ment succeeds in securing long-term peace and
              | sustainable democracy. German and internation-
              | al policy makers should therefore strive to equip
              | interim governments with the capacity to com-
              | plete much-needed reforms before elections take
              | place – for instance, by supporting UN peacekeep-
              | ing missions that can help to disarm and demobi-
              | lize rebel groups. Furthermore, civil society actors
              | and unarmed opposition parties should be given
              | stronger roles in interim governments. The exam-
              | ple of Liberia, however, where such actors have
              | even been rewarded with seats in the interim par-
              | liament, shows that such inclusion may not al-
              | ways be the best approach. Instead, policy mak-
              | ers could encourage interim governments to allow
              | for public debates and implement transparent re-
              | form processes by, for example, holding referenda
              | on newly drafted constitutions.
