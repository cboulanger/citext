              | Abstract: In this article we present estimates of the tempo-adjusted total fertility
              | rate in Western and Eastern Germany from 1955 to 2008. Tempo adjustment of the
              | total fertility rate (TFR) requires data on the annual number of births by parity and
              | age of the mother. Since ofﬁcial statistics do not provide such data for West Ger-
              | many as well as Eastern Germany from 1990 on we used alternative data sources
              | which include these speciﬁc characteristics. The combined picture of conventional
              | TFR and tempo-adjusted TFR* provides interesting information about the trends
              | in period fertility in Western and Eastern Germany, above all with regard to the
              | differences between the two regions and the enormous extent of tempo effects in
              | Eastern Germany during the 1990s. Compared to corresponding data for popula-
              | tions from other countries, our estimates of the tempo-adjusted TFR* for Eastern
              | and Western Germany show plausible trends. Nevertheless, it is important to note
              | that the estimates of the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate presented in this paper
              | should not be seen as being on the level of or equivalent to ofﬁcial statistics since
              | they are based on different kinds of data with different degrees of quality.

text          | Introduction
              | The East-West German differences in fertility trends which have been observed
              | over many decades are probably the most frequently studied aspect of the demo-
              | graphic differences between Eastern and Western Germany. Above all the changes
              | in Eastern German fertility have been frequently studied in recent years (e.g. Dorb-
              | ritz 1992; Menning 1995; Witte/Wagner 1995; Conrad et al. 1996; Beck-Gernshe-

              | graphic shock” experienced by the population in the new Federal Länder after the

              | political changes (Eberstadt 1994). The level of fertility and its changes over time
              | are particularly important because they have the strongest long-term impact on the
              | age structure of a population (Luy 2009). This is why the determinants of fertility
              | and of childlessness in the context of the speciﬁc backgrounds of life in Western
              | and Eastern Germany have been analysed intensively in recent years (e.g. Dorbritz/
              | Schwarz 1996; Hank 2002; Dornseiff/Sackmann 2003; Hank/Kreyenfeld 2003; Hank
              | et al. 2004; Butterwege et al. 2005; Eckhard 2006; Boehnke 2007; Bernardi/Keim
              | 2007; Bernardi et al. 2008; Arránz Becker et al. 2010; Pötzsch 2010).
              | For most politically and socially relevant questions the absolute numbers of
              | births are of primary interest since these determine the future numbers of kinder-
              | garten children, school pupils, students, employed persons or pensioners, albeit
              | the size of these population groups is additionally determined by mortality and mi-
              | gration. Demographic fertility research, by contrast, studies primarily the relative
              | fertility quantum in order to be able to describe changes and differences between
              | populations and to identify the corresponding determinants and inﬂuencing factors.
              | The demographic indicator used most frequently in the ﬁeld of period analysis – i.e.
              | the analysis of fertility conditions in a speciﬁc calendar year – is the “total fertility
              | rate” (TFR) which is often interpreted as the “average number of children”. However,
              | it is generally difﬁcult in the period analysis to give a speciﬁc meaning to such meas-
              | ures. This is only possible in the cohort perspective, in which the fertility of a real
              | cohort is analysed year by year on a longitudinal basis. Period analysis, by contrast,
              | summarizes the fertility of a speciﬁc calendar year using the age-speciﬁc fertility
              | rates of all women who were between 15 and 49 years old in this calendar year. By
              | summing up the age-speciﬁc fertility rates to the total fertility rate, a hypothetical
              | cohort is constructed which is supposed to represent the current fertility conditions
              | (see Sobotka and Lutz 2010 on the problem of the use of the period TFR for ques-
              | tions of political and societal relevance).
              | The observed or reconstructed number of births of women belonging to a cer-
              | tain cohort can be inﬂuenced by speciﬁc period and cohort effects. In general, these
              | effects are not seen as distortions, but rather as causal determinants of cohort fer-
              | tility and are thus of central interest of the analysis. Period analysis, by contrast,
              | aims to describe the “pure” fertility level of a speciﬁc calendar year– the so-called
              | “quantum of fertility” – without including any other structural factors determining
              | or inﬂuencing the level of fertility. A classical structural factor inﬂuencing the overall
              | fertility level is the age composition of a population, which can have a major impact
              | on the number of births. Thus, demographic period indicators such as the TFR are
              | calculated as age-standardised measures. (Although cohort indicators are gener-
              | ally calculated age-standardised as well, no comparable distortion effects of the
              | age composition can occur here).
              | At the end of the 1990s, Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) showed that changes in
              | the average age at childbirth occurring during a calendar year alter fertility rates and
              | hence the TFR, a phenomenon that has been described already by Hajnal (1947).
              | Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) referred to this alteration of the TFR as a “tempo ef-
              | fect” and proposed to not only standardize the total fertility rate by age, but to also
              | adjust the TFR for tempo effects. The basic idea of Bongaarts and Feeney is that
              | Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 607
              | tempo effects are also a structural factor distorting the TFR when this indicator
              | is used to reﬂect the pure quantum of current fertility. An increase in the average
              | age at childbirth during the analyzed calendar year leads to a tempo effect-caused
              | reduction in the fertility rates, and a reduction in the average age at childbirth leads
              | to a tempo effect-caused increase in the fertility rates. Even though the existence
              | of such tempo effects in the period TFR is not questioned among demographers,
              | opinions as to the need for the tempo adjustment diverge in some respects. None-
              | theless, the additional use of the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate, which is sym-
              | bolised by TFR*, has more and more become the standard in demographic fertility
              | research in recent years. This can be seen in the increasing number of publications
              | in which fertility trends and differentials are analysed not only on the basis of the
              | conventional TFR, but also using the TFR* (e.g. Lesthaeghe/Willems 1999; Philipov/
              | Kohler 2001; Goldstein et al. 2003; Sobotka 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Frejka/Sobotka
              | 2008; Goldstein et al. 2009). The TFR* is also a part of the standard repertoire of de-
              | mographic indices compiled in the “European Demographic Datasheet”, published
              | every two years by the Vienna Institute of Demography of the Austrian Academy of
              | Sciences (available on the Internet at http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/datasheet/index.
              | html).
              | In most of the above mentioned publications, however, information on the tem-
              | po-adjusted TFR* is missing for some European populations, including Germany.
              | The calculation of the tempo-adjusted TFR* requires the number of births being
              | separated not only by age of the mother but also by parity. This information was
              | not available for uniﬁed Germany and for former West Germany until 2009 because
              | of the statutory regulations. Prior to 2009, the parity was exclusively collected for
              | births of married mothers, with the birth order referring solely to children of the
              | current marriage (including pre-maritial children with the current husband). Pre-
              | maritial children with fathers other than the mother’s current husband, as well as
              | children from previous marriages, have not been considered and thus did not en-
              | ter ofﬁcial population statistics on parity. Only after the supplement of the Popula-
              | tion Statistics Act in 2009 (Bevölkerungsstatistikgesetz/Federal Law Gazette [BGBl]
              | 2007) it was possible to record the so-called “biological birth order” independently
              | of the civil status of the mother for the whole of Germany (see Statistisches Bunde-
              | samt 2010).
              | For the new Federal Länder (eastern Germany), the data of the former GDR are
              | available for the period prior to 1989. These include all births by parity and year of
              | birth of the mother as required for tempo adjustment. After reuniﬁcation, however,
              | the birth statistics were carried out in accordance with the Federal Population Sta-
              | tistics Act, and thus no ofﬁcial data on births by biological parity is available for
              | Eastern Germany for the period from 1989 to 2008.
              | This article aims to provide estimates for the TFR* in Western and Eastern Ger-
              | many from the mid-1950s to the present, and hence to close – at least partly – one
              | of the gaps in international fertility research. In order to separate births by parity
              | as required for tempo adjustment of the TFR, we have used a variety of alternative
              | sources for West Germany as well as for Eastern Germany from 1990 on. These con-

              | for different periods, but they are based in some cases on very small population
              | samples with questionable representativity for the overall population. Moreover, in
              | view of the educational and family bias usually found in survey data, it cannot be
              | ruled out that some of these data sources lead to systematic distortions in estimat-
              | ing parity and age at childbirth. Another inaccuracy results from the fact that the
              | data covers different age ranges of the reproductive life span. Although the tempo-
              | adjusted fertility rates derived from these data are rather plausible when compared
              | to corresponding estimates for other countries with better data bases, it is impor-
              | tant to note that the estimates presented in this paper should not be seen as being
              | on the level of or equivalent to ofﬁcial statistics since they are based on different
              | kinds of data with different degrees of quality.
              | The methods, and above all the data, on which our estimates of the TFR* for
              | Germany are based are described in detail in the next section. Then we present the
              | results for Western and Eastern Germany both in an intra-German as well as in an
              | international comparison. Finally, we summarise the most important ﬁndings and
              | discuss brieﬂy interpretation-related and methodical aspects of the tempo-adjusted
              | total fertility rate. Note that the latter issue as well as a detailed analysis of the fer-
              | tility trends in Western and Eastern Germany are not the central purpose of this
              | paper. Nonetheless, the advantages and disadvantages of the tempo-adjusted TFR*
              | should be at least brieﬂy summarised for those who have not followed the very de-
              | tailed discussion on tempo adjustment or those who have not studied it in detail.

text          | Data and methods
              | The conventional total fertility rate (TFR), which is published by the German Federal
              | Statistical Ofﬁce on an annual basis, is calculated from the sum of the age-speciﬁc
              | fertility rates f(x), which are calculated by dividing the number of all births of women
              | aged x, B(x), by the number of women aged x, P(x):

              | (1)
              | Since all indicators in this article refer to periods, we refrain from using an ad-
              | ditional index for the calendar year as far as possible for reasons of simpliﬁcation.
              | The parameters α and ß represent the lowest and highest ages of women’s repro-
              | ductive life span, which are usually deﬁned as 15 and 49 years. When totalling the
              | age-speciﬁc fertility rates, they all take on the same weight in the resulting TFR, so
              | that – as has already been mentioned in the introduction – the TFR primarily consti-
              | tutes an age-standardised fertility indicator.
              | The basic idea behind tempo adjustment of the TFR is not only to standardize for
              | age but also for shifting effects which emerge in a calendar year when the average
              | age of women at childbirth changes during that calendar year (see Bongaarts/Feeney
              | 1998, 2006, 2010). The direction of these changes can differ between parities. Since
              | Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 609
              | the parities take on different weights in the overall TFR, the tempo adjustment of
              | the TFR according to the method of Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) is performed on
              | a parity-speciﬁc basis. This requires separating the TFR in its parity-speciﬁc com-
              | ponents. The TFR for a parity i is calculated by summing up the corresponding age-
              | and parity-speciﬁc fertility rates f(x)i which differ from the age-speciﬁc fertility rates
              | in equation (1) in that the numerator does not contain all births of women aged x,
              | but only births of parity i, B(x)i:
              | Note that these age- and parity-speciﬁc fertility rates f(x)i are no probabilities
              | (or any related measure) of the transition of a parity i to the next parity i+1. For this
              | purpose, the denominator of the rates should not include all x-year-old women,
              | but only those who actually belong to the female population at risk of giving birth
              | to a child of the i-th birth order (e.g. childless women in the calculation for parity
              | 1). The age- and parity-speciﬁc fertility ﬁgures from equation (2) rather represent
              | the elements of a purely formal parity-speciﬁc decomposition of the TFR as can be
              | demonstrated easily. Subdividing the age-speciﬁc numbers of births B(x) in equa-
              | tion (1) into the parities B(x)1 (ﬁrst births), B(x)2 (second births), B(x)3 (third births)

              | Tempo adjustment of the total fertility rate requires the number of births to be
              | subdivided by the age of the mothers on a parity-speciﬁc basis. The ofﬁcial statis-
              | tics of the GDR (East Germany) recorded all births by parity and year of birth of the
              | mother, and thus the tempo-adjusted TFR* for East Germany for the period 1955 to
              | 1987 can be directly estimated from these data. For the new Federal Länder since
              | uniﬁcation in 1990 (Eastern Germany) as well as for the territory of the former Fed-
              | eral Republic of Germany (West respective Western Germany), ofﬁcial data on the
              | biological birth order are only available since 2009. In order to carry out the parity-
              | speciﬁc subdivision of the birth numbers necessary for the tempo adjustment of
              | the TFR for West respective Western Germany and Eastern Germany from 1990
              | onwards, it was necessary to use alternative data sources:
              | • Birg et al. (1990) provided an estimate of the parity-speciﬁc subdivision of
              | births in the Federal Republic of Germany for the years 1958 to 1985. The
              | estimates were based on the family biographies collected in the context of
              | the research project entitled “Labour market dynamics, family development
              | •
              | •

              | and generative conduct” in 1986, promoted by the DFG, which included 793
              | women and 783 men of the cohorts born in 1950 and 1955 from Düssel-
              | dorf, Hannover, Bochum, Gelsenkirchen, Gronau, Ahaus, Vreden and Leer.
              | For each child of these respondents, the family biographies contain both the
              | actual birth order and the birth order information used by the West German
              | Statistical Ofﬁce at that time. From the corresponding relative frequencies
              | (obtained for single ages of the mothers by means of linear regression mod-
              | elling), both the parity-speciﬁc births in marriage, and the non-marital births
              | which were recorded in ofﬁcial statistics on a non-parity-speciﬁc basis, were
              | transferred into an estimate of the biological parities by single age of the
              | mother. The authors used constant parity-speciﬁc subdivisions as obtained
              | from the project sample for both the children born in wedlock and those born
              | out of wedlock for every year from 1958 to 1985.
              | Kreyenfeld (2002) combined the ofﬁcial birth numbers for West respective
              | Western Germany from 1985 to 1995 with parity-speciﬁc frequencies de-
              | rived from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) similarly to Birg et al. (1990).
              | However, only the non-marital births of the SOEP samples for West/Western
              | Germany and for foreigners (211 cases in total) were used for the subdivision
              | into the respective birth orders by means of a time-variable multinomial logit
              | model. As a consequence of this modelling procedure, the estimated age-
              | speciﬁc parity distributions differ slightly from year to year, in contrast to the
              | estimates of Birg et al. (1990). For marital births, Kreyenfeld (2002) used the
              | ofﬁcial data on birth order of parents who were married to one another.
              | For the years 1995 to 1999 (Western Germany) and 1995 to 2000 (Eastern
              | Germany) we could use the data of the perinatal survey compiled and kindly
              | made available by Dr. Manfred Voigt (University of Greifswald). This survey
              | has been carried out since the 1980s directly in West German birth clinics
              | with the aim of improving the quality of perinatal medicine. Participation
              | in the survey, which was conducted by the Bundesländer themselves until
              | 2000, has been obligatory for all clinics since 1995 (see Goerke/Lack 2000;
              | Kreyenfeld et al. 2010). In contrast to ofﬁcial statistics, the perinatal survey
              | includes the birth order for all births a woman has ever had. Because of the
              | aim and the method of the survey, the perinatal survey exclusively contains
              | births which took place in clinics, what applies to the majority of all births
              | in Germany. Dr. Voigt was able to collect the perinatal survey data for all the
              | Federal Länder with the exception of Baden-Württemberg. Despite the ob-
              | ligatory participation for all hospitals, the dataset for the years 1995 to 1997
              | contains only approx. 70 % of all 1,656,339 births registered in Germany
              | during these years. The percentages for the single calendar years are about
              | 65 % in 1995, 78 % in 1996 and 66 % in 1997. Nevertheless, the availability of
              | the data for the Federal Länder enabled us to estimate parity-speciﬁc propor-
              | tions of births by the age of the mothers for Eastern and Western Germany
              | separately. For this purpose we used the absolute numbers without addi-

              | tional smoothing. Since Berlin is included as one overall unit in the perinatal
              | survey – as in the ofﬁcial statistics from 2000 onwards – we excluded the
              | capital from our analysis.
              | Kreyenfeld et al. (2010) also used the data of the perinatal survey, which have
              | been compiled for the whole federal territory since the beginning of the 21st
              | Century by the German National Institute for Quality in Healthcare (Bundes-
              | geschäftsstelle Qualitätssicherung), to estimate parity-speciﬁc birth num-
              | bers for the years from 2001 to 2008. But also these data are only virtually
              | complete from 2004 onwards. Some hospitals as well as entire Bundesländer
              | are missing in the years before, such as Hessen, Schleswig-Holstein and the
              | Saarland in 2001. The authors report that 4,978,381 births are recorded (and
              | useable) for the entire period from 2001 to 2008, corresponding to 89 % of
              | all births registered in Germany in these years. The shares in 2001, 2002 and
              | 2003 are however only between 62 and 85 %. Kreyenfeld et al. (2010) pro-
              | vide the parity-speciﬁc birth numbers derived from these data separately for
              | Eastern and Western Germany, with all of Berlin being allocated to Eastern
              | Germany. Like the data from the perinatal survey from 1995 to 1999 respec-
              | tive 2000 (see above), the data used by Kreyenfeld et al. (2010) are based
              | solely on births which took place in hospitals. Using data from Germany’s
              | ofﬁcial health reporting (Gesundheitsberichterstattung des Bundes) and sta-
              | tistics of the Association for Quality in Out-of-Hospital Births (Gesellschaft
              | für Qualität in der außerklinischen Geburtshilfe e.V. – QUAG), the authors
              | found that roughly one to two percent of all births took place outside hospi-
              | tals between 2001 and 2008. Although these ﬁgures include primarily higher-
              | parity births, taking them into account only leads to negligible changes in the
              | parity-speciﬁc subdivision derived from the data of the perinatal survey (see
              | Kreyenfeld et al. 2010).
              | • In order to close the gap arising from the above mentioned data sources
              | for Western Germany in the year 2000, we also analyzed the parity-speciﬁc
              | birth numbers of ofﬁcial statistics for the period 1998 to 2002. As has al-
              | ready been described, these ﬁgures only include children born to parents
              | who are currently married to one another including their joint pre-marital
              | children. The quality of the TFR* estimated on the basis of these data mainly
              | depends on the extent of deviations between the average age at childbirth of
              | the women by the biological birth order and by the birth order in the current
              | marriage. Analysing the new ofﬁcial statistics for 2009 one asserts that this
              | extent mainly depends on the proportion of non-marital births (Statistisches
              | Bundesamt 2010). The difference between the age of the mother at the ﬁrst
              | birth in the current marriage and the age of the mother at the ﬁrst birth in her
              | life was 0.9 years in Western Germany in 2009 with the proportion of extra-
              | marital ﬁrst births being 36 %. The proportion of extra-marital births was
              | smaller among second and further births, namely between 17 % and 19 %,
              | and the corresponding age difference was only 0.3 years. The inﬂuence of
              | Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 613
              | re-marriage was weak: 93 % of ﬁrst births in the current marriage in 2009
              | were also the ﬁrst births in the life of the mother. The concordance between
              | biological and marital birth order was even larger in second and further
              | births. Thus, since the proportion of births of unmarried women among all
              | live births in Western Germany in the years 1998 to 2002 was between 16 %
              | and 21 % (Statistisches Bundesamt 2008, Tab. 1.1.1 to 1.1.3), the information
              | on the marital birth order forms a relatively sound basis for estimating the
              | TFR*. The situation for Eastern Germany is different what prohibits using the
              | information from ofﬁcial statistics on the marital birth order: The proportion
              | of extra-marital births is much larger than in Western Germany. The propor-
              | tion of extra-marital births among ﬁrst births was 74 % in 2009, and among
              | second and further births it was still far above 40 %. The difference between
              | the age at the ﬁrst birth in the life of the woman and the age at the ﬁrst birth in
              | the current marriage was 2.3 years. Between second and further births, the
              | age difference was 0.9 and 0.8 years, respectively. Furthermore, 20 % of the
              | women had already given birth before the ﬁrst child in the current marriage
              | was born. The proportion of extra-marital births in the new Federal Länder
              | in the period between 1998 and 2002 was more than twice as high as in the
              | West, and it increased more rapidly: from 47 % in 1998 to 55 % in 2002.
              | Table 1 summarizes the data sources used. As far as we know, these contain
              | the only data existing for the German population which provide the subdivision of
              | births into ﬁrst births (parity 1), second births (parity 2), third births (parity 3) and
              | higher-order births (parity 4+) for the years 1955 to 2008. Since the case numbers
              | in the data sources used differ from the total number of births registered in Western
              | and Eastern Germany, the relative parity-speciﬁc subdivision of births, calculated
              | from the data sources, was applied to the total number of births in Western and
              | Eastern Germany as published by the statistical ofﬁce. In formal terms, the age- and
              | parity-speciﬁc numbers of births B(x)i were estimated as follows:
              | with B(x) denoting the ofﬁcial overall number of births of x-year-old women, and
              | B(x)i
              | B(x)  B' (x)i
              | B' (x)
              | (10)
              | B‘(x)i and B‘(x), respectively, denoting the number of births of parity i of x-year-old
              | women as well as the corresponding total number of births included in the respec-
              | tive data source. From these age- and parity-speciﬁc birth numbers and from the
              | numbers of living women aged 15 to 49 published by the statistical ofﬁce, it was
              | possible to derive age- and parity-speciﬁc fertility rates for single ages of the moth-
              | ers which ﬁnally enabled us to estimate the parity-speciﬁc TFRi from equation (2) as
              | well as the parity-speciﬁc age at childbirth MABi from equation (8). The tempo-ad-
              | justed total fertility rates TFR* were ﬁnally calculated as shown in equation (9). For
              | parities 1, 2 and 3 we used the tempo-adjusted TFR1*, TFR2* and TFR3* (calculated

              | In a ﬁrst step, we subdivided the total number of births by the age of the mother for
              | Western and Eastern Germany published by the Statistical Ofﬁce of Germany into
              | the parities on the basis of the parity distributions reconstructed from the various
              | data sources. From these parity-speciﬁc birth numbers, we decomposed the con-
              | Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 615
              | ventional total fertility rate TFR – as described in the previous section – into parities
              | 1, 2, 3 and 4+. The corresponding estimates for TFR1, TFR2, TFR3 and TFR4+ for
              | each calendar year can be found in Annex 1.
              | Figure 1 shows the proportions of the parity-speciﬁc TFRi from 1958 to 2008 cal-
              | culated from these data. Although the time trends of the parity-speciﬁc proportions
              | of the TFR reveal interesting differences between Western and Eastern Germany,
              | both parts of the country resemble each other in the fact that total fertility is mainly
              | determined by parities 1 and 2. All in all, ﬁrst and second born children account for
              | 70 % (from the end of the 1950s until the 1960s) to 80-85 % (since the 1970s in East-
              | ern Germany and since the 1980s in Western Germany) of the total number of live
              | births in the analyzed period. The proportions of parity 3 remain largely constant in
              | both Western and Eastern Germany, whilst births of fourth and higher order have
              | clearly become less signiﬁcant since the 1970s in both parts of Germany and are of
              | only minor signiﬁcance for total fertility. With regard to the tempo effect component
              | in the conventional TFR it is therefore of primary relevance how the average age
              | at childbirth of mothers of ﬁrst and second children has changed in the analyzed
              | calendar years.

              | Figures 2a to 2d present the annual changes in the average parity-speciﬁc age
              | at childbirth ri for the same observation period estimated from the age- and parity-
              | speciﬁc numbers of births. The values for parity 1 in Western Germany (black dots
              | in Fig. 2a) are to be found exclusively in the negative range until the beginning of
              | the 1970s. This means that the average age of women giving birth for the ﬁrst time
              | is continuously decreased during these years. The situation is similar for the aver-
              | age age at childbirth of parities 2 (shown in Fig. 2a by white triangles) and 3 (star
              | signature in Fig. 2c). Consequently, one can presume that tempo effects increased
              | the conventional TFR in the years of the baby boom. The changes in the average age
              | of the mothers of children of fourth and higher order (grey squares in Fig. 2c) show a
              | trend in contrast to parities 1 and 2 between the mid-1960s and the beginning of the
              | 1970s. Because of the minor signiﬁcance of parity 4+ for total fertility, this can only
              | result in a slight reduction of the tempo effects caused by parities 1, 2 and 3. From
              | the 1970s to the end of the 1990s, all parities show an almost permanent annual
              | increase in the average age at childbirth in Western Germany, albeit with varying
              | intensities. Above all in parity 1, the annual changes are more than 0.1 years in most
              | calendar years, with the maximum value of 0.26 being reached in 1983. Only in the
              | second half of the 1980s the values for r1 are around zero. Since the early 1990s,
              | there is a rise in the annual increase again, with an overall upward trend until the last
              | year of observation. The changes in the other parities are very similar over the entire
              | period. In the last years of the observation period, the annual change in the average
              | age at childbirth among parities 1 to 3 is between 0.15 and 0.20 years, so that the
              | TFR in Western Germany was inﬂuenced most by tempo effects in the 1970s and
              | early 1980s as well as since the early 1990s.
              | In Eastern Germany, the values for ri of all parities ﬂuctuate around zero from the
              | mid-1960s until the end of the 1980s (see Figs. 2b and 2d). The few exceptions relate
              | to parities 2, 3 and 4+ for a short time around 1970 and to parity 4+ at the end of the
              | 1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s. All in all, the conventional TFR in Eastern
              | Germany should be more or less unaffected by tempo effects in this period. Since
              | uniﬁcation, the trends have changed considerably. Unfortunately, for the years be-
              | tween 1987 and 1996 the change in the average age at childbirth cannot be esti-
              | mated. However, the ri values derived for the years from 1996 to 2000 are – above
              | all for parities 1 and 2 – very high and much higher than in Western Germany. The
              | dashed interpolated lines in Figures 2b and 2d between 1987 and 1996 are included
              | to provide an impression of the massive changes which occurred in the ages at
              | childbirth among Eastern German mothers during the 1990s. These lines cannot be
              | used to estimate the ri values for the single years of this period, which could indeed
              | have been rather above the level of 1996 particularly in the ﬁrst half of the 1990s.
              | However, they indicate that the extremely low TFR of Eastern Germany in this pe-
              | riod is caused to a considerable degree by tempo effects. From the beginning of the
              | 20th century on the annual change in the average age at childbirth returns to a level
              | of around 0.2 years among parities 1 and 2, and is hence similar to the West German
              | level. The ﬂuctuations are larger in parities 3 and 4+ with many of the single values
              | being around zero. However, as can be seen in Figure 1b, the changes in the ages at

              | childbirth of the mothers of third and further children have only a minor inﬂuence on
              | the magnitude of the tempo effects.
              | The estimated annual changes in the parity-speciﬁc age at childbirth can be used
              | to adjust the TFRis for tempo effects according to the method proposed by Bon-
              | gaarts and Feeney (1998), and the resulting TFRi*s can then be cumulated to the
              | tempo-adjusted total fertility rate TFR* (the values for the TFRi* and the total TFR*
              | can be found for the single calendar years in Annex 2). Figure 3 shows the corre-
              | sponding estimates for Western Germany in comparison to the conventional TFR
              | (thin line). All in all, the estimates for the tempo-adjusted TFR* derived from the
              | various data sources (designated in Fig. 3 by different symbols) show a coherent
              | overall trend.
              | Since tempo adjustment with the method of Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) can
              | generally lead to distinct annual ﬂuctuations (and here additionally the combination
              | of different data sources), more robust results are obtained when averaging the
              | tempo-adjusted TFR* for three calendar years (see Goldstein et al. 2009). The result-
              | ing estimates for the TFR* of Western Germany can be found in Table 2a. The thick
              | black line in Fig. 3 represents the corresponding trend of the TFR* which reﬂects
              | the expectations that have already been outlined in connection with the trends in
              | the annual changes in parity-speciﬁc ages at childbirth. The TFR* is slightly below
              | the conventional TFR from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s because the age at child-
              | birth was falling at that time. This shows that the increase in the TFR at the begin-
              | ning of the baby boom in the 1950s was not only caused by the actual increase in
              | fertility but also to a slight degree by tempo effects. Similar results were shown for
              | instance for the USA (Bongaarts/Feeney 1998). At the end of the 1960s and at the
              | beginning of the 1970s, practically no differences can be found between the TFR
              | and the TFR*.
              | Since the early 1970s, the TFR* in Western Germany has been higher than the
              | conventional TFR. Whilst the TFR stagnated between 1.3 and 1.4 after the fertility
              | decline between the second half of the 1960s and the mid-1970s, the TFR* declined
              | less in the 1970s, and at the beginning of the 1980s the TFR* increased slightly to
              | about 1.7. The following years show a subsequent decrease in the TFR* that persist-
              | ed until 1990. Since then, the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate shows a more or less
              | continuous increase, reaching almost 1.7 in the last year of the observation period
              | (2008). All in all, although the TFR* is far from the replacement level of 2.1 children
              | per woman (upper dashed line in Fig. 3), it lies – in contrast to the conventional TFR
              | – clearly above the level of “lowest-low fertility”, which Kohler et al. (2002) deﬁned
              | as 1.3 children per woman (lower dashed line in Fig. 3).
              | The differences between the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted TFR*
              | also correspond to the expectations for Eastern Germany outlined above on the ba-
              | sis of the estimated annual changes in the average parity-speciﬁc age at childbirth.
              | In Figure 4 the corresponding estimates are, again displayed for the single years
              | and the trend in the three-year average of the TFR* (the respective values can be
              | found in Tab. 2b, as well as in Annex 2). It can be seen that tempo effects also led to
              | a slight increase in the total fertility rate during the 1950s in Eastern Germany which
              | is indicated by the somewhat lower values of the TFR* in comparison to the TFR.

              | In the subsequent years until the mid-1980s, the annual changes in the mothers’

              | sequently, there are virtually no differences between the TFR and the TFR* in this
              | period. This changes in the last years prior to reuniﬁcation during which the TFR* in
              | Eastern Germany rises in contrast to the decreasing TFR because of the increasing

              | feld et al. (2010)/ofﬁcial statistics (all births); the trend line of the TFR* is calculated from
              | the three-year moving average (values for the mid calendar years can be found in Tab.
              | 2); for the calendar years 1987-1996, the trend for the TFR* in Eastern Germany (years
              | without estimate) was completed by linear interpolation of the values for 1986 and 1997
              | (dashed line); the parity-speciﬁc TFRi*s for the single calendar years can be found in An-

              | A direct East-West comparison of fertility trends in Germany is presented in Fig-
              | ure 5 according to the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted TFR*. The trends
              | in the conventional TFR can be found in Figure 5a and the trends in the tempo-
              | adjusted TFR* can be found in Figure 5b. Interestingly, both variants of calculation
              | show the same phases in which the total fertility rate is higher in Eastern or Western
              | Germany. However, the differences in the tempo-adjusted TFR* in the two parts of
              | Germany are smaller in each phase (and since the second half of the 1990s almost
              | negligible). (Note once more that the dashed sections in the line of the TFR* for
              | Eastern Germany are no real estimates, but represent the interpolated connection
              | between the estimates for 1986 and 1997.) Besides this, the graphical West-East
              | comparison of the total fertility rate by means of the two calculation variants pro-
              | vides one more important result: fertility had virtually disappeared at the end of the

              | Finally, Figure 6 (Western Germany) and Figure 7 (Eastern Germany) show the
              | trends in the TFR as well as in the TFR* in comparison to three other western and

              | The trends of the conventional TFR in Western Germany, Austria, the Netherlands
              | and Sweden shown in Figure 6a reﬂect the already known fact that the West Ger-
              | man fertility level is located at the low end of the range in other western European
              | populations. Austria is comparable to Western Germany with regard to the level and
              | trend of the TFR since the 1980s (the HFD provides data for Austria only since this
              | time). In Sweden and in the Netherlands, the TFR has increased in the last ten years,
              | in contrast to the stagnation observed in Western Germany and Austria, where it
              | ranges around the level of 1.8 to 1.9 in most recent years. Figure 6b reveals that
              | the estimates for the TFR* of Western Germany are also close to the correspond-
              | ing values of Austria, for which age- and parity-speciﬁc birth numbers of the total
              | population are published directly by the national statistical ofﬁce (Statistik Austria).
              | This ﬁnding holds for the mid-1990s onwards. In the years before, at around 1990,
              | the Austrian TFR* shows a strong ﬂuctuation which is not visible in the conventional
              | TFR. All in all, the estimates for the TFR* of Western Germany ﬁt well and plausible
              | into the picture of the Western European populations. Only in the 1980s and early
              | 624 • Marc Luy, Olga Pötzsch
              | 1990s the estimates for the TFR* seem somewhat too low. An interesting result is
              | that in the most recent years the differences in the total fertility rate between West-
              | ern Germany and Austria, on the one hand, and Sweden and the Netherlands, on the
              | other, are much smaller when the TFR is tempo adjusted.
              | Figure 7 also includes one population which seems suitable for comparison with
              | Eastern Germany in order to judge the plausibility of our tempo-adjusted estimates.
              | Roughly since 1980, Slovenia shows a similar trend in the conventional TFR com-
              | pared to that of Eastern Germany. In the 1990s, however, both differ when no fer-
              | tility changes comparable to those in Eastern Germany occurred in Slovenia (see
              | Fig. 7a). The two other populations, from the Czech and Slovak Republics, exhibit a
              | much higher TFR until the mid-1990s, but show similar changes in the fertility level
              | as the East German population in the ﬁrst half of the 1990s (albeit without recovery
              | after the baby bust). The comparison of the estimates for the East German tempo-
              | adjusted TFR* with the corresponding ﬁgures for the three other populations in
              | Figure 7b also shows that the estimates for Eastern Germany seem highly plausible.

text          | Discussion
              | As already mentioned in the introduction, the main aim of the work for this article
              | was the compilation of a time series of estimates for the tempo-adjusted total fer-
              | tility rate in Western and Eastern Germany. To achieve this, we used a variety of
              | data sources from which age- and parity-speciﬁc birth numbers could be derived to
              | serve as basis for estimating the tempo-adjusted TFR*. It was possible to construct
              | a complete time series for Western Germany for the years from 1960 to 2007. For
              | Eastern Germany, however, it was not possible to provide such a complete time
              | series. We were able to present estimates (by means of three year averages) for
              | the years 1956 to 1986 and for 1997 to 2007 (the estimates for single calendar years
              | cover the years 1959-2008 for Western Germany and the years 1955-1987 as well as
              | 1996-2008 for Eastern Germany).
              | Although the idea behind Bongaarts and Feeney’s tempo approach (not only for
              | fertility but also for all other demographic events) as well as the arguments of the
              | critics are described in Luy (2010), we should add a few remarks with regard to the
              | interpretation and correct attribution of the tempo-adjusted time series presented
              | in this paper. Particularly the question of the interpretation of the tempo-adjusted
              | total fertility rate is not easy to answer, and has already led to a number of misun-
              | derstandings in the corresponding demographic literature. The advantage of the
              | conventional TFR is its clear deﬁnition and interpretation as the sum of the age-spe-
              | ciﬁc fertility rates observed in a given calendar year. In order to explain the meaning
              | of the TFR* as intended by Bongaarts and Feeney, it is necessary to describe this
              | indicator in a broader context.
              | Independent of the calculation variant (conventional or tempo-adjusted), the aim
              | of the calculation of the total fertility rate for a period is to provide a cross-sectional
              | measure of a population’s current fertility. Therefore, only women who are aged
              | between 15 and 49 in the calendar year under observation, i.e. women hence be-
              | longing to 35 different cohorts, are considered. The current fertility of these women
              | is inﬂuenced to differing degrees by the current political and societal framework
              | and their own reproduction histories. In order to obtain a better understanding of a
              | period measure, one might imagine that the current age-speciﬁc fertility conditions
              | are used to construct a scenario for a hypothetical population. All the women of
              | this hypothetical population would realise precisely the given age-speciﬁc fertility
              | at any time. In such a scenario, all female cohorts would have the same ﬁnal aver-
              | age number of children, which equals the average number of children of all women
              | 626 • Marc Luy, Olga Pötzsch
              | aged between 15 and 49 living in each calendar year. Demographers refer to such a
              | scenario as a “stable population”.
              | A real population whose current fertility is to be characterised by the total fertil-
              | ity rate is naturally never stable. Consequently, period indicators derived in the logic
              | of the stable population always have to be regarded as purely hypothetical. The
              | idea behind Bongaarts and Feeney’s tempo approach is based on the fact that the
              | number of births and the number of women aged between 15 to 49 living in a spe-
              | ciﬁc calendar year do not originate from a stable population. Imagine a rather simple
              | exemplary case in which each woman has exactly one child, gives birth at exactly
              | the same age, and that the times of the births are evenly distributed over the year. In
              | this scenario, the sum of the age-speciﬁc fertility rates as an indicator of the current
              | fertility would also be exactly one child per woman in any given calendar year. If,
              | however, the age at which the women give birth to their child continually increases
              | (so that a change in birth timing takes place, but not in birth quantum), the cohorts
              | of women being in reproductive ages in a calendar year would have their children
              | over a longer period than one year. In this case, all women living in a speciﬁc calen-
              | dar year would still realise one birth during their lives, but the average value derived
              | from the age-speciﬁc fertility rates for this year would be lower than one.
              | Bongaarts and Feeneys’ approach for characterising the fertility of a speciﬁc cal-
              | endar year takes into account that the current fertility of a real population does not
              | originate from a situation in which the age at childbirth of all cohorts currently living
              | remains unchanged. The idea is hence to adjust the time frames of the birth times
              | of the newborns and of the cohorts of mothers (i.e. the numerators and denomina-
              | tors of the age-speciﬁc fertility rates) to capture the current birth quantum of the
              | currently living women. The adjustment relates exclusively to the above described
              | expansion effect of the birth period resulting from the increase in the age at child-
              | birth, assuming that the fertility quantum remains unchanged despite the age shift
              | (analogously, when the age at childbirth declines, the reduction effect of the shorter
              | childbirth period would be adjusted for).
              | In a stable population, the total fertility rate of a calendar year can be regarded
              | as the average number of children born during the life course of all female cohorts
              | currently living. In these terms, the conventional period TFR (i.e. the observed to-
              | tal fertility rate of a speciﬁc calendar year) can also be interpreted as the average
              | number of children born by the female cohorts living at the same time in the hypo-
              | thetical population in the course of their reproductive life span. The prerequisite is
              | that these female cohorts realise exactly the age-speciﬁc fertility rates observed in
              | the period, i.e. without changes in birth quantum and birth timing. The tempo-ad-
              | justed TFR* is to be equivalently interpreted as the average number of children who
              | are born to the hypothetical female cohorts living at the same time in the course of
              | their reproductive life span if these female cohorts realise the birth quantum of the
              | period observed, deﬁned by the age-speciﬁc fertility rates, but with changes in birth
              | timing. When we reduce the interpretation to the single hypothetical cohort usually
              | used, then the TFR* does not reﬂect the age-speciﬁc fertility rates observed in the
              | period, but the age-speciﬁc fertility rates adjusted for changes in the birth timing
              | during the observed year (see also Lesthaeghe/Willems 1999).
              | Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 627
              | Besides the aspects of birth quantum and birth timing, the age distribution of the
              | parity-speciﬁc fertility rates by the age of the women is also relevant with regard
              | to the tempo adjustment according to the Bongaarts and Feeney formula used in
              | this article. It becomes evident from equation (6) that the tempo adjustment is ex-
              | clusively based on the change in the average age at childbirth of the parities. Thus,
              | the Bongaarts and Feeney formula implies that the distribution of the age-speciﬁc
              | fertility rates remains constant when shifting with age. Most of the methodical crit-
              | ics of tempo adjustment focus on this feature of the Bongaarts and Feeney method
              | (see e.g. van Imhoff/Keilman 2000; Kohler/Philipov 2001; van Imhoff 2001; Yi/Land
              | 2001). In real populations, the changes in the average age at childbirth are indeed
              | accompanied by variance changes which also exert an inﬂuence on the number of
              | children born in a calendar year. Thus, the increase in the average age at childbirth
              | can be caused by both an increase in age-speciﬁc fertility in the higher reproductive
              | age and by a fall in the fertility rates among younger women (in the ﬁrst case, the
              | fertility quantum would increase in the long term; in the latter it would fall). Conse-
              | quently, very different changes in the age distribution of the parity-speciﬁc fertility
              | rates can lead to identical changes in the average age at childbirth, and hence to an
              | identical tempo adjustment with the Bongaarts and Feeney formula. Such cases are
              | not rare and can also be observed in the German population during the calendar
              | years analysed in this paper.
              | Theoretically it is possible to extend the tempo adjustment to include the effect
              | of changes in the age distribution of the parity-speciﬁc fertility rates as proposed
              | by Kohler and Philipov (2001). In practice, however, feasibility reaches its limit here
              | in most cases because of the detailed nature of the data required. It is therefore
              | important to note that the tempo adjustment with the Bongaarts and Feeney for-
              | mula is merely an approximation of the intended adjustment of the total fertility
              | rate (see Luy 2010 for details). However, the criticism of the non-consideration of
              | variance effects can be countered by two arguments: The ﬁrst concerns the relative
              | signiﬁcance of changes in the average age at childbirth and in the age distribution
              | of the age-speciﬁc fertility rates for the numbers of births occurring in a speciﬁc
              | calendar year. As Dinkel (1989) has shown by simulations, changes in the average
              | age at childbirth have a much larger impact on the birth numbers than changes in
              | the variance of the fertility distribution. It is not likely that the non-consideration of
              | variance changes leading to an incorrect direction of the tempo adjustment with
              | the Bongaarts and Feeney formula occurs frequently, albeit its absolute extent can
              | indeed be distorted. The second argument is that the conventional TFR does not
              | at all account for changes in birth timing. Consequently, also Kohler and Philipov
              | (2001) concluded that an adjustment of the total fertility rate with the Bongaarts and
              | Feeney formula is better for the analysis of period fertility than completely exclud-
              | ing tempo adjustment.
              | This discussion, however, is not aimed to ascertain which measure is better
              | suited to characterise period fertility. One should not forget that the TFR and the
              | TFR* are both pure period indicators, and hence both solely reﬂect hypothetical
              | average birth numbers. In case of the conventional TFR, this hypothetical average
              | birth number is based on the observed fertility rates of a calendar year, and in the
              | 628 • Marc Luy, Olga Pötzsch
              | case of the tempo-adjusted TFR* on the estimated birth quantum of the women liv-
              | ing in this calendar year. The latter cannot be measured, but only modelled, which
              | is certainly a weakness of the TFR* compared to the conventional total fertility rate.
              | Ultimately, the two indicators are based on somewhat different reference quanti-
              | ties. For the analysis of period fertility it is thus most informative to use them par-
              | allel and supplementing one another, as it was done in all the papers listed in the
              | introduction.
              | Regarding the empirical results presented in this article, it can be stated that
              | the two fertility indicators – the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted TFR* –
              | identify different phases in fertility trends in Western and Eastern Germany. In both
              | parts of the country, the TFR* is lower than the TFR until the end of the 1960s. This
              | is a consequence of the decline in the average age at childbirth, in particular with
              | regard to the ﬁrst and second births. The age of the women at the birth of their chil-
              | dren rises markedly in Western Germany in the 1970s and 1980s. As a consequence,
              | the tempo-adjusted TFR* is on average almost 0.18 higher than the conventional
              | TFR during the years from 1971 to 1987. In the former GDR, by contrast, the age at
              | childbirth remained relatively constant in this period, so that the tempo-adjusted
              | TFR* and the conventional TFR do not differ signiﬁcantly. Since the beginning of the
              | 1990s, the average age at childbirth of Western German women rises once more
              | after a brief phase of relative stability. This trend causes an increasing deviation be-
              | tween the estimated TFR* and the conventional TFR in Western Germany. In Eastern
              | Germany, we can only presume that the difference between the two indicators was
              | particularly large in the ﬁrst half of the 1990s. This is suggested by several indica-
              | tors pointing towards a rapid increase in the age at childbirth of Eastern German
              | mothers. An idea of the extent of this difference is provided by the estimates for
              | the second half of the 1990s. The difference between the tempo-adjusted TFR* and
              | the conventional TFR in the years 1997-1999 is between 0.37 and 0.43. In the years
              | from 2000 to 2007, the TFR* in Eastern Germany is on average 0.28 higher than the
              | conventional TFR.
              | Hence, the combined picture of the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted
              | TFR* provides interesting results with regard to the trends in period fertility in West-
              | ern and Eastern Germany, which were not analysed in detail in this paper. This ap-
              | plies above all to the West-East differences in the overall trend and the massive
              | tempo effects in Eastern Germany during the 1990s. Since 2009 it is possible to
              | analyse level and trends of fertility in Germany with tempo-adjusted fertility rates
              | on the basis of parity-speciﬁc data for all births from ofﬁcial statistics. For the period
              | prior to this we have compiled the best possible estimates. Even if these estimates
              | are not comparable with the data of ofﬁcial statistics in qualitative terms, the data
              | presented in this paper enables researchers to include the population of Western
              | and Eastern Germany in future research on international trends in tempo-adjusted
              | period fertility.
