              | ABSTRACT
              | Prompt advancement in product / service and process technology, many operations in the
              | manufacturing and service industries in recent years require competitive HR practices. So this research
              | study stresses on HR planning and audit practices. HR planning is all about good management; good
              | strategic management; good business management and particularly good people management. It is
              | important that you put thought and careful planning into your human resource practices. And the
              | purpose of the HR Audit is to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the HR function to identify areas of
              | strength and weakness and where improvements may be needed. Conducting an audit involves a
              | review of current practices, policies, and procedures, and may include benchmarking against
              | organizations of similar size and/or industry. This research aims to figure out the practices, employee
              | perception and measures adopted by HEG limited for Human resource planning and audit. Chi square
              | test is applied at (.05 or 5 %) significance level in this paper to check the authenticity of data given by
              | the respondents. Findings suggests that it is difficult to assess accurate HR planning and adopting
              | accurate audit practices because practices itself does not produce right or wrong answers, but it
              | produces a series of alternatives from which the right course of action can be chosen.
              | Keywords: Workforce; Measures; Technology; career progression; Policy implementation etc.
              | 1. INTRODUCTION
              | The historical role of Human Resources has changed spectacularly since its inception in
              | the early 1900s. Formerly it was mainly a clerical function but now human resource is a
              | strategic partner in planning and attaining organizational policies and goals. Today’s business
              | climate puts the obligation on the HR department to accept the challenge of doing more with
              | less, while contributing value toward business objectives. Human resources also has to
              | address the rapidly changing conditions affecting the type of employees required and their
              | changing needs, so the function requires flexible and knowledgeable practitioners. Hence HR
              | planning has become an integral part of business. All companies, organizations, institutions
              | consist of people and are meant to serve the people with products and services. Humans,
              | therefore, are not only the resources of organizations but are the main instrument of their

text          | progress. It is not enough to say „people are our most precious asset of business. Instead we
              | must say our company or organization (including its results) is a creation of our people.
              | In order to pace the talk of being a “business partner,” HR managers have to provide
              | real evidence that they are having a strategic business impact. Management is often asking,
              | “How are we doing?” However, this is not always an easy question to answer. This is
              | especially so, when it is difficult to obtain some type of objective measuring tool to determine
              | how well a certain HR function is performing. To validate the claim of being “business
              | partners”, HR managers must clearly demonstrate how HR services can accomplish the
              | business objectives set forth by the organization. The HR function is often overlooked for
              | audits/measurement tools, to assess its effectiveness and legal regulatory compliance.
              | However, the HR Audit is a process that sets the stage for a true transformation in HR
              | strategy and services. It links HR systems and services to organizational objectives while
              | focusing on the business needs of internal customers.
              | The success of a business is directly linked to the performance of those who work for
              | that business. Underachievement can be a result of workplace failures. Because hiring the
              | wrong people or failing to anticipate fluctuations in hiring needs can be costly, it is important
              | that you put effort into human resource planning. Planning for HR needs will help to ensure
              | your employees have the skills and competencies your business needs to succeed. It will
              | better prepare you for staff turnover, recruitment, and strategic hiring – and improve stress
              | when you have emergency/last-minute hiring needs. With effective human resource planning,
              | HR audit implies critical examination and evaluation of policies, programs and procedures in
              | human resource management. [4,5]
              | 2. DOES HR PLANNING AND AUDIT MATTERS?
              | In essence, workforce or HR planning is about predicting future labor market needs. It
              | requires an understanding of the make-up of the current workforce, an investigation into
              | future service needs and an analysis of the type and size of workforce required to meet them.
              | It is becoming increasingly important for agencies as they adopt new ways of operating in
              | order to adapt to changes.
              | The challenge will be to ensure that agencies can minimize the costs and grab the
              | opportunities that such changes brings - quicker career progression, effective recruitment, and
              | more flexible job design and workforce deployment. By identifying workforce capabilities
              | and by considering what will be needed in the future and planning systematically, managers
              | can limit the risks associated with unanticipated events. In particular, HR planning will help
              | organizations to:
              | 
              | 
              | 
              | 
              | Identify potential problems, manage risk and minimize crisis management cycles.
              | Contain human resources costs, including the cost of turnover, absenteeism, structural
              | changes and staff movements.
              | Develop workforce skills that take time to grow.
              | Optimize the use of human, financial and other resources. [4]

              | Apart from it the reason for conducting an HR audit is to find out how effective and
              | efficient the organization’s HR activities are and to determine the areas for improvement and
              | identify changes. The purpose of the HR Audit is to conduct a more in depth analysis of the
              | HR function to identify areas of strength and weakness and where improvements may be
              | needed. Conducting an audit involves a review of current practices, policies, and procedures,
              | and may include benchmarking against organizations of similar size and/or industry. An HR
              | Audit in effect includes five different components.
              | Functional Audit
              | This aspect of the HR audit examines:
              |  Your HRD systems and procedures, encompassing training and development, organization
              | development and career development.
              |  Whether your HRD systems and procedures are aligned with the HRM systems and
              | procedures to promote competence, confidence and performance. This includes job
              | design, HR planning, performance management systems, selection and staffing.
              |  Fairness and consistency in compensation and benefits, employee relations and your HR
              | record keeping, particularly in regard to providing timely management information.

text          | Service Audit
              | This aspect of the audit activity looks at the service responsiveness and reliability of the
              | HR function. This will include an assessment of such things as response times, willingness to
              | help line managers/staff, and the knowledge of the HR staff etc.
              | Compliance Audit
              | This assesses the degree to which HR is compliant with the relevant legislation – e.g.
              | Labor Laws, etc. This part of the audit will assess whether the required policies, practices, and
              | procedures exist, and to what extent management and labor have been trained to enact these
              | codes of best practice.
              | Financial Management Audit
              | A comprehensive audit of HR systems and procedures needs to go beyond the
              | inspection level. Basic financial ratios/scorecard measures appropriate for a staff function like
              | HR need to be put in place to audit the efficiency of the various HR functions.
              | Strategic Audit
              | Each organization should have an overall people management strategy that aims to
              | increase the value of employees to the business. The strategic audit will examine whether the
              | HR strategy, policies and processes are aligned with and support the achievement of the
              | business’s mission and objectives.

              | Human Resource Management
              | HEG operates in an industry where technical competence and expertise is paramount.
              | The company maintains that Human Resources are a key driver of business growth.
              | Organizational Development
              | HEG believes that productivity enhancement comes from well-structured and focused
              | training and development programs. The Company continually endeavors to equip its
              | workforce with the latest tools and techniques to help them raise their level of efficiency and
              | effectiveness. In 2003, M/S Hewitt Associates were retained by HEG for HR Intervention and
              | initiatives broadly covering Job Evaluation, Performance Measurement, Competency
              | Assessment and Development, Organization Re-structuring and Reward Management. The
              | company has subsequently implemented most of the recommendations and is of the view that
              | each of these initiatives would go a long way in fostering an environment that allows
              | employees to fully utilize their abilities to perform better and to drive the performance of the
              | company.
              | Fostering a Quality-conscious organizational culture
              | Quality is not merely limited to being the cornerstone of HEG's sustainable competitive
              | advantage but is actively sought to be used as a facilitator of business growth. The Company
              | on its part, constantly engages its employees, programs aimed at ingraining a culture of
              | quality in its workforce. HEG has further extended the quality initiative to its processes via a
              | comprehensive Statistical Process Control System (SPC) based on Six Sigma Tools &
              | Techniques. This has enabled the Company to attain international standards in manufacturing
              | besides enhancing productivity. Moreover, the Company invites global consultants from time
              | to time to seek assistance in its efforts to continuously improve processes.
              | Performance Metrics and Remuneration
              | The Company manages a highly-motivated and capable team of employees. Besides, the
              | nature of the business requires that in-house competence and expertise be conserved and
              | developed. As a manifestation of that concept, HEG has outlined a performance management
              | system with the Balanced Score Card as the core. This seeks to not only motivate employees
              | but also attract fresh talent into the fold.
              | Competency Sustainment
              | Present-day best practices require that succession planning not be restricted to senior
              | management but also encompass key positions across relevant job categories. HEG as a truly
              | global and modern organization believes in preparing tomorrow's leaders today. To that end,
              | the Company has put in place an effective process to sustain a talent pool that can seamlessly
              | handle organizational change at all times.
              | Industrial Relations
              | HEG has consistently chosen to engage its unions and labor force while initiating major
              | changes that directly affect them. Furthermore, employees are empowered to bring to the fore
              | issues relevant to them from time to time. The manner of engagement between the
              | management and its workforce over the years has led to the creation of mutual understanding
              | and trust between the two. [1]

              | In conducting human resources audit, an employment policy or practice includes
              | contents shown in following Figure no. 2, but it is not limited to these contents only. It may
              | vary organization to organization.

              | 6. RATIONAL OF THE STUDY
              | Manpower or Human resources are asset for any organization and specifically for the
              | manufacturing units, where employees act as the talent warehouse.
              | Due to the importance of human resources, human resource planning is also in the
              | limelight. To utilize the employee’s efficiency it is imperative to have full description about
              | the employee as well as the job for which he is available.
              | Workforce planning will be critical to the HEG limited, as it administers the
              | generational change taking place in the workforce. Labor market supply and demand factors,
              | work and family considerations, and equity and diversity issues are rapidly taking place.
              | For example, The Company has an older age profile and its workforce is mature aged
              | and significant numbers of senior staff are approaching retirement, which means valuable
              | corporate knowledge could be lost.
              | Hence, in this dynamic scenario, the importance of human resource planning and audit
              | can’t be neglected. On the other hand Auditing HR practices require assessing the
              | arrangement of services offered by an HR department. Hence effective implementation of HR
              | policies secures utmost importance for which HR audit is conducted.
              | This research work focuses on practices, employee perception and measures adopted by
              | HEG for Human resource planning and audit.

              | 7. REVIEW OF LITERATURE
              | Sanjeev K. Bordoloi, Hirofumi Matsuo (2001) studies that because of rapid evolution in
              | product and process technology, many operations in the manufacturing and service industries
              | in recent years require workers to acquire and maintain more extensive ``knowledge stock''
              | than before. In this paper, we address the human resource planning in these knowledge-
              | intensive operations. We focus on the management of knowledge mix, that is, the mix of
              | workers in different knowledge levels. This research was conducted in a semiconductor
              | equipment manufacturing plant that uses an assembly line to achieve high productivity.
              | However, the plant also needs to increase ability to deal with a high degree of product
              | customization, frequent technology and product changes, and relatively low volume of
              | production, which collectively require a high level of knowledge development for each
              | worker. We extend methodology developed for managing production and work-in-process
              | inventory levels for a manufacturing system that is subject to random production yields.
              | However, the structure of our problem is different, and thus requires a separate mathematical
              | development. Our results indicate that the company we studied underestimated the ideal
              | number of workers in the higher knowledge levels in the steady state. But this problem, by
              | itself, can be taken care of by a good intuitive heuristic. We then demonstrate that our control
              | rule is superior to the good intuitive rule from the point of view of additional stability that is
              | obtained from less variability in the work force levels. We offer managerial implications of
              | this additional stability using our computational results [10].
              | Ghazala Ishrat, Javed Habib (2012) finds that in the changing economic and business
              | environment, proper Human Resource Management has assumed a crucial role in the growth
              | of the organization. It has become imperative to re-look at this most important asset of the
              | organization. The main objective behind this research was to gain in-depth knowledge of the
              | Human Resource and the effectiveness of HR functions within an organization. The HR audit
              | in University was planned to get a clear judgment about the overall status of most
              | faculties/Departments and to find out whether existing systems and procedures are yielding
              | desired result. This information will be an invaluable input while making strategic decisions.
              | The human resource audit involved examining current policies, practices and strategies of all
              | the departments/faculties to verify the effectiveness and helping University to improve its
              | productivity, transparency and efficiency. To conduct Human Resource Audit in University
              | extensive study on various aspects related to faculties, students and staff were analyzed and
              | studied through interviews of staff at various levels, observation of working of non teaching
              | staff, taking responses from students and staff by questionnaire method and documents review
              | at various levels. The firsthand experience has helped us in our specialization in HR as this
              | enhanced our prospective of thoughts. The concise suggestions/ recommendations emerged
              | after in depth analysis and study will provide with a wide scope to understand the functions
              | and mechanism of working in any organization [4].
              | Dr. Shikha N. Khera, Ms. Karishma Gulati (2012) states that Human resource information
              | system (HRIS) is not new concept but it is recuperating day by day with changing
              | environment. Its major role is in human resource planning (HRP) which itself a crucial
              | activity in any organization. Ineffective HRP can lead to extra or fewer numbers of employees
              | than needed. Both over and under number of employees can create crappy situations. HRIS
              | helps in proper planning of human resources. This paper focuses on the role of HRIS in HRP.
              | The research is empirical in nature as 127 respondents from top 7 IT companies (as per their
              | market share) are taken to see the sights of the objectives. The survey is done with the
              | International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 16
meta          | 51
text          | assistance of the questionnaire. After investigation it is concluded that HRIS has various
              | benefits but the foremost is HRIS stores ample data about the employees of the organizations
              | that helps in escalating the snail’s pace of HRP. HRIS also helps in the strategic activities of
              | HR managers and more in training and development, succession planning, applicant tracking
              | in recruitment and selection and manpower planning. While analyzing the overall contribution
              | of HRIS in HRP it is concluded that HRIS identifies occupied and unoccupied positions in an
              | organization very effectively and accurately [3].

              | Organization to take stock of the state of the science of human resources for health activities
              | in the year 2000. This paper provides an analysis of how labor market indicators can be
              | integrated into service planning, discusses whether planning is sufficiently responsive and
              | flexible to retain relevance and validity in rapidly changing health systems, describes different
              | models and approaches to linking and integrating workforce planning and service planning,
              | discusses methodological approaches to integrating planning, and examines effective
              | approaches to the use of computer based scenario modeling to support assessment of current
              | and future planning options. The context and broad cross-cutting themes of public sector,
              | political, social, and macro-economic changes have been considered. Where publications
              | exist, empirical evidence serves as the basis for this analysis and country examples have been
              | highlighted. While strides have been made in the practice of resource planning world-wide,
              | health human resource planning in most countries has been poorly conceptualized,
              | intermittent, varying in quality, profession specific in nature, and without adequate vision or
              | data upon which to base sound decisions [7].
              | Dave Ulrich (1997) studies that many talk about measuring human resources (HR), but get
              | lost because the issues are confusing. What to measure? How to measure it? When to
              | measure? Where to measure? These questions make measurement of HR difficult. This article
              | reviews the history of HR measurement; summarizes how HR measures may be done for
              | professionals, practices, and functions; and offers specific guidelines for improving HR
              | measures [2].
              | Mark S. Van Clieaf (1992) studies that new approaches to executive search and executive
              | resource planning are required if these functions are to have a strategic impact on improving
              | organizational performance. The need to map and match specific executive perspectives and
              | competencies to the future needs of the business is required if executive search and executive
              | resource planning are to become strategic management tools. This paper examines the three
              | “drivers” of strategic leadersbip and provides a framework for synchronizing specific
              | executive perspectives and competencies to these three drivers. A case study illustrates bow
              | common practices such as raiding direct competitors for executive talent or always promoting
              | from within may be counterproductive to the strategic needs of the business.
              | Recommendations for applying these new concepts at the board corporate, and strategic
              | business unit level are made [8].
              | 8. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
              | The research study is a descriptive study. Questionnaire is designed to collect the data
              | from various employees and a few officials from HR department of HEG limited located at
              | Bhopal (M.P.) [6].

              | Resources Audit is a comprehensive method (or means) to review current human resources
              | policies, procedures, documentation and systems to identify needs for improvement and
              | enhancement of the HR function as well as to ensure compliance with ever-changing rules
              | and regulations. An Audit involves systematically reviewing all aspects of human resources.
              | HR audit helps to link the long term purpose, goals and objectives of the HR function/HR
              | plans. It also examines what people are presently doing in their jobs in the organization. It
              | examines and analyze what kinds of people are doing the work at present and the present
              | strengths and weaknesses of the HR policies. Finally it compares present and future
              | jobs/people/HR practices.
              | SUGGESTIONS
              |  Changing culture requires leaders to understand the learning process dynamics and how
              | the learning and unlearning of assumptions and beliefs can be manipulated to modify human
              | needs and behavior.
              |  Effective HR audit requires equal standards against which procedures and
              | implementation of policies are assessed. In the absence of equal standards, policies are
              | assessed with subjectivity, which may destroy the process of audit.
              |  One training program should not be designed to serve a numerous of purposes because it
              | may be unclear and difficult & results into failure. The solution is to separate training and
              | assessment program should be designed for development of employees.
              |  HR planning should be job-related. Job description should be given to the employees.
              | Bring them into the line of organization's goals with the job objectives so that every
              | employee’s work lead to the organizational goal.
              |  Since the goal of HR planning system is to achieve the organizational goal. Hence there
              | is immense need to coach the employee before and after appointment regularly. Provide the
              | resources required by them to get to the management's expectations.
              |  Deliver training and development for new and experienced employees that enhances
              | critical competencies and behaviors.
              |  Create career development systems that identify, prepare, and promote employees whose
              | experience and skills match the demands of higher-level positions.
              |  Design the system which is free from biasness and favoritism because it discourages the
              | employee when it comes to appointment of employees in a long run case.
              |  Review the systems that support the on-going relationship with the employee. This
              | includes looking at the performance management system, assessing the state of your
              | compensation structures, training and development, plus looking how you handle employee
              | grievances or complaints.
              |  Company should assess how well do you inform and educate your employees on your
              | policies, procedures, and practices.
              |  Improper information should not be retained in primary personnel files.
              |  HEG should review its existing human resource policies to ensure completeness and
              | relevance to the department’s current context; ensure widespread communication and
              | understanding of human resource policies; regularly monitor compliance to human resource
              | policies; and update human resources policies on an ongoing basis.

              |  When management establishes targets in their human resource plan, management should
              | ensure that strategies are established to achieve those targets.
              |  Suitable policies and procedures to support the development and management of human
              | resources are established, maintained, and communicated.
              |  HEG should consider developing a multi-year integrated business and human resource
              | plan for the department that is adjusted annually to reflect the priorities of the current year.
              |  HEG must consider all the available options for strategically promoting job openings and
              | encouraging suitable candidates to apply.
              |  Determine the gap between where your organization wants to be in the future and where
              | you are now. The gap analysis includes identifying the number of staff and the skills and
              | abilities required in the future in comparison to the current situation.
              |  HR Planning and audit objectives can be achieved successfully when there is a link or
              | alignment between organizational and unit objectives so to avoid the conflict between team
              | and organization's objectives.
