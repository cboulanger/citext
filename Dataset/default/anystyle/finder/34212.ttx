              | Abstract
              | European political elites are faced with a loss of trust and the emergence of a growing number of sometimes
              | rather obscure new political movements. How is this to be explained? What is the relationship between the
              | logic that guides political attitudes of constituencies and the logic of political actors whose legitimacy is
              | rooted in electoral choice of the constituencies? In this essay we approach this question from a systemic
              | perspective, regarding this relationship as a problem solving feedback cycle. Classical approaches, such as
              | the median voter theorem, view political actors as passively mirroring voters’ preferences. An alternative
              | approach that we suggest, assumes that the perception of competences of political actors on the part of
              | constituencies is key in the sense that it does not only reflect voters’ preferences, but it is also manipulable
              | through the agency of political actors themselves. More generally, we argue that the perception of
              | competence is socially constructed and contextually dependent.

              | 1. Introduction
              | European democracies seem to be facing a crisis. In Greece the political system of the last 40
              | years is called into question. Loss of trust in the leaders of the party system of the last 40 years has led to
              | the emergence of new political actors that nearly entered the government. After being governed by experts
              | without democratic legitimacy, Italy seems to be lost in a permanent political crisis. Beppe Grillo’s Five
              | Stars Movement gained considerable support for a programme which is considered by many as a boycott
              | of politics in general. 2010 municipal elections in Reykjavík, Iceland, were won by the Best Party, a quasi-
              | political assemblage led by a comedian, with a political “platform” full of absurd promises such as free
              | towels in swimming pools, acquisition of a polar bear for the local Zoo, and construction of a Disneyland
              | near the city airport. A candidate at 2009 Croatian local elections gathered sizable electoral support with a
              | cynical slogan: “Everything to me, nothing to you!” Another, somewhat less successful candidate at 2011
              | Croatian parliamentary elections, based his campaign on complete avoidance of public talk, under a
              | quizzical slogan: “Silence is gold. I’ll talk in the Parliament!” (Srbljinovic, 2013). Politicians in Romania do
              | not seem to perceive political competitors as legitimate. Numerous additional examples of bizarre would-be
              | political leaders and caricatural political parties can be found in many European countries. In Eastern
              | European countries there is also a growing body of literature on loss of trust in political actors as a
              | consequence of poor performance and corruption of political actors who are not believed to serve the
              | interests of the common public (Voinea, 2012; Atanasov and Cvetanova, 2012). The first Croatian 2013
              | elections for the EU Parliament were marked by a very low turnout (around 20%) and an unusually high
              | number of invalid ballots (more than 5%), most of which were intentionally spoiled as an expression of
              | outrage at ruling political elites, both those of the ruling coalition as well as those in the opposition. It is
              | somewhat paradoxical that in case those ballots were cast for the same party, this hypothetical “Party of
              | the Disaffected” would enter the EU Parliament.
              | Where does this apparent crisis of political representation and representatives come from? Can
              | this be analysed in a systematic manner, instead of simply blaming political leaders of being morally
              | corrupted? While this moral argument might not miss the point entirely, it needs further explanation. For this
              | reason we shall try to approach this problem from different angles in a number of essays in the following
              | issues of the European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities. Our thesis is that the crisis is
              | twofold: on the side of constituencies, trust in politicians is low. On the other side, however – the side of
              | political actors – not very reliable candidates receive significant support at elections. The purpose of the
              | essays is to suggest a framework for a theoretical model of how formation of political attitudes and
              | democratic selection of political action and actors are interrelated. In this first essay we shall examine a
              | systemic perspective on the problem: in principle, democracy should enable selection of political actors
              | who would adequately represent political attitudes of the society. However, as it seems, this has not
              | operated well in the past years. We examine this problem in more abstract terms by regarding social
              | systems as problem solving systems. The classical approach to investigate the relationship between
              | political actors and political attitudes is the median voter theorem. It is suggested that this relationship can
              | be addressed by a more general notion of – perceived – competence.
              | However, structures are enacted by actors. For this reason, the following essay will concentrate on
              | the perspective of political actors: why do political entrepreneurs often seem to be “more rational” than their
              | audience - why do they often look like they “exploit” the audience for their own interests and aims, as stated
              | openly in this grotesque claim: “Everything to me, nothing to you”? To investigate this question we rely on
              | neo-Weberian sociological actor theories. Boudon’s (2001) notions of instrumental and axiological

              | rationality are introduced and put into a dynamic framework. Combined with Risse’s (2000) typology of
              | situational logic, this allows to develop a mechanism of the relation between political actors and political
              | attitudes that contributes to an explanation of the current crisis of political legitimacy in Europe.
              | In the final essay we shall integrate the systemic and the actor perspective. For this purpose we
              | develop the notion of distributed reflexivity. This allows to sketch the long-term dynamics of the mechanism
              | relating political actors and attitudes. Here we follow the research programme of deliberative democracy
              | approaches (Bohman, 1995; Benhabib, 1996; Chambers, 2003) to investigate the emergence (and possible
              | decline) of legitimacy of democratic political leadership. According to this view, democratic legitimacy arises
              | out of free and unconstrained public discourse (Benhabib, 1996). However, this approach has not been
              | uncontested. Free discourse does not guarantee that simply by the principles of discourse justice and
              | common goods are achieved, but free discourse might also lead to agonistic pluralism (Mouffe, 1999). The
              | examples of frivolous, would-be politicians demonstrate empirically that discourse might not lead to morally
              | desirable results. Thus we end with the open question of whether the current crisis indicates a process of
              | distributed reflexivity or communicative bubbles. The future will show.
              | 2. An Abstract Formulation of the Problem
              | In more abstract terms, social systems can be regarded as problem solving systems. Governments
              | provide specialised institutions in order to solve problems that concern the whole of a society (Almond et
              | al., 2006; Cioffi-Revilla, 2009).2 Sometimes they fail to do so as demonstrated, for instance, by the
              | breakdown of the Soviet system. Less dramatically, in democratic systems a government might be
              | deselected because it is perceived as insufficiently or inadequately solving societal problems. Thus, it can
              | be said that the duty of a government is to develop policies in order to solve societal problems. In
              | democratic societies the people is the sovereign of the state,3 hence the duty of the sovereign is to select
              | an appropriate problem-solving agency. Thus a self-organised feedback cycle between political attitudes
              | and political actors exists (Markisic et al., 2012).
              | Whereas politicians have the organisational capacities to set the agenda (Arnold, 1990), citizens of
              | democratic societies select one of the proposed political agendas. However, as the above examples of
              | grotesque politicians indicate, there is no guarantee that this would indeed be a problem solving feedback
              | cycle. In particular, in times of crisis and uncertainty, democratic “search mechanisms” need not reach
              | globally or locally optimal results.
              | Figure 1 provides a stylised representation of the search process that might – or might not –
              | generate solutions for problems of public concern: problem solving activities generate some state of the
              | society. For instance, reducing taxes in order to increase the economic activity changes social conditions,
              | introducing new opportunities and new problems. Elections decide over a future political agenda which
              | might be more advantageous or disadvantageous for the society. Note that a sharp distinction between
              | “stable” and “critical” pathways is only an idealisation. Actually, there might be a gradual transition between
              | 2 Theories of the evolution of social complexity (Cohen, 1985; Tuzin, 2002) emphasise that social stratification and differentiation
              | can be regarded as an evolutionary solution to the problem of population pressure.
              | 3 Although this is not literally true, various definitions of democracy imply, in one way or another, that the people is indeed the
              | ultimate sovereign (cf. Bobbio, 1987, pp. 29–54; Manin, 1995, pp. 161–192; Schumpeter, 1942, p. 269; see also Dahl’s (1956, p.
              | 84) definition of poliarchy). Authoritarian systems, on the other hand, also claim to govern in the name of the people. The key
              | difference between democratic and authoritarian systems, however, is that the people of democratic regimes is comprised of
              | individual bearers of basic and inalienable rights, while in non-democratic regimes it is the people in toto that prevails over
              | individuals (Mastropaolo, 2012, p. 14).

              | more and less efficient problem-solving activities. For instance, some decisions have to be made on how to
              | dispose of nuclear waste. The future consequences remain uncertain. However, selling the waste to other
              | states may generate new problems, whereas different problems (in different time horizons) may arise if the
              | waste is stored below the surface of the earth. In sum, some political decisions may have consequences
              | that in turn destabilise the political system or in the most extreme cases even the living conditions of the
              | people.
              | Figure 1.
              | Schematic representation of the problem solving search process
              | Since problems of public concern are defined by the constituencies whereas the agenda of political
              | actors provides possible solutions, it seems necessary to investigate the relationship between political
              | actors and political attitudes of the people in more detail. Successful politicians are those who are
              | successful in, inter alia, convincing the audience. Beside the role of the media (Habermas, 2006), this might
              | well lead to a selection pressure toward a strategic rationality of communication. These considerations
              | suggest a closer inspection of relevant theoretical foundations.
              | 3. Classical Approach to the Relation Between Political Actors and Political Attitudes: Median
              | Voter Theorem.
              | The classical approach to this question is the median voter theorem, stating that on a scale from
              | left wing to right wing political opportunities, the most successful political agenda is the one preferred by the

              | median voter (Downs, 1957). The median voter is the one who occupies the median position on the scale
              | (Figure 2). Downs has shown that in a two party system a party that best represents the median voter will
              | receive most votes (Srbljinovic, 2013). It follows that the median voter theorem predicts a tendency of
              | political parties to move toward the middle of the political attitudes’ space.
              | Figure 2.
              | Illustration of the Median Voter Theorem.
              | The Median Voter Theorem has been much explored in the past decades (Congleton, 2002).
              | Particularly in majority voting systems it has provided reasonable predictions. However, research also
              | revealed the limitations of the median voter theorem (Krehbiel, 2004). Here we emphasise that it is limited
              | to a one dimensional scale from right wing to left wing and an assumption of an unimodal distribution of
              | political attitudes. Moreover, the scale of possible agendas is predefined by the theoretical concept: an
              | agenda is denoted as either left or right (Krehbiel, 2004). This might have been a correct reflection of the
              | historical situation in the 1960s. However, since the end of the Cold War it often remains unclear how to
              | categorise a certain agenda on a scale from left to right. For instance, in multiethnic societies votes might
              | also be divided along ethnic lines (Snyder, 2000; Mann, 2005). This finding might also hold for other
              | ideologies and social value orientations. Finally, the median voter theorem assumes that voters vote
              | according to their true preferences. This is questionable in regard to the problem outlined in the
              | introduction: why do political entrepreneurs get public support for dubious agendas characterised by
              | ridiculous slogans, such as: “Everything to me, nothing to you”? Thus the median voter theorem does
              | predict a certain kind of rationality of political actors, namely that they aim to maximise votes. However, it
              | does so by assuming that this can be obtained by moving toward the middle of a pre-fixed scale of political
              | attitudes. This does not capture the main point of a problem solving search process – selection of a certain
              | kind of substantial solution to a substantial problem.

              | This limitation can be overcome with the notion of competence (Mueller 1989). The concept of
              | competence is related to the social construction of target population. Schneider and Ingram (1993) argue
              | that addressees of policy interventions are socially constructed types of subgroups of the population. These
              | types may be positive (e.g. the rich) donors or negative (e.g. minorities) receivers of state policies, and they
              | may also be powerful (strong) or powerless (weak).
              | Figure 3.
              | Schematic politicians’ representation of target population.
              | As illustrated in Figure 3, the concept of target population focuses on how politicians address
              | constituencies, e.g. targeted drug addicts have generally been construed as a weak and deviant
              | subpopulation. Similarly, Schneider and Ingram (1993) argue that a policy addressing negatively and
              | weakly constructed target populations such as criminals or drug addicts is mostly perceived as more
              | competent by the majority of the population if it is restrictive and burdensome (at least in the US). Thus “law
              | and order” policy is likely to be perceived as competent. Here we add the reverse relation of how
              | constituencies perceive political actors. We emphasise that a political elite needs to be regarded as
              | competent in order to convince a political audience of the effectiveness of the respective policy (Mueller,
              | 1989). As another example, political actors offering competence in defence activities might be regarded as
              | important by many people, while those offering competence in Voodoo activities might have problems to

              | convince a sufficient number of followers (at least in the Western world). Thus competence is related to
              | certain issues of public interest and there may be a multiplicity of competence fields.
              | Insofar as political actors need to convince the constituencies of their competence in problem
              | solving to gain legitimacy, the concept of competence follows deliberative democracy approach. Multiple
              | points of view are considered by this concept. However, it differs from this approach insofar as political
              | actors and constituencies are explicitly distinguished. This allows to take differential power of political
              | actors and constituencies into account. Thus far it is in line with the basic assumption of the median voter
              | theorem that political actors react to voters’ preferences. However, the concept of competence allows to
              | overcome the assumption of an unimodal distribution over a one-dimensional scale. For instance, a political
              | party might be perceived as highly competent with regard to economic issues but less competent with
              | regard to security issues, or domestic and cultural politics.
              | Figure 4.
              | Schematic representation of competence fields.
              | In Figure 4, the square indicates the space of political problems and the circles indicate the
              | competence of hypothetical parties in these problem fields. Note that the graph illustrates the competence
              | as perceived by a single actor. This needs to be aggregated over the population. Moreover, it is important
              | to note that competence is a constructivist concept: what is essential is perceived competence, and not
              | some “objectively” measurable indicators. For instance, it might be reasonably questioned if “law and order”
              | politics is truly effective. Nevertheless, political actors may still be perceived as competent if they advocate

              | structures need to be regarded as competent in order to gain legitimacy. Elections provide such legitimacy
              | because the results can be regarded as the evidence that the winner is perceived as the most competent
              | candidate. At least two dimensions are involved in such a “proof”: first, what kind of agenda is seen as
              | facing the most urgent societal problems (e.g. economic progress, freedom, or equality). Second, what kind
              | of agenda is perceived as the most efficient to solve these problems. However, the current crisis shows that
              | political leaders are often no longer regarded as competent to solve societal problems. Perceived
              | competence is always only relative with regard to other competitors. Presumably frivolous politicians
              | (Srbljinovic, 2013) do not gain votes because of their competence, but due to loss of trust in the
              | competence of their competitors; i.e. protest voting can be interpreted as a signal against other candidates
              | rather than in favour of the candidate voted for.
              | In this context, corruption (in the broadest sense) is an important factor. While competence is
              | normally judged as the ability to satisfy public interest, corrupt politicians are seen as serving only partial
              | interests, which implies an incentive for such politicians to frame partial interests in terms of public good.
              | Since successful political entrepreneurs are those who are successful in convincing the audience of their
              | competence, a selection pressure toward a certain kind of shrewd political communication is to be
              | expected. Thus we are faced with the question that political entrepreneurs often seem to be “more rational”
              | than their audience – entrepreneurs often look like they “exploit” the audience for their own interests and
              | aims. The trustful audience seems to be “less rational” than the entrepreneurs. And grotesque candidates
              | and their followers most often seem to be disillusioned and powerless, able to see through the ongoing
              | political farce on the one hand, but unable to change much on the other. Therefore they seem to resort to
              | bizarre devices as a means of exposing pointlessness of distorted political processes.4
              | 4. Outlook
              | In this essay we investigated the problem of relationship between political actors and political
              | attitudes of the people from the perspective of the constituencies. If, for instance, the constituencies regard
              | as the most urgent problem the question of polar bears in the local zoo, it can be assumed that either the
              | people do not have more serious problems or that no other political agenda is perceived as problem
              | solving. Indeed, the problems caused by globalisation or financial crisis are both rather novel and serious.
              | No solutions exist which have been proven successful in the past. In contrast to e.g. problems caused by
              | criminality or drugs, these problems produce a high degree of uncertainty, not only in terms of probability of
              | success of the proposed measures but also - and more seriously - in terms of what to do at all. In terms of
              | a search process, voting for polar bears can be regarded as a random walk. As it is known from complexity
              | theory this indeed is a reasonable strategy. Voting for candidates promising polar bears can also be
              | regarded as a mild, yet ingenious form of civil disobedience. And, it is well known from the theory of civil
              | society that “civil disobedience initiates a learning process that expands the range and forms of
              | participation open to private citizens within a mature political culture” (Cohen and Arato, 1992, p. 567). In
              | fact, Reykjavík’s zoo still lacks a polar bear, although the Best Party is doing a considerably serious job.
              | However, the perspective of the constituencies differs from that of political actors. What kind of
              | strategies and cognitive resources are to be expected from political actors and how are these related to
              | those of the constituencies? This will be investigated in the next essay.
              | 4 Note also that frivolous candidates can actually be welcomed by political elites since what such candidates do, in effect, is to
              | shift the focus of public attention from the more contentious fields of competence, such as economy, social justice and the like, to
              | the more innocuous competences of poking fun, making sarcastic remarks and so on.
