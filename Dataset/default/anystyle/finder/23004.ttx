              | 1 The argument also seems to be counter-intuitive on ‘contextualist’ grounds them-
              | selves. The appeal to maximizing overall outcomes complicates any justiﬁcation
              | for the special protection of minorities, because, presumably, minority interests
              | are (quantitatively) outweighed by those of the majority on any given issue.

              | A reply

              | Sex-selective abortion (SSA) is a subject that raises troubling questions
              | about multiculturalism, gender and autonomy that deﬁes a deﬁnitive
              | answer. My article was a step towards addressing this complex issue. I am
              | grateful therefore to my discussants for their thoughtful comments on my
              | article.
              | Before I respond to what I take to be their major criticisms, let me
              | correct a factual misunderstanding. The Netherlands does not have, as
              | Miriam Ticktin thinks, a policy of free access to pre-natal diagnostics
              | (PND), nor am I arguing that it should have.
              | Ticktin claims that I am taking a culturalistic perspective that would
              | prevent me from seeing what is really at stake. SSA is a practice that,
              | according to her, is shaped by state violence against and discrimination of

              | immigrant minority groups. I have no problem in acknowledging that the
              | Netherlands’ policy towards immigrant groups is harsh and that the racist
              | prejudice the Dutch display against immigrants is alarming. Yet they do not
              | constitute the cause of SSA. At the root of the problem is a cultural son
              | preference and we should be prepared to acknowledge this.
              | This sex preference is linked to the tradition of providing a daughter with
              | a dowry when she marries. In my article, I explained that, due to a process
              | of commodiﬁcation of the tradition, some families now demand very expen-
              | sive consumer goods for a dowry gift and therefore a daughter’s marriage
              | may economically ruin a family. This is an important background to this sex
              | preference. I think, therefore, that I deploy a more materialist notion of
              | culture than Ticktin thinks.
              | Monica Mookherjee believes that I leave women in the cold who are
              | pressurized into ‘choosing’ SSA, because I do not pay enough attention to the
              | social conditions under which these women make their choice. According to
              | her I herewith display a non-relational view on autonomy that sees all of us
              | as equally free to determine our lives, while Ticktin suggests that I see western
              | women as fully autonomous and the rest of us as non-autonomous victims of
              | our culture. I agree that I did not discuss at length how Asian women’s
              | autonomy can be enhanced, as my focus was on whether measures to ban
              | SSA should include restricting access to abortion. I consider both Dutch and
              | Asian women as capable of autonomy, yet both as also constrained in
              | exercising their autonomy, albeit by different social and cultural conditions.
              | Making the abortion law more restrictive does not lift these constraints.
              | Social policy may, however, and therefore this is what I see as a better way
              | to offer protection to women who are pressurized to undergo a SSA.
              | Anne Phillips’s main worry, which she shares with Monica Mookherjee,
              | is that my contextualism will end in pure pragmatism. Phillips expresses the
              | classical philosophical preference: ﬁrst we determine whether a practice is
              | morally right or wrong (the philosopher’s job), and once we know what
              | justice requires, the policymaker decides on the implementation of actual
              | policy. The actual policy-outcome may be co-determined by pragmatic
              | concerns, but these fall outside the philosophical analysis. I do not believe
              | in this neat job delineation, moreover, I think that what to do as a matter
              | of policy is a question that normally also involves moral considerations.
              | To illustrate my point let me bring forward Stephen Macedo’s discussion
              | of the Mozert and the Yoder cases. In Mozert v. Hawkins, a conﬂict over
              | public education and religious diversity, orthodox Christian parents
              | objected to the school’s mandatory basic reading program that exposed
              | their children to a variety of worldviews. The parents claimed a right to
              | exempt their children from the reading program, while remaining in the
              | public schools (Macedo, 1995: 472). Macedo decided that on principled
              | grounds the Mozert families should not be accommodated. He added to this
              | that there are also prudential reasons that might be considered – school

meta          | 281
text          | administrators might anticipate that the families would otherwise withdraw
              | their children altogether from the public school system and for that reason
              | accommodate them – but these come secondary, and he even doubted
              | whether courts should at all examine these ‘additional grounds’, as he called
              | them (1995: 487, 488). Hence, Macedo distinguished between principle-
              | based and pragmatic arguments while arguing that we should take into
              | account the former only. Yet, note that Macedo, whilst against accommo-
              | dating the Mozert parents, thought it right to accommodate the more
              | radical claim of Amish’ parents (the Yoder case) to altogether withdraw
              | their school-aged children from high school, since the Amish, because of
              | their small number, pose no threat to public order (1995: 472, 489). Hence,
              | it was ultimately a pragmatic argument about numbers (sic!) that settled for
              | Macedo whether to accommodate or not. Contextual arguments inter-
              | penetrate with principled arguments. In a contextual approach, this is
              | acknowledged and considered as inescapable. Principles are generic and as
              | such underdetermined. To make sense of them and to be able to make a
              | judgement in speciﬁc cases we need contexts.
              | This being said, I do share Phillips’s worry that there is the risk to Carens’s
              | – and as I follow his approach (Carens, 2000), also my – contextualism that
              | we end up with a kind of ‘moral casuistry’, as Seyla Benhabib so aptly phrases
              | it (2002: 125). By this she means the risk that we confuse ‘the normatively
              | right’ with ‘the institutionally feasible’ (2002: 125). The problem with
              | Carens’s contextual approach is that pragmatic arguments may co-determine
              | our moral deliberation, yet it remains unclear to what extent. I think
              | Benhabib touches the sore spot in Carens’s approach, yet I do not see a ready
              | solution. New rules of lexical priority? Which ones? Besides, they seem to
              | go against the grain of the approach. In the meantime, unsatisfactory as it
              | may seem, we have no choice but to contextually argue it out.
