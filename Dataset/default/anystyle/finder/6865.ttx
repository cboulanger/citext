              | Abstract
              | This paper examines the relationship between occupation and diﬀerent types of human
              | capital—skills, education, ability and health. Summary statistics of our panel data from the
              | Ghana Household Worker Survey strongly suggest that height and health vary by occupa-
              | tion. Our regression results show that after controlling for age, gender and movement out
              | of jobs, the self-employed are the most likely to have at least one day of illness (a health
              | shock) in the past year. However, conditional on having at least one day of illness, the
              | self-employed have the lowest expected number of days ill. On the other hand, evidence
              | that large ﬁrm workers have longer illnesses than other workers, perhaps reﬂecting their
              | better employment circumstances that allow more time oﬀ when sick, cautions against the
              | use of days of illness as a measure of health that is unbiased by occupational choice. We
              | also investigate labour market outcomes and ﬁnd that the number of days ill does not aﬀect
              | the labour supply decision. Controlling for entry into the labour force, however, days of
              | illness does have a signiﬁcant negative impact on earnings, especially if it exceeds 30 days.
              | Our analysis suggests that changes in health and changes in occupation are strongly cor-
              | related; understanding the causal links in this relationship should be the focus of future work.

text          | Introduction
              | The large increases in urban self-employment and rising numbers of microenterprises in Africa
              | raise an interesting issue: while the number of opportunities for employment may be increas-
              | ing, it is not clear how job quality in this type of employment compares with that of large
              | sector ﬁrms. The limited literature on the expansion of self-employment disagrees on this is-
              | sue. Looking at movements into and out of self-employment in Mexico, Fajnzylber, Maloney,
              | and Rojas (2006) conclude that self-employment is just as desirable as other labour market
              | alternatives. In contrast, Sandefur, Serneels, and Teal (2006) use labour market data for the
              | urban sector in Ghana, Tanzania and Ethiopia to show that incomes for the self-employed and
              | those in small ﬁrms are substantially less than those in large ﬁrms and the public sector (see
              | also S¨oderbam, Teal, and Wambugu (2005)). Thus earnings diﬀerentials imply that the quality
              | of self-employment and jobs in microenterprises might be substantially inferior compared to
              | employment in large ﬁrms.
              | Yet these ﬁndings ignore the eﬀects of health on occupational choice and earnings and the reverse
              | eﬀects of occupation and income on health. Indeed, there is evidence in the literature that health
              | shocks result in a loss in income due to reductions in labor supply and/or productivity (Gertler
              | & Gruber, 2002), and that healthier individuals earn more. In other words, our analysis will be
              | incomplete if we ignore health.
              | We therefore explore the relationships between employment status, health outcomes and wages
              | in Africa. We are particularly interested in the self-employed and use two waves from new
              | panel data from the Ghana Household Worker Survey to investigate job quality and health
              | for these individuals. The key to understanding the nature of this relationship is observing
              | the individual at diﬀerent points in time, so as to observe movements between jobs, changes
              | in income and shocks to health. Our panel data set, which is collected at the individual level
              | and contains detailed health and income information, is ideally suited to consider this problem.
              | We also incorporate data on skills and health knowledge, to see how the various aspects of
meta          | 2
text          | human capital (health, education, skills and ability) come into play. The temporal aspect of the
              | panel gives us the opportunity to investigate whether the movement out of certain jobs impacts
              | health. Whether or not these movements are caused by or are the cause of health shocks is
              | an equally interesting element of health outcomes and has obvious implications for assessing
              | job quality. Dynamic extensions of this kind, as well as exploring the role of lagged health on
              | present health, are particularly insightful.
              | In this paper we use data from an urban sample in Ghana to look directly at the eﬀect of past
              | illness and current job choice on current income, as well as the impact of past income and past
              | job status on current health. We begin by using the data to ask if job type varies along a
              | range of measures of health outcomes that can be observed in the data. As measuring health is
              | a diﬃcult undertaking, we consider two measures for which we have consistent measurements
              | across the survey years: height and inactive days due to illness or injury.
              | In our in-depth analysis, we are aware that identifying the eﬀects we are interested in is diﬃcult
              | and confounded by simultaneity and endogeneity issues. First, while health as an outcome
              | is a major dimension of job quality, there is a concern that health may aﬀect employment
              | status by determining participation in the labour force (see Currie and Madrian (1999) for a
              | review). In addition, it is also plausible for health to inﬂuence preferences for job type, so that
              | unhealthy individuals favour jobs in which lower productivity is required. This may be more of
              | a factor among the poorest individuals. Indeed, nutrition-based eﬃciency wage models imply
              | that the sickest individuals will be left out of the formal sector. Theory and empirical evidence
              | both suggest that nutrition, through its impact on overall health, strength, and endurance, is
              | an important determinant of worker productivity (Strauss, 1986; Deolalikar, 1988; Thomas &
              | Strauss, 1997). There are also potential feedback eﬀects because productivity increases income,
              | which in turn can be reinvested in health by buying more inputs or higher-quality inputs (Strauss
              | & Thomas, 1998).
              | We attempt to establish causality and address these issues of simultaneity by combining the
              | individual data with data at the household level. More importantly, observing past changes
meta          | 3
text          | in health and income allows us to control for past unobservables and avoid the problem of
              | simultaneous feedback eﬀects. We show that past health shocks decrease current income, and
              | that skills matter both for health and income. The evidence shows that the self-employed may
              | be worse oﬀ in terms of health outcomes, as they have a higher likelihood of falling ill. Job
              | movements, especially those out of self-employment and large ﬁrms, do play a role in the health
              | story, although the direction of causality is as of yet unclear. Conversely, income has a complex
              | relationship with health, in that people who earn more are more likely to report an illness, but
              | also experience shorter illnesses conditional on having any days ill. This supports the idea that
              | those with better jobs and higher incomes can aﬀord to be ill.
              | This paper proceeds in ﬁve sections. Section 2 oﬀers a brief review of the literature. Section 3
              | sets out our theoretical framework and empirical strategy, and Section 4 oﬀers relevant details
              | about the data. Results are presented in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes with ideas for
              | further research.

text          | Empirical Evidence
              | Dealing with the complicated interdependent relationships between health, wages, and labour
              | supply is a challenge (see Strauss and Thomas (1998) for a very comprehensive review). In
              | general, the consensus is that better health raises labour participation and wages, and that
              | health shocks lower income and consumption.
              | 2.1
              | Developed countries
              | Labour economists who look at health issues have been most interested in the eﬀects of health on
              | wages. Research on data from developed countries is more common that research on developing
              | countries. Due to the rarity of panel data, most have focused primarily on the causal pathways
              | between current health and current income and the endogeneity problems that arise with this
              | approach (Lee, 1982; Ettner, 1996). Relatively little research has been able to exploit inter-
              | temporal changes in health and income, although a limited number of studies have contributed
meta          | 4
text          | to this area.
              | Haveman, Wolfe, Kreider, and Stone (1994) use a 3-equation structural model and panel data
              | on American white men. The three equations describe health, hours worked (labour supply),
              | and wages. Health here is measured on a zero to three scale indicating the degree to which a
              | medical condition limits one’s ability to work. The authors conclude that prior (lagged) poor
              | health lowers wages and work time.
              | In an approach similar to our own, Smith (2003) investigates the impact on past health changes
              | and changes in socio-economic indicators, like income, on today’s health. He also looks at the
              | impact of health changes (shocks) on current income and labour supply. Unfortunately, he is
              | only about to look at household income, rather than individual income, but ﬁnds that health
              | shocks have a sharp negative eﬀect on income, operating mainly through labour supply and not
              | through medical expenses.
              | 2.2
              | Developing Countries
              | Much of the work on developing countries focuses either on the simultaneous relationship be-
              | tween health and earnings (Thomas & Strauss, 1997; Schultz, 2003; Schultz & Tansel, 1997;
              | Savedoﬀ & Schultz, 2000), or the eﬀect of health shocks on consumption (Wagstaﬀ, 2006; Dercon
              | & Hoddinott, 2003; Pitt & Rosenzweig, 1986). The existing literature that uses panel data to
              | examine health shocks and income shocks has been somewhat limited. In addition, as income is
              | most often measured at the household level, determining the true eﬀects of health on individual
              | income has been diﬃcult. We believe that our ability to measure income at the individual level
              | will give us a much better picture of the true eﬀect of a health shock on labour outcomes.
              | Gertler and Gruber (2002) use a panel data set from Indonesia, which allows them to look at
              | the eﬀect of major health shocks on changes (ﬁrst diﬀerences) in labour supply, income and
              | medical expenses, and the resulting ability of households to smooth consumption. Their health
              | measure is the individual’s ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Their results
              | show that larger health shocks result in larger income losses, but they do not model a recursive
meta          | 5
text          | health equation in addition their labour outcomes equation.
              | Lindelow and Wagstaﬀ (2005) use a similar ﬁrst diﬀerences approach with Chinese data and
              | ﬁnd that illness results in large declines in labour supply and income. However, the income
              | data was measured only at the household level and then calculated on a per capita basis.

text          | Theoretical Framework
              | The theoretical model developed by Grossman (1972) views health as an endogenously deter-
              | mined capital stock. Grossman’s premise is that health capital diﬀers from other forms of human
              | capital because the stock of health “determines the total amount of time [one] can spend pro-
              | ducing money earnings and commodities” (Grossman, 1972, p. 224). The model predicts that
              | health should be positively correlated with wages, for better health will increase productivity
              | and thus wages, and higher wages will increase the demand for health and medical care.
              | Let us think, as Grossman does, of health outcomes as a function of several inputs. An adult
              | individual produces health H, which is determined by various factors:
              | Ht = H(Ht−1, It−1, wt−1, Bt, D(t,h), U, e(t,h))
              | (1)
              | where It−1 is a vector of health inputs, wt−1 is prior wage (in logs), B is a vector of family
              | background characteristics, and D(t,h) is a vector of community level variables aﬀecting health.
              | The underlying time-invariant “healthiness” of the individual, U , is unobservable but known by
              | the individual, while e(t,h) is the component that is both unknown and unobservable to all, e.g.
              | measurement error.
              | Meanwhile, there exists a relationship that relates the log of real wages w in period t to several
              | inputs (Mincer, 1974):
              | wt = w(wt−1, Ht−1, Et, Bt, D(t,w), A, e(t,w))
              | (2)
              | where Et is education and Dt,w are community level infrastructure variables. Unobservable
              | time-invariant qualities known to the individual like ability are included in A; e(t,w) captures
meta          | 6
text          | measurement error and random ﬂuctuations in wt.
              | 3.1
              | Empirical Model
              | From the framework above, we develop two approaches. First, we look at health and income in
              | a setting without a lag of the dependent variable, for which the model to be estimated can be
              | thought of as:
              | Hi,t = α0 + α1Xi,t + α2Ji,t−1 + ui,1t
              | wi,t = β0 + β1Hi,t−1 + β2Xi,t + β3Ji,t + ui,2t
              | where Xt is a vector of time-varying and time-invariant individual characteristics, and Jt and
              | Jt−1 are vectors of job characteristics. We measure Ht as the inactive days in the past year
              | caused by illness or injury.
              | We extend this model to incorporate dynamics of the dependent variable, creating structural
              | equations that relate health and income in the following way:
              | Hi,t = α0 + α1Hi,t−1 + α2wi,t−1 + α3Xi,t + α4Ji,t−1 + ηi + ui,1t
              | wi,t = β0 + β1Hi,t−1 + β2wi,t−1 + β3Xi,t + β4Ji,t + ηi + ui,2t
              | Because we are dealing with panel data, this kind of model brings up some serious endogeneity
              | issues, as Hi,t−1 and wi,t−1 will be correlated with the individual eﬀects ηi. We are able to
              | deal with this for the wage equation, by instrumenting wi,t−1 with wi,t−2, available from the
              | 2004 wave of the survey. However, we have not yet found a suitable instrument for Hi,t−1;
              | nevertheless, by comparing the static and dynamic results, it is strong evidence that the bias
              | resulting from this source of endogeneity in the health equation may not be a big concern.
              | We also use a selection equation to account for labour participation, as the wage in Equations 4
              | and 6 is only observed if one enters the labour force. This stage is identiﬁed with three variables:
              | number of children, a dummy for being married or not, and a dummy indicating one’s status
              | as the household head.

              | Our identiﬁcation strategy is dependent on the ability of height to capture one’s history of health
              | and nutrition inputs, so that we can successfully use height as a control for long-term health
              | that may or may not impact the short-term measure of inactive days.1 The main advantage of
              | this speciﬁcation is that it allows us to see the eﬀect of a prior health shock on today’s income,
              | while controlling for other confounding factors, and without worrying about the endogeneity
              | introduced by the contemporaneous feedback of current income onto current health.2

text          | Data
              | The data are from the 2005 and 2006 waves of the Ghana Household Worker Survey (GHWS)
              | conducted by the Centre for African Studies (CSAE). The survey is a representative sample
              | of adult workers in urban areas in Ghana (Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi, and Cape Coast). The
              | number of individuals in this 2005-2006 panel is 1,073, from which 200 were dropped from our
              | sample due to missing values, because they were students, or because they were younger than
              | 15 or older than 60, leaving us with 873 individuals. Table 4 presents simple summary statistics
              | for this sample.
              | Great care has been taken in the design of the GHWS to measure incomes for workers in both
              | the formal and non-formal sectors. In particular, the information collected on the self-employed
              | is very detailed and, in contrast to many other surveys, allows for much more accuracy when
              | determining earnings. This unique aspect of the GHWS means that we have individual level
              | earnings information for employees in all types of employment.
              | 4.1
              | Skills
              | The 2006 wave of the GHWS includes data from four skills tests and a health knowledge test.
              | The skills tests include a Raven’s test, an English test, a mathematics test, and a reading test.
              | 1There is some evidence in very recent literature regarding the endogeneity of height with respect to earnings
              | (Schultz, 2002); however, we assume here that height is predetermined, as is common practice.
              | 2The endogeneity of the education variable in the earnings equation, due to omitted variables like ability and
              | school quality, has been well discussed in the labour economics literature. We do not instrument for education
              | in this paper, as it is not the focus of the analysis; however, previous work on the same data has concluded that
              | instrumenting education does not alter its eﬀects on earnings (Sandefur et al., 2006).

text          | Both the mathematics and reading tests have two sections (elementary and more advanced),
              | which are weighted accordingly in the scoring. The health knowledge test is comprehensive,
              | covering such topics as sources, signs and home treatments for common ailments like diarrhea
              | and heat stroke, as well as a few speciﬁc items like polio, malaria, and nutrition.
              | Although these tests allow for admittedly crude assessments of one’s true skills, they are
              | much more informative than simple subjective questions regarding literacy and numeracy. The
              | Raven’s test is interesting in itself, as it tries to ascertain one’s natural intelligence, irrespec-
              | tive of schooling. Having access to such rich data about dimensions of human capital is rare,
              | rendering our results unique and new.
              | Looking at some summary statistics on skills in Table 1, there are clearly strong diﬀerences
              | in worker characteristics across occupations. This suggests that there is a strong selection
              | mechanism of highly skilled workers into good jobs, although some of this is undoubtedly driven
              | by age and gender. In addition, we cannot rule out the reverse possibility that some of these
              | skills are acquired or improved in some occupational settings and not in others. What is most
              | impressive in this table, however, is that those who do not earn any income are actually “more
              | skilled” than the average person in the sample in almost everything except health knowledge. In
              | fact, they are more skilled on average than those in the work force as well. This ﬁnding supports
              | the claim that high-skilled workers who are unemployed do not enter self-employment during
              | their unemployment spell but prefer to keep searching for a good formal sector job.

              | The Health Variables
              | The health measures that we will focus on are height and the number of days in the past
              | year that one has been unable to do one’s normal activity. These variables both suﬀer from
              | measurement error. For height, however, only 1.6% of the measurements seemed to be obviously
              | mis-measured and were treated as missing, and we were able to use data from the 2004 wave
              | of the panel to ﬁll in some missing height values. Furthermore, in the sample that we use for
              | the results in this paper, characteristics such as gender, age and years of education do not have
meta          | 9
text          | predictive power over whether a height measurement is grossly mis-measured or whether it is
              | missing. Therefore, we do not expect the measurement error in the height variable to cause
              | signiﬁcant endogeneity issues.
              | In the case of days of illness reported, measurement error is probably present, as is the possibility
              | that more educated and wealthier people may be more likely to report illness (Schultz & Tansel,
              | 1997), and labour supply decisions may be endogenous to this variable as people try to justify
              | leaving employment due to health reasons. Another potential problem with our days of illness
              | variable is that the 2005 survey and 2006 survey were not identical in the way in which these
              | questions were asked. In 2005, respondents were asked for the number of days ill in the past
              | three months, whereas in 2006, respondents’ frame of reference was a year. Therefore, to match
              | the 2006 year-long framework, the 2005 days ill variable has been adjusted.3 In addition, the
              | 2006 survey asked for the number episodes of illness experienced during the past year (up to
              | a maximum of three episodes), and the corresponding number of days ill suﬀered during each
              | episode. From this information, we construct an aggregated number of days ill across these
              | three episodes. Information about days ill is unavailable for any additional episodes, although
              | only about 1% of the sample reports having more than three episodes, so we do not think this
              | has resulted in a downward bias in the days ill measure.
              | Some summary statistics regarding occupation and health status are helpful. For the whole
              | sample, 32% reported at least one day of illness in the last year. Table 2 breaks down days
              | of illness in the past year by wave of the survey, gender, and occupation. It is not altogether
              | clear yet from this table what the relationship between occupation and illness is. Women tend
              | to suﬀer more disabled days than men. Workers in small ﬁrms report less illness than others,
              | perhaps because their job stability is relatively precarious. The unemployed and self-employed
              | 3It is possible to simply multiply the 2005 measure by four. This makes the strong assumption that health
              | over the past three months is representative of health over the past year. Instead, we took information about
              | health over the last year provided in 2005, in which a person noted his/her frequency of illness, which determined
              | the factor by which the 2005 days of illness measure was multiplied. For example, someone with 20 days of illness
              | in the last three months, but who also reported being ill “almost all of the time” was then deemed to have 80
              | days of illness in the past year. In any case, this adjustment, as compared with simply multiplying all of the 2005
              | measurements by four, did not change the results or our conclusions in any signiﬁcant way. It simply allowed for
              | a smoother empirical distribution and hopefully better estimation.

              | It is also quite interesting to look at the distribution of height by occupation, shown in Figure

              | Results
              | Eﬀects for Health
              | To examine the health-occupation relationship, we ﬁrst consider the simple model without the
              | complications caused by including a lagged measure of health. Focusing, for the moment, on
              | days of illness as the dependent variable: we have several possible empirical strategies to deal
              | with this type of variable since it is has a high proportion of zeros, a very long tail, and is a
              | count. We chose to focus on a probit model, in which the dependent variable takes the value of
              | one if an individual reported one or more days of illness, but we also oﬀer OLS estimates and
              | a count regression conditional on at least one day of illness.4
              | Estimates from the probit model are found in Table 6 (Table 3 oﬀers variable deﬁnitions). There
              | are several things to note from this table, although we can start with the basics. Males are less
              | likely to suﬀer illness, but this eﬀect is not signiﬁcant. Age on its own has a positive impact on
              | the probability of having an illness, and its relationship is convex, so age has increasing marginal
              | eﬀects. Surprisingly, education has nothing to do with illness here. Height is also insigniﬁcant,
              | suggesting that these short-term illnesses observed in this limited time-frame are pure shocks
              | and have little to do with underlying “healthiness”.
              | In addition, the NHIS variable, a community-level measurement of the proportion of people
              | reporting that they have registered to receive one of the new National Health Insurance Scheme
              | (NHIS) cards, is worth noting. It is signiﬁcant, and controlling for all other variables at their
              | means, a one percent increase in one’s community’s take-up rate decreases one’s probability of
              | 4We also estimated a tobit model, which conﬁrmed the results reported here. Those results are available upon
              | request.
meta          | 11
text          | falling ill by just under one percent.
              | In columns 1 to 3, we see that previous occupational choice does not seem to have a signiﬁcant
              | impact on becoming sick, except for those in big ﬁrms, who have a higher likelihood of falling
              | ill. (The reference group here are those who earned no income last year.) This is most likely
              | a result of the fact that workers in big ﬁrms ‘can aﬀord to be ill.’ Moreover, the relationship
              | between lagged occupation and the actual number of days ill is rather large, as can be seen in
              | the OLS estimates in Table 7 and in the NegBin results in Table 8. These two tables coincide
              | with what the summary statistics suggested, that those who are unemployed in the past year
              | experience many more days of illness on average than others.
              | Finding that large ﬁrm workers may have more days of illness is consistent with the fact that
              | employment circumstances for workers in big ﬁrms tend to be much better. On the other
              | hand, it does suggest that days of illness may not be the best measure of health with which to
              | investigate occupational eﬀects. While we are trying to assess job quality, it may be job quality
              | itself which is driving some of the variation in days of illness; in the future, we will need to look
              | at more health measures in order to know how strong this phenomenon is.
              | After controlling for movement out of employment types, we are able to identify a much stronger
              | eﬀect of self-employment (refer to columns 4-7, Table 6). Now, the self-employed have the
              | highest probability of falling ill, relative to all other categories. However, those who get out of
              | self-employment do just as well as the others; the null hypothesis of whether the coeﬃcients
              | on “self-empl. last year” and “left self-empl.” sum to zero is accepted, so we have isolated
              | a positive relationship between self-employment and the probability of getting sick. whereas
              | leaving a large ﬁrm is associated with a big rise. We cannot be sure of the direction of causality
              | here—people may leave jobs because of health reasons, or health may alter job choice decisions—
              | so interpretation is diﬃcult. Nonetheless, it is a very interesting ﬁnding that the pattern of job
              | choice is key to understanding how occupation and health interact.
              | The skills results are a little more diﬃcult to interpret. Columns 5 and 6 show the addition of
meta          | 12
text          | the skills variables. Innate ability, indicated by the Raven score, is linked to a higher probability
              | of illness: scoring ten percent higher on the Raven’s test raises the probability by roughly ﬁve
              | percent; the result for reading ability is similar. In contrast, English skills have a downward
              | eﬀect on the probability of illness.
              | We also show the results for including health knowledge and then instrumenting it with parental
              | education and number of children in columns 6 and 7, respectively.5 It is obvious from these
              | results that health knowledge is indeed highly endogenous to health, i.e. the more unhealthy
              | one is, the more knowledge one acquires. Once instrumented, health knowledge and probability
              | of illness are negatively related, which makes more sense intuitively—presumably the more one
              | knows about health, the more one can prevent illness.
              | Moving on from the binary restriction imposed by the probit, we turn brieﬂy to a zero-truncated
              | negative binomial model of days ill (Table 8). The dependent variable is number of days ill,
              | for individuals with at least one day. The estimation precision may suﬀer from the low number
              | of observations, but the regression is nonetheless an interesting addition to the information
              | provided by the probit. Being male reduces the expected count by 34%. Those without earned
              | income in the last year have much more days of illness than the self-employed and those in
              | small ﬁrms. In fact, the self-employed have the lowest number of days of illness. This could
              | be because they are actually healthier and thus have more minor illnesses. But combining this
              | with our evidence from the probit, the results support the alternative argument that the self-
              | employed’s work circumstances are inferior to those of market sector workers: not only do the
              | get sick with the highest probability, but they then stay sick for the shortest amount of time,
              | presumably because they have to return to work.
              | Employment in a big ﬁrm is associated with a more than doubling of inactive days, which is
              | again some evidence that those whose job security is less tenuous may enjoy more time for
              | convalescence. Similar to the probit model, job movement seems to be important, although
              | 5We use a control function approach here, regressing health knowledge on the exogenous regressors; the results
              | of this ﬁrst stage can be found in Table 5.
meta          | 13
text          | more so for those moving out of large ﬁrms and those moving into the labour force or out of
              | self-employment.
              | The skills estimates are all signiﬁcant. For those who are sick, it seems that intelligence and
              | numeracy help you to get well, whereas English knowledge and literacy are linked to longer
              | spells of illness. It is unclear at this point what exactly this means.
              | 5.2
              | Eﬀects for Earnings
              | Let us now look at the selection equation for earned income (Table 9), the ﬁrst stage of our
              | earnings analysis. The variables that identify this selection are number of children, a dummy
              | for married, and a dummy for household head.
              | Gender is not a signiﬁcant determinant of earning an income. That men and women have similar
              | employment rates may be a bit surprising, but this is probably because women are more likely
              | to be self-employed, and our binary earned income variable does not pick up on this nuance.
              | Some may also question why the Raven score variable is negative, and the rest of the skills and
              | education are insigniﬁcant. One would expect those who do not earn income to be on average,
              | less educated and less able. The answer may have something to do with signalling and worker
              | quality. It is likely that high quality workers stay out of the labour force, waiting for a good
              | job to come along, and do not seek self-employment in the interim because they fear it would
              | send a negative signal to potential (good) employers. Therefore, many of those without income
              | may in fact be more qualiﬁed than not.
              | As for the health factors, neither height nor the health shock (days ill last year) are important.
              | Although a past illness enters negatively, therefore decreasing the probability of having earned
              | income, it is statistically insigniﬁcant.6
              | Now, we can turn to the earnings equations in Table 10. The table shows the results of regressing
              | the log of monthly wages on several explanatory variables. Columns 1 through 4 are estimates
              | 6A possible extension, that is beyond the scope of this paper, is to investigate further the fact that height
              | does clearly have something to do with occupation through a multinomial logit selection equation.
meta          | 14
text          | without controlling for selection, and Columns 5-8 include an inverse Mills ratio (‘heckman’)
              | from the probit for earned income (the full model from Column 4, Table 9). The ﬁrst column
              | oﬀers a standard speciﬁcation, in which hours, gender, age, education, and occupation all aﬀect
              | earnings signiﬁcantly. Here, it is clear that men earn more than women, and that age, which
              | may also pick up experience, raises earnings but at a decreasing rate. Employees in small ﬁrms
              | earn signiﬁcantly less than the self-employed, and they both earn much less than others in large
              | ﬁrms and the public sector. When skills are added, the overall picture remains the same. And
              | although the skills variables take away some of the education eﬀect, they certainly do not wipe
              | it out, which means that the skills are picking up characteristics that are not measured with
              | years of schooling.
              | A previous illness, or health shock, has a negative impact on wages, but height does not play
              | any role. This suggests that short-term shocks may aﬀect income but long-term health does
              | not. Moreover, if health is controlling for the unobservables associated with health, then this is
              | a very strong result indeed. It must be acknowledged that outliers have a strong eﬀect, and this
              | eﬀect loses its statistical signiﬁcance if we take out those people who experienced more than 14
              | days of illness last year. Even so, it is clear that for some people, who have serious illnesses,
              | these do have a downward impact on earnings.
              | After controlling for selection, the health shock is still signiﬁcant (column 7), but we lose our
              | ability to identify this eﬀect precisely when we put the whole model together by adding in
              | skills (column 8). Ability, measured by the Raven’s score, enters strongly here and increases
              | earnings.
              | 5.3
              | Dynamic Eﬀects for Health
              | Let us now consider a dynamic setting, in which lagged health is included as a determinant of
              | current health, and lagged earnings is included in the earnings equation. This autoregressive
              | model brings up new econometric issues, which have yet to be fully addressed by the authors.
              | However, we include them here because they are an integral part of understanding the inter-
meta          | 15
text          | temporal nature of the health-income relationship.
              | The estimates for the dynamic probit model are presented in Table 11. It is easy to verify that
              | the point estimates, compared with Table 6, are nearly identical, which may be good evidence
              | that the lagged health variable does not introduce too much bias, although we cannot rule out
              | this possibility. As the results are so similar, we will limit our discussion here to the lagged
              | days ill variable, which is positive and signiﬁcant. An 10-day increase in illness suﬀered in the
              | previous year translates into a 7% greater chance of falling ill this year.
              | Again, it is possible that this eﬀect is being driven by outliers, and if we aggressively restrict
              | the sample to people without long illness spells, the eﬀect’s statistical signiﬁcance diminishes.
              | Using a dummy to indicate an illness in the previous year is also statistically insigniﬁcant for
              | the whole sample. If we instead use a dummy that indicates a long sickness (over 1 month) in
              | the previous year, the point estimates of the other variables are essentially unchanged, while
              | the dummy for a big health shock is statistically signiﬁcant and shows that having a severe
              | illness last year increases the chances of falling ill this year by over 50%. This is important
              | evidence of the persistence of illness, especially for those who experience a somewhat severe
              | health shock.
              | 5.3.1
              | Earnings or Occupation?
              | This occupational eﬀect on illness that we have uncovered by including dummies for job move-
              | ment may have more to do with income variations across occupation than the occupation itself.
              | In order to investigate this question, we need to limit the sample size to those for whom we
              | have observed earned income. These results are presented in Table 12.
              | If we narrow our sample accordingly and control for the level of lagged income, it is true that
              | the lagged occupation eﬀects lose their statistical signiﬁcance in the probit model for having
              | any illness—income, for which the coeﬃcient is signiﬁcant, overrides the occupational diﬀer-
              | ences. However, the dummy for leaving self-employment is still negative and weakly signiﬁcant,
              | although we have trouble identifying it when the skills are added to the model. The eﬀect of
meta          | 16
text          | the income level is positive, so that higher income is associated with a higher probability of any
              | sickness. Again, this may be because those with higher incomes can aﬀord to be ill. When we
              | run a count regression but control for the level of income, the coeﬃcient on income is negative
              | but insigniﬁcant. Nevertheless, even if some of the occupational eﬀect on health is working
              | through earnings, it does not take away from the fact that workers in diﬀerent occupations
              | experience diﬀerent health outcomes.
              | 5.4
              | Dynamic Eﬀects for Earnings
              | To examine the dynamic relationship in the earnings equation, we must limit the sample to
              | those people for whom we observe earned income in both 2005 and 2006. Estimates are oﬀered
              | in Table 14 (refer to Table 13 for the relevant comparison of the same sample but without the
              | log of last year’s wage).
              | It is immediately clear that the previous year’s log wage dominates almost all of the other
              | explanatory variables. Earnings is clearly a persistent process, and last year’s earnings is a
              | strong, signiﬁcant determinant of earnings today. Column 9-IV is an instrumental variables
              | model which instruments the lag of log wage with an individual’s log wage from 2004 to try to
              | purge some of the bias inherent to the dynamic linear panel model.7 This raises the estimate,
              | but does not change the conclusions. Interestingly, last year’s days of illness variable is still
              | signiﬁcant, despite the power of lagged wages. This is a key result and implies that the eﬀect
              | of a health shock is potentially very strong. Given our earned income probit ﬁndings, we
              | conclude that health shocks impact directly on earnings rather than indirectly through labour
              | participation.

text          | deﬁnitely play a role in short-term health, but they are not as important for earnings. Education
              | is not a signiﬁcant player, nor is health knowledge. Looking closer at the education-health

              | whether health operates indirectly through education is an interesting question but is beyond

              | We also investigate the possibility of a virtuous or vicious cycle by which good (poor) health
              | leads to improved (lower) incomes which leads to improved (poorer) health. We present evidence
              | that occupational status, job movements and health are linked. Health shocks do not aﬀect the
              | choice between working and not working, and that illness, at least for some who experience
              | serious health shocks, is persistent over time. Health shocks do have a negative eﬀect on
              | earnings, especially for those who have recently been severely ill.
              | Overall, the question of whether higher incomes in large ﬁrms translate into better health is
              | highly relevant for policy, as we decide whether promotion of microenterprises is truly a pro-poor
              | strategy along non-income dimensions of welfare. We ﬁnd some evidence that self-employment
              | may cause bad health, but we do not reach the same conclusion for workers in small ﬁrms.
              | Furthermore, our results suggest that job movement and health are intimately related. This
              | relationship should be explored more in future research.
              | Further research into the destination as well as the source of occupational change would be
              | extremely helpful. Using our data, it would be possible to link occupational changes to changes
              | in income, from which we can get a better understanding of why people move jobs, assuming
              | that income jumps indicate a choice to move jobs, and income declines indicate being forced
              | out of a job. This is left as a subject for future work.
