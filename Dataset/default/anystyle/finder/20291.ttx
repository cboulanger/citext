              | Abstract The aims of this study were, ﬁrstly, to study the
              | association between parents’ and teachers’ ratings for the
              | Finnish version of the Autism Spectrum Screening Ques-
              | tionnaire (ASSQ), secondly, to ﬁnd out whether the original
              | cut-off scores of the ASSQ identify primary school-aged
              | children with Asperger syndrome (AS) or autism by using
              | the Finnish ASSQ, and thirdly, to evaluate the validity of
              | the ASSQ. Parents and/or teachers of higher-functioning
              | (full-scale intelligence quotient C 50) 8-year-old total
              | population school children (n = 4,408) and 7–12-year-old
              | outpatients with AS/autism (n = 47) completed the Finnish
              | version of the ASSQ. Agreement between informants was
              | slight. In the whole total population, low positive correla-
              | tion was found between parents’ and teachers’ ratings,
              | while in the sample of high-scoring children the correlation
              | turned out to be negative. A cut-off of 30 for parents’ and
              | teacher’s summed score and 22 for teachers’ single score is
              | recommended. A valid cut-off for parents’ single score
              | could not been estimated. The clinicians are reminded that
              | the ASSQ is a screening instrument, not a diagnosing
              | instrument. The importance of using both parents’ and
              | teachers’ ratings for screening in clinical settings is
              | underlined.

text          | Introduction
              | According to a study by Howlin and Asgharian [11], parents
              | of children with autism were generally aware of develop-
              | mental problems by 18 months of age, and parents of
              | children with Asperger syndrome (AS) at around 30 months
              | of age, while the average age of conﬁrmed diagnoses was
              | around 5.5 years in the autism group and 11 years in the AS
              | group. The diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
              | thus seemed to be assigned much later than the time when
              | parents notice developmental deviances in their child. In
              | order to help to identify ASDs, a number of screening
              | instruments have been developed, many of them for more
              | severely handicapped children with autism [e.g. 4, 5, 13] or
              | for children with ASD at all intelligence levels [e.g. 7, 8,
              | 21]. Additionally, some screening instruments have been
              | developed and validated precisely for higher-functioning
              | phenotypes [e.g. 9, 10, 22, 27].
              | The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ)
              | [10] was the ﬁrst screening instrument developed precisely
              | for AS. Initially it was known as the Asperger Syndrome
              | Screening Questionnaire. The rationale for evaluation of the
              | ASSQ in AS and other ASDs in higher-functioning children
              | was the fact that there is a clear overlap of symptoms at
              | behavioural level, reﬂected in the International Classiﬁca-
              | tion of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (ICD-10, WHO)
              | [28] and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
              | orders (DSM-IV, APA) [2] criteria for ASDs. Originally
              | designed in Sweden in Swedish, the questionnaire was
              | developed speciﬁcally for teacher screening in children
              | aged 7–16 years with normal intelligence or mild mental
              | retardation. However, the Swedish cut-off scores were
              | determined later for both parents’ and teachers’ ratings
              | [9, 10]. The ASSQ has been used in clinical settings in
              | Finland since the 1990s and it has also been translated into
              | other languages (English [10], Lithuanian [15], Norwegian
              | [19]). No other validated screening instrument especially
              | for AS was available when the ASSQ was imported from
              | Sweden to Finland.
              | In reports on child psychiatric symptoms, agreement
              | between parents’ and teachers’ ratings is generally low to
              | moderate [1, 14]. Agreement between informants has been
              | studied not only in general child psychiatric symptoms, but
              | also in autistic features [19, 24]. Szatmari et al. [24]
              | reported slight agreement between parents’ and teachers’
              | ratings (r = 0.17) in the Autism Behavior Checklist
              | (ABC; [13]) when assessing children with pervasive
              | developmental disorders (PDD). The results were sug-
              | gested to be partly explained by real differences in
              | behaviour at school and at home. In turn, Posserud et al.
              | [19] reported low-to-moderate agreement between parents
              | and teachers when assessing autistic features in a total
              | population of 7–9-year-old children by using the ASSQ. As
meta          | 123
text          | Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2009) 18:499–509
              | a consequence of low-to-moderate agreement, it is well
              | grounded to assume that the number of informants—a
              | multi-informant versus a single-informant approach—may
              | inﬂuence diagnostics [9, 15, 18, 23]. Because of large
              | differences across informants, the need to gather informa-
              | tion from both families and schools when screening for
              | ASDs was also suggested by Posserud et al. [19].
              | The purpose of our study was threefold: ﬁrst, to study
              | the association between parents’ and teachers’ ratings on
              | the Finnish version of the ASSQ, second, to ﬁnd out
              | whether the original cut-off scores recommended by Ehlers
              | et al. [10] are able to identify Finnish higher-functioning
              | [full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) C 50] primary
              | school-aged children with AS or autism and whether using
              | multi-informant ratings could increase the value of the
              | ASSQ as a screening instrument, and third, to evaluate the
              | sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive predictive value (PPV),
              | negative predictive value (NPV), likelihood ratio (LR),
              | per cent agreement (% agreement) and kappa on the
              | Finnish ASSQ.
              | Methods
              | Participants
              | The participants of this study were drawn from two ongoing
              | studies concerning higher-functioning (FSIQ C 50) chil-
              | dren with AS or autism: (1) the ‘‘total population study’’
              | [18], consisting of 4,408 children (FSIQ C 50) and (2) the
              | ‘‘outpatient study’’ of high-functioning (FSIQ C 80) out-
              | patient children with AS/autism, consisting of 34 children.
              | The participants were then divided into three partly over-
              | lapping groups: (1) ‘‘total population group’’: 4,408 eight-
              | year-old children (mean age 8.3, range 7.8–8.8) from the
              | ‘‘total population study’’ including 13 outpatients with ASD
              | (FSIQ C 50), (2) ‘‘validation sample’’: 104 eight-year-old
              | children (mean age 8.3, range 7.8–8.8) from the ‘‘total
              | population study’’ including the 13 outpatients mentioned
              | above with ASD (FSIQ C 50) and (3) ‘‘outpatient group’’:
              | 47 outpatient children aged 7–12 (mean age 9.7, range
              | 7.7–12.2) with ASD (FSIQ C 50) from Oulu University
              | Hospital (n = 43) or at Tahkokangas Service Centre in
              | Oulu (i.e. a rehabilitation centre for mentally handicapped,
              | n = 4) including the above-mentioned 13 outpatients with
              | ASD from the ‘‘total population study’’.
              | In Finland, compulsory education offers equal educa-
              | tional possibilities for every child aged 7–16 years. From
              | the age of 7 to the age of 12, children attend primary
              | school, and from 13 to 16 years they attend secondary
              | school. All children undergo developmental examinations
              | in children’s health care centres several times before school
              | age. If any developmental deviances are found or mental
              | Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2009) 18:499–509
              | retardation is suspected, the child is referred to more
              | detailed investigations and school readiness examinations
              | also including the determination of IQ. Parents thus get to
              | know the cognitive level of their child. If mental retarda-
              | tion is assigned, the child is referred to prolonged com-
              | pulsory education and further service (at Tahkokangas
              | Service Centre in the Oulu University Hospital area).
              | Registered ASD diagnoses
              | Of the 47 ASD outpatients in this study, 32 had the reg-
              | istered diagnosis of AS, 3 had infantile autism with mild
              | mental retardation, whereas 11 had ‘‘AS traits’’ and 1 had
              | ‘‘autistic traits’’ with mild mental retardation in the records
              | of the Oulu University Hospital and/or Tahkokangas Ser-
              | vice Centre. AS and AS traits diagnoses had been assigned
              | based on the ICD-10 criteria regarding current behaviour.
              | Thus, a differential diagnosis between AS and high-func-
              | tioning autism (HFA) had not been made. The diagnosis
              | ‘‘AS traits’’ refers to the features of AS, and ‘‘autistic
              | traits’’ to the features of autism.
              | Procedure
              | The studies were approved by the ethical committee of
              | Oulu University Hospital. The school inspector, the
              | superintendents of all 43 municipalities and all 329 school
meta          | 501
text          | principals were informed and permission was asked to
              | carry out the screening phase of the ‘‘total population
              | study’’. Written informed consent was obtained from par-
              | ents and from children aged 12–13 years.
              | Total population study
              | Screening phase of the study
              | The ‘‘total population study’’ started in September 2000 in
              | the Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District area [18]
              | (Fig. 1). All 8-year-old children born in 1992 attending
              | primary or special school and living in this area in autumn
              | 2000 were chosen for the target population, n = 5,484
              | (Statistics Finland, 31st of December, 2000). The teachers
              | of these children were given an information package con-
              | cerning the study, including lectures on AS and the ASSQ,
              | after which the questionnaires were distributed to parents
              | by teachers. The parents were required to provide a written
              | informed consent to participate in the study and were asked
              | to complete the ASSQ and a developmental questionnaire,
              | in which possible AS and autism diagnosis and possible
              | mental retardation were asked about. In the case of mental
              | retardation, the level (mild, moderate, severe or profound)
              | was also inquired in the developmental questionnaire.
              | Parent questionnaires were returned to teachers in closed

              | dren completed the ASSQ. The teachers were also asked
              | about the child’s curriculum: general or special needs
              | education (i.e. partly or completely adjusted education or
              | education for children with mild, moderate, severe or
              | profound mental retardation, or any other special educa-
              | tion). Finally, the teachers returned all questionnaires to the
              | researchers. Based on parents’ reports on the level of
              | mental retardation with complementary curriculum infor-
              | mation from teachers, eight children were excluded as
              | having moderate or severe mental retardation. A total of
              | 4,416 children remained in the study.
              | Missing data
              | Of these 4,416 children, 660 did not have parents’, 26
              | teachers’ and two did not have either parents’ or teachers’
              | ratings, and 183 parents’ ASSQs were discarded due to
              | missing information (i.e. 1–25 items were missing). Miss-
              | ing items in teachers’ ASSQs were asked either by regular
              | mail or by telephone, and all teachers’ ASSQs were
              | thus successfully completed. Eventually, 4,414 children
              | remained, with 3,571 parents’ and 4,388 teachers’ ASSQs.
              | ‘‘Validation sample’’ for ASSQ validity evaluations
              | Of the 4,414 children, 125 were included in the ‘‘validation
              | sample’’ in which the ASSQ validity was evaluated. The
              | sample of 125 children consisted of all 73 screening-posi-
              | tive (parent ASSQ C 19 and/or teacher ASSQ C 22; [10])
              | children and a sample of 52 screening-negative children. Of
              | the 73 screening-positive children, 24 were screening-
              | positive only in parents’, 36 only in teachers’ and 13 in both
              | ratings. The inclusion criteria of screening-negative chil-
              | dren were based on two Swedish articles [10, 12]: teacher
              | ASSQ 17-21 (n = 28) [12]; parent ASSQ 7-18 and teacher
              | ASSQ 9-16 (n = 24) [10]; these minimum scores, parent
              | ASSQ score of 7 and teacher ASSQ score of 9, were
              | selected from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
              | curves in the study of Ehlers et al. [10] with sensitivity of
              | 95%. Of the 125 children, 110 (88.0%) agreed to proceed,
              | 65 of whom were screening-positive (89.0%) and 45
              | screening-negative (86.5%). Thus, 15 children declined,

              | University Hospital of Oulu and Tahkokangas Service
              | Centre were studied. Permission to check the patient records
              | was asked from the parents. Of these 110 children, 18 were
              | outpatients with ASD diagnosis (4 AS, 6 AS traits, 1 AS

              | autismus infantilis, 1 PDD with mild mental retardation, and
              | 1 autistic traits with mild mental retardation).
              | Diagnostic re-assignments
              | These 18 outpatients with registered ASD diagnosis under-
              | went diagnostic examinations. The Autism Diagnostic
              | Interview-Revised (ADI-R; [16]), as a structured develop-
              | mental and symptom history from parent(s), and the Autism
              | Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS; [17]), module 3,
              | as a semi-structured child observation, were administered
              | and videotaped by a paediatrician (M.-L.M.), clinically
              | experienced in ASDs, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale
              | for Children-Third Revision (WISC-III) [25] was adminis-
              | tered by two psychologists. Parents were also asked to
              | supplement incompletely completed ASSQs (n = 1; four
              | items missing) or fulﬁl non-completed ASSQs (n = 3).
              | Three screening-positive outpatients with ASD were
              | now tested as having an FSIQ below 50, and they were
              | excluded, leaving 15 outpatients with ASD for further re-
              | evaluations. In the ‘‘validation sample’’, the WISC-III was
              | administered to three children without any registered ASD
              | diagnosis to ﬁnd out the accurate FSIQ level. One
              | screening-positive child had earlier been diagnosed to have
              | mild/moderate mental retardation; the FSIQ of that child
              | was now determined as below 50. Two screening-negative
              | had severe neurological disability and the previous IQ level
              | was unsure; these two still could not be tested reliably. All
              | three children were excluded from the study.
              | After diagnostic examinations, school day observations
              | of ﬁve children were undertaken to obtain more informa-
              | tion. The observations were performed by an autism
              | researcher of our team, a Master of Education (M.K.) blind
              | to the primary examinations. The observation of each child
              | lasted an entire school day, including direct observation
              | during lessons and breaks, ‘‘structured interview’’ (ASSQ)
              | and non-structured discussion with the teacher. After that,
              | re-evaluations of 15 outpatients with ASD were performed
              | by experienced clinicians (S.-L.L. and M.-L.M.) by
              | reviewing all available data (ADI-R, ADOS tapes, ASSQs,
              | patient records and school day observations). M.K. par-
              | ticipated in the re-evaluation meetings for the ﬁve children
              | whose school day was observed. The ICD-10 research
              | criteria were then fulﬁlled, item by item, based on the
              | consensus between S.-L.L. and M.-L.M. Two outpatients
              | with ASD (one AS traits and one AS suspected) did not
              | meet the ICD-10 research criteria for AS or autism. Finally,
              | 13 were re-assigned as ASD, 5 of them as AS, 6 as HFA,
              | and 2 as autism with mild mental retardation. Six of the 13
              | outpatients with re-assigned ASD were registered as ASD
              | in hospital patient records after parent and teacher ASSQ
              | ratings (i.e. after the screening phase of our study).

text          | Eventually, 4,408 (80.4%) children with ASSQ made up
              | the ‘‘total population group’’, including 3,565 (80.9%)
              | parents’ ASSQs, and 4,382 (99.4%) teachers’ ASSQs,
              | 3,539 of which (80.3%) rated by both, all of the children
              | having an FSIQ C 50 and no items missing on the ASSQs.
              | In addition, of the 4,408 children, 61 screening-positive
              | and 43 screening-negative made up a ‘‘validation sample’’
              | (n = 104), all rated by parents and 103 by teachers,
              | including 13 outpatients with registered and veriﬁed ASD.
              | The ASSQ validation was to be evaluated in the ‘‘valida-
              | tion sample’’.
              | Outpatient study
              | The ‘‘outpatient study’’ started in January 2003 and is part
              | of a larger research project concerning high-functioning
              | (FSIQ C 80) outpatient children with AS or autism of Oulu
              | University Hospital (Fig. 1). All 7–12-year-old primary
              | school-aged outpatients with AS or AS traits, excluding
              | outpatients born in 1992 (i.e. the outpatients already in the
              | ‘‘total population study’’), were invited (n = 38), and 34
              | (89.5%) participated. All parents completed the ASSQ.
              | The ASD diagnoses of 34 outpatients were re-assigned by
              | using the ADI-R [16] to acquire developmental and symp-
              | tom history from parent(s), and by using the ADOS, module
              | 3 [17] to observe the child’s behaviour and communication
              | skills. The examinations were administered and videotaped
              | by a research psychologist (K.J.). The patient records of all
              | participants were studied. The diagnoses were then rede-
              | ﬁned according to the ICD-10 research criteria, based on
              | information obtained with the ADI-R, ADOS and from
              | patient records, by a psychologist (K.J.) consulting an
              | experienced clinician (M.-L.M.) when a second opinion was
              | needed. Development in the ﬁrst 3 years of life was now
              | taken into account. In these evaluations 21 children met the
              | ICD-10 research criteria for AS and 13 for autism.
              | The teachers of all 34 children were asked to complete
              | the ASSQ 1 year later. Questionnaires were sent by regular
              | mail to the parents, who were asked to complete the con-
              | sent and then give the questionnaire to their child’s teacher.
              | The questionnaire was resent twice if the ASSQ was not
              | returned by the teacher. One 12-year-old child did not give
              | permission to the teacher to complete the ASSQ. Finally,
              | 33 teachers completed the ASSQ with parents’ (and
              | child’s) permission.
              | Eventually, the ‘‘outpatient group’’ consisted of 47
              | children (13 from the ‘‘total population study’’ and 34 from
              | the ‘‘outpatient study’’), 26 of whom met the re-assigned
              | diagnosis for AS, 19 for HFA and 2 for autism with mild
              | mental retardation. The ASSQ was completed by all par-
              | ents and by 46 teachers.
              | Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire
              | The ASSQ [10] comprises 27 items rated on a 3-point
              | scale, 0 indicating normal, 1 some abnormality and 2
              | deﬁnite abnormality. The range of score is 0–54. Eleven
              | items tap topics regarding social interaction, six cover
              | communication problems and ﬁve refer to restricted and
              | repetitive behaviour. The remaining ﬁve items embrace
              | motor clumsiness and other associated symptoms including
              | motor and vocal tics. Completing the ASSQ takes 10 min.
              | Cut-off scores of 19 or more for parents’ and 22 or more
              | for teachers’ ratings have been recommended in Sweden
              | for screening to identify ASDs in children with normal
              | intelligence or mild mental retardation in a clinical setting
              | [9, 10]. The content and concurrent and discriminating
              | validity of the questionnaire have been studied, and it has
              | been published by Ehlers et al. [10].
              | The ASSQ was ﬁrst translated into Finnish by two
              | clinically experienced psychologists and then back-trans-
              | lated into Swedish by an ofﬁcial Swedish translator. The
              | ﬁnal version was completed based on comparison between
              | the original and the back-translated Swedish forms by the
              | authors and on comments by child neurologists at Oulu
              | University Hospital. On the 3-point scale, we decided to
              | exclude the word ‘‘deﬁnite’’ from the alternative ‘‘deﬁnite
              | abnormality’’ in the Finnish version because of clinical
              | experience of Finnish parents’ reluctance to assess their
              | children’s features as ‘‘deﬁnite’’.
              | Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism
              | Diagnostic Observation Schedule
              | The ADI-R [16] is a standardized investigator-based parent
              | interview developed to elicit a full range of information
              | across all three main symptom areas needed to produce a
              | diagnosis of autism and to assist in the assessment of
              | related PDDs. The ADI-R was translated into Finnish by
              | two clinical psychologists in the 1990s and then back-
              | translated into English by an ofﬁcial English translator.
              | After comparison the ﬁnal Finnish version was completed
              | by a group of professionals in the ﬁeld of ASDs, all trained
              | in the use of the ADI-R.
              | The ADOS [17] is a semi-structured assessment of
              | social interaction, communication and play or imaginative
              | use of materials for individuals who may have autism or
              | other PDDs. The ADOS comprises four modules based on
              | the verbal level of the subject. Module 3 was used in this
              | study and was translated into Finnish by an ofﬁcial English
              | translator.

text          | the diagnostic process have been trained in the use of the
              | ADI-R and ADOS for research purposes. The cut-off
              | scores of the algorithms are standardized for autism and
              | ASDs, but there are no algorithms precisely for AS. The
              | ADI-R and ADOS algorithms were not used in this study.
              | Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Revision
              | IQ was measured by the WISC-III [25]. Throughout this
              | study, the diagnosis of ‘‘HFA’’ is used in subjects with
              | autism who had an FSIQ C 70, and the FSIQ of ‘‘higher-
              | functioning’’ subjects is deﬁned to be C50.
              | Patient records
              | The University Hospital of Oulu and/or Tahkokangas
              | Service Centre records of the subjects in the ‘‘validation
              | sample’’ and in the ‘‘outpatient group’’ were studied. Early
              | development was veriﬁed.
              | Statistical analyses
              | The distributions of total ASSQ scores were skewed in the
              | ‘‘total population group’’, while total ASSQ scores were
              | normally distributed in the ‘‘validation sample’’ and in the
              | ‘‘outpatient group’’. In skewed distributed data and in small
              | samples, non-parametric Mann–Whitney’s U-test (Z) and
              | Wilcoxon’s test were used. In normally distributed data,
              | analyses were performed by parametric t-test for two
              | independent samples and paired t-test. Correlations
              | between parents’ and teachers’ ratings were estimated
              | using Spearman’s rho in skewed distributed data and in
              | small samples, and Pearson correlation in normally dis-
              | tributed data. Correlations’ P-values are reported as one-
              | sided and others’ as two-sided. P-values \ 0.05 were
              | interpreted as signiﬁcant. ROC analyses were performed to
              | assess the discriminating validity of the ASSQ. Analyses
              | were produced with the Statistical Package for Social
              | Sciences version 16.0 for Windows.

              | means of the ASSQ scores in parents’ and teachers’ ratings
              | were signiﬁcantly higher in children with AS/autism
              | (‘‘outpatient group’’) than in the total population (‘‘total
              | population group’’). In addition, parents scored children
              | who were rated on the ASSQ in our study after receiving
              | ASD diagnosis at the outpatient clinic signiﬁcantly higher
              | than children who were rated on the ASSQ in our study
              | before receiving ASD diagnosis at the outpatient clinic.
              | This might indicate that parents of the children who were
meta          | 123
text          | Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2009) 18:499–509
              | already diagnosed as ASD at the outpatient clinic probably
              | knew better what kind of features they had to assess,
              | leading them to rate their children higher, or that they
              | already knew what was causing their children’s symptoms
              | and they were more educated to perceive certain symptoms
              | typical of ASD. Based on this discovery, it may be
              | assumed that parents might score lower on the ASSQ at
              | diagnostic examinations in clinical settings, because they
              | usually do not know very much about ASDs when their
              | child is referred to the outpatient clinic. After the child has
              | been diagnosed with ASD parents obtain knowledge about
              | ASDs, and they might score higher on the ASSQ. How-
              | ever, the number of subjects (n = 6) who were not diag-
              | nosed as ASD before ASSQ ratings was low. Therefore, the
              | effect of parents’ awareness of diagnosis on their scoring
              | should be analysed in larger samples. The teachers’ scores
              | were at the same level irrespective of whether the outpa-
              | tient ASD diagnoses were already given or not. However,
              | we did not know who of the teachers were aware of the
              | outpatient ASD diagnosis.
              | No crucial score difference between genders was found
              | in the ‘‘outpatient group’’. However, reliable conclusion
              | about the gender non-differences in higher-functioning
              | subjects with ASD has to be treated with prudence because
              | of the wide score ranges and the small number of females
              | in the ‘‘outpatient group’’ (n = 10). Baron-Cohen et al. [6]
              | also reported that male and female scores (on the Autism
              | Spectrum Quotient; AQ) did not differ signiﬁcantly among
              | the AS/HFA group; however, the number of females
              | (n = 13) was also small in their study. In turn, in the ‘‘total
              | population group’’ males were rated signiﬁcantly higher
              | than females by both parents and teachers, which lends
              | support to the assumption that females are more competent
              | in their social skills than males [6, 26]. There is a clear
              | overlap of symptoms at the behavioural level between
              | children with AS and other high-functioning children with
              | ASD based on the ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria for ASDs.
              | No signiﬁcant ASSQ score difference was found between
              | the children with AS and HFA (Fig. 2), showing that dif-
              | ferential diagnosis between AS and HFA cannot be made
              | by using the ASSQ.
              | In Finland, primary school teachers get to know their
              | pupils and their behaviour well, because there is one main
              | teacher for each class group who teaches the same pupils for
              | many hours every day from one to several years. Thus, it can
              | be assumed that both parents and teachers know the
              | behaviour of the children quite well, which might have
              | yielded high concordance in the ratings. However, agree-
              | ment between informants was slight (r = 0.207), and even
              | negative correlation (r = -0.368) was found between par-
              | ents’ and teachers’ ratings in the higher scoring ‘‘validation
              | sample’’. This might indicate that the differences in behav-
              | iour between home and school are real. In addition, the

              | better chance to notice behaviour abnormalities in social
              | interaction than the parents who may have no opportunity to
              | compare their child with peers. As described, the teachers
              | were given an information package concerning the study,
              | including lectures on AS and the ASSQ. By receiving
              | information, the teachers may have been better aware than
              | parents as to what kind of features they were supposed to
              | assess. This might skew the correlation between informants
              | in the ‘‘total population group’’. In Oulu, the biggest
              | municipality of this study and the capital of Northern
              | Ostrobothnia, we were able to obtain the information that
              | teachers from 14 schools did not took in the lectures on AS
              | and the ASSQ. However, in spite of the fact that these
              | teachers were not trained, agreement between informants
              | was slight (0.097), and in high-scoring ASSQs (parent C 7,
              | or teacher C 9), correlation was negative (r = -0.421)
              | between parents’ and teachers’ ratings, being in concor-
              | dance with the results of the high-scoring ‘‘validation sam-
              | ple’’. In contrast, Swedish and Norwegian researchers have
              | reported a stronger association between parents’ and
              | teachers’ ratings on the ASSQ. Ehlers et al. [10] reported
              | marked interrater reliability (Pearson r = 0.66) of the ASSQ
              | mean total score for parents’ and teachers’ ratings in chil-
              | dren (n = 105) who were consecutively referred to the child
              | neuropsychiatric clinic, and the correlation across infor-
              | mants for children with ASD (n = 20) was also marked
              | (r = 0.77) in their study. In turn, Posserud et al. [19]
              | reported a moderate correlation of 0.48 between teacher and
              | parent score for boys and a low correlation of 0.34 between
              | informants for girls on the ASSQ in a population sample of
              | 9,430 children. For the whole, scale agreement between
              | parents and teachers was 0.40 (weighted kappa) in the study
              | of Posserud et al. [19].
              | The ﬁrst stage of the ASSQ validation was to ﬁnd out
              | whether the original cut-offs are workable in the ‘‘outpa-
              | tient group’’. Our results showed that only two subjects
              | with ASD fell below the original parent and teacher cut-
              | offs (parent ASSQ \ 19, teacher ASSQ \ 22). In addition,
              | none of the outpatient children with ASD were rated below
              | both minimum scores with 95% sensitivity based on the
              | ROC curves in the study of Ehlers et al. [10] (parent
              | ASSQ \ 7, teacher ASSQ \ 9).
              | After the ﬁrst stage of the ASSQ validation, we pro-
              | ceeded to the second phase to evaluate the statistics of
              | the ASSQ. For this reason, all potential children with ASD
              | [10, 12] were selected from the ‘‘total population study’’
              | to make up a ‘‘validation sample’’ in which the ASSQ
              | validation was evaluated. Generalizations of the validity
              | ﬁndings might be limited to the clinical settings when
              | diagnosing higher-functioning patients who are suspected
              | to have AS or autism. Generalization to whole population
              | screening has to be treated with caution because the
              | ‘‘validation sample’’ was not selected randomly. We gave
              | up random selection because of the low number of ASD
              | diagnoses in total population [e.g. 3, 23].
              | Based on our results, the use of the original Swedish cut-
              | off of 22 [10] with 85% sensitivity and 69% speciﬁcity for
              | teacher ASSQ score is indicated in Finland as well.
              | In contrast, Ehlers et al. [10] reported poorer sensitivity
meta          | 123
              | 508
text          | (65–70%) and better speciﬁcity (91%) for the teacher
              | cut-off score of 22. However, according to our results the
              | ASSQ seems to work best by using a summed parents’ and
              | teacher’s score. In clinical settings, it is important to screen
              | all potential ASD subjects. Thus, the cut-off score of 30 for
              | the summed parents’ and teacher’s score is recommended
              | to be used in clinical settings with 100% sensitivity and
              | 73% speciﬁcity. Ehlers et al. [10] estimated the cut-off
              | score of 19 for parents’ ratings with the sensitivity of
              | 62–82% and the speciﬁcity of 90%. Importantly, in Finland
              | the ASSQ seemed to be invalid in identifying subjects with
              | AS/autism, if single rating by parents was used: if sensi-
              | tivity was high, speciﬁcity was low, and vice versa. Thus,
              | there is a strong caution against the use of single ASSQ
              | rating by parents when screening higher-functioning chil-
              | dren with suspected AS/autism.
              | This study showed that the Finnish ASSQ works as a
              | screening instrument with some limitations. The ASSQ
              | identiﬁes the majority of higher-functioning children with
              | AS/autism by using the summed parents’ and teacher’s score
              | or by using single rating by teacher. NPVs (1.00; 0.97) were
              | excellent, showing that no children with AS/autism fell
              | below the cut-offs in summed parents’ and teacher’s ratings
              | and only few children in single ratings by teacher; i.e. it is
              | unlikely that a child has AS/autism if rated below the cut-off
              | scores in summed parents’ and teacher’s or in single tea-
              | cher’s rating. However, PPVs (0.35; 0.28) were very low,
              | indicating that many subjects without a registered AS or
              | autism diagnosis were rated above the cut-offs in summed
              | parents’ and teacher’s ratings and in single teacher’s ratings.
              | In turn, Ehlers et al. [10] did not report any PPV or NPV
              | values in their study. Our validation ﬁndings are preliminary;
              | research is ongoing and more results are expected later.
              | Conclusions
              | First, because of the low PPV it is emphasized that the
              | ASSQ is a screening instrument, not a diagnostic instru-
              | ment; all screening-positive children have to undergo
              | diagnostic examinations.
              | Second, this article points out the importance of using
              | multiple informants, as also suggested by previous studies
              | concerning ASDs [e.g. 3, 18–20, 24]. Although the cut-off
              | score could not be estimated for single parent ratings, the
              | cut-off score for summed parents’ and teacher’s ratings
              | turned out to be the best.
