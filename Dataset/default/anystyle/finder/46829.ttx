              | 1. Introduction
              | Late 20th century can be described as a flourishing period of the democratic societies’ development. Before
              | World War II, only 28% of countries worldwide claimed to be democratic. By the end of 20th century,
              | particularly after the fall of the Berlin wall, this figure increased to 62%. Whether the process of the
              | democratization of the societies will continue, depends mostly on the citizens’ willingness to be actively
              | involved in political and civic activities, such as: defining issues, policy making, solving public problems,
              | taking responsibility for building communities, and participating in the political and electoral processes.
              | According to William Damon (2001), the process of the democratization worldwide is not moving in
              | the right direction in particular because of the civic and political disengagement of the young people.
              | Indifference is the greatest in mature democracies, but is apparent in many new democracies or
              | problematic one. Today, as he claims, the general young people’s attitude towards democracy is apathy or
              | cynicism.
              | On the other hand, higher education is recognized as key to delivering the knowledge requirements
              | for political development. It is essential for the design and operation of key political institutions of a modern
              | political system, from the judiciary to the legislative and executive arms of government, the top staffing of
              | the state bureaucracy as well as key institutions of civil society. Moreover, public higher education in
              | democracies is typically mandated to contribute to the development of an enlightened, critically constructive
              | citizenry (Luescher-Mamashela, 2011: 9).
              | Hence, many researchers, with significant funding from foundations, have focused on the college
              | student demographic to assess the civic and political health of the nation’s new generations. Results show
              | a generation that is both disconnected from conventional politics, and yet has much civic potential. There is
              | widespread evidence, along with a general characterization in the media, that college students today are
              | cynical and apathetic about politics. Survey research has also demonstrated that young people are
              | considerably less knowledgeable of and interested in political affairs (Longo and Meyer, 2006: 5).
              | Having in mind that the Republic of Macedonia is considered to be a young democracy, the
              | discussion pertaining to the relevance and significance of democracy is one of the most contested issues in
              | the political and academic debates in the Republic of Macedonia. The issue of democracy, as well as the
              | issue of the citizens’ engagement in political and civic activities, is of a great importance particularly having
              | in mind the fact that a stable democratic regime does not only require well-designed and functioning
              | political institutions and processes to be sustainable and consolidated; it requires democrats (Mattes et al.
              | 1999).
              | The paper gives an insight into attitudes towards democracy of young people in Republic of
              | Macedonia, in particular their interest in politics and their engagement in civic and political activities. The
              | findings in the paper rely on the data from following research projects: Virtual and Real Identities in the
              | Republic of Macedonia1, Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia2 и Youth Study Macedonia 20133.
              | 1 The project was conducted by the Institute for Sociological, Political and Juridical Research – Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.
              | The project was based on the research of political attitudes and identities of the student population in Macedonia, by direct
              | surveying of respondents. The survey was conducted from September 2012 until July 2013. The number of respondents in the
              | survey is representative for the Republic of Macedonia in terms of ethnicity, gender, religion, place of residence and region. It
              | covered a group of 707 respondents. General characteristics of the sample were the following: 707 students from 4 state
              | universities and 2 private universities; 256 male and 451 female students; Macedonians 442, Albanians 239 and others 26; 201
              | were living in rural and 504 in urban areas. All the respondents were third and fourth year students. The survey was undertaken
              | among the students on the universities in Skopje, Bitola, Shtip and Tetovo.

              | The paper includes questions that explore the attitudes of young people towards democracy, in
              | particular their interest in politics, their civic and political engagement:
              |  Are young people interested in politics;
              |  Where do they get information about politics and do they use news media;
              |  How often they discuss about politics with their friends;
              |  Their engagement in civic activities and civic associations;
              |  Their engagement in political activities i.e. electoral participation;
              | Throughout this paper, the pursuit of these questions is interlaced with a comparative
              | analytical perspective involving the following dimensions:
              |  Comparison of the attitudes of young people towards democracy by their ethnic belonging;
              |  Comparison of the attitudes towards democracy by their gender;
              | Having in mind that this review focuses on attitudes of young people towards democracy, the
              | notions of democracy, is to be further defined and elaborated on.
              | 2. Understanding Democracy
              | ‘Democracy’ is one of the most used and arguable concepts in more recent history, particularly after the fall
              | of the Berlin Wall. Definitions and operationalization of this concept vary quite a bit. Hence, even though
              | there is no universally accepted definition, there are two approaches in defining democracy: ‘minimal’ and
              | ‘maximal’. The first one focuses on the importance of ‘means’, that is, procedures such as fair elections,
              | respect for human rights, and universal suffrage. In contrast, maximal definitions include not only
              | democratic procedures but also ‘ends’, or outputs (such as economic equality and social services)
              | (Baviskar and Malone, 2004: 4).
              | Democracy in political theory is described as a political philosophy, but also as a form of governing
              | where the governing power lies in the hands of people, and it may be exercised either in an immediate
              | (direct democracy) or intermediate manner (indirect democracy), i.e. according to the principle of
              | presentation and representation of interests realized by virtue of free and fair elections. Modern or
              | contemporary interpretation of democracy is connected with the philosophical principle of equal rights.
              | Hence, the notion of democracy is occasionally used in the context of liberal democracy, which on the other
              | hand implies existence of certain additional elements, such as political pluralism, equality before the law,
              | civil freedoms and civil rights, i.e. all the agents in a civil society. Furthermore, these elements represent a
              | parameter regarding the level of democracy within societies (Atanasov and Cvetanova, 2013: 27).
              | 2 The survey research was conducted by the Institute for Sociological, Political and Juridical Research – Skopje and Agency for
              | Youth and Sport in the period between October and December 2014. This survey research (vis-à-vis) was conducted covering a
              | representative sample of the young population (aged 15 to 29). The final number of respondents in the survey research was
              | 1190.
              | 3 The survey research was conducted by the Institute for Sociological, Political and Juridical Research – Skopje and Friedrich
              | Ebert Stifung in the period between September and November 2013. A combined approach employing both quantity and quality
              | techniques and procedures was implemented in the course of the survey research. This survey research (vis-à-vis) was
              | conducted covering a representative sample of the young population, as well as semi-structured in-depth interviews with both
              | typical and atypical representatives of the young population. The final number of respondents was 1026, whereas the surveyed
              | population was aged 15 to 29.

              | Different scholars define democracy in different ways. Definitions of democracy often are
              | influenced by the aspect they emphasize. For example: some of the definitions focus on the institutions and
              | procedures of democratic governance, others on political aspect i.e. freedom and liberties, and third take
              | into account the social dimension i.e. social benefits.
              | These three broad alternatives—institutions and procedures, freedom and liberties, and social
              | benefits—constitute the primary substantive choices in defining democracy. Certainly people will offer other
              | responses if asked to define democracy spontaneously. Yet the extent to which democracy is defined in
              | terms of these three broad choices provides a framework to assess the high levels of public support for
              | democracy in recent public-opinion surveys and the implications of these democratic aspirations. Each
              | alternative has different implications for the interpretation of public opinion toward democracy and the
              | principles that guide the democratization process (Dalton, Shin, and Jou, 2007: 145).
              | Despite many definitions and different approaches in defining democracy, political theory highlights
              | three pillars that underpin democracy: transparency, accountability and right to participate. Therefore,
              | citizen participation – as one of the three pillars - is regarded widely as vital to democracy. The classic
              | Kantian distinction between active and passive citizens implies that only those citizens who in one way or
              | another actively participate in decision-making are indeed different from the subjects of a nondemocratic
              | polity (Weinrib, 2008).
              | 3. Republic of Macedonia
              | Republic of Macedonia, as a relatively young democratic country, gained its independence in the so-called
              | ‘third wave of democratization’, i.e. in the year 1991 following the dissolution of the Socialist Federal
              | Republic of Yugoslavia. Regarding the political pattern, Macedonia relies upon parliamentary democracy
              | with an executive government elected by a unicameral parliament. The Assembly (parliament) is made up
              | of 123 seats and the members are elected every four years. The role of the President of the Republic is
              | mostly ceremonial and the real /executive power rests in the hands of the Government which makes the
              | prime minister the most politically powerful person in the country. Various political indicators of democracy
              | and good governance indicate that the democratisation of the society is an ongoing process or, in other
              | words, the society is still in a process of democratic transition4.
              | The country is located in the central Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe, with a total population
              | of around 2 million. A quarter of the population (approximately 500,000) is located in the biggest city and
              | capital, Skopje. Most residents are concentrated in the urban areas i.e. in moderately sized cities with a
              | population of more than 20, 000.
              | According to the ethnic composition of the population, Macedonian society is regarded as a
              | multiethnic, multicultural and multiconfessional. Despite the Macedonian majority (66, 6%) there are other
              | ethnic communities living on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia: Albanian ethnic community (22,
              | 7%), Turkish (4, 0%), Serbian (2, 1%), Vlachs (0, 4%) and others (1, 9%). Regarding the religious affiliation,
              | 67% of the population belongs to the Christian- orthodox religion and 30% to Islam.
              | 4 According to Linz and Stepan (1996) a democratic transition is complete when a sufficient agreement has been reached about
              | political procedures to produce an elected government, when a government comes to power that is the direct result of a free and
              | popular vote, when this government de facto has the authority to generate new policies, and when the executive, legislative and
              | judicial powers generated by the new democracy does not have to share the power with the other bodies de jure.

              | All of these ethnic communities living in the Republic of Macedonia, including the Macedonian
              | majority, have their own cultures created in accordance with the cultural history of the group they belong to.
              | They have different cultural and value systems, different patterns of social life, language, religion, tradition
              | and customs. The overlapping of the divisions among the ethnic communities - primarily due to their
              | different ethnic belonging, religious affiliation and usage of different language - makes the Macedonian
              | society even more fragile. This division is particularly accentuated between the Macedonian majority and
              | the biggest ethnic community – Albanian (Cvetanova, 2014: 35).
              | The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the Republic of Macedonia was 5110 $/per capita (2013)5.
              | The unemployment rate in Macedonia amounts to 27, 6% (as per the fourth quarter of 2014)6, whereas in
              | the case of the youngest population aged 15 to 24 it amounts to 50, 4%. According to the researchers’
              | estimations the unemployment rate among the young population aged 15 to 297 amounts to 45, 5%
              | (Jakimovski, 2014:22)
              | The total number of young people in Macedonia aged 15 to 29 is 457 4778 or 23% of the total
              | population. According to the data of the State Statistical Office obtained on the basis of received reports,
              | there were 57 746 enrolled students in the Republic of Macedonia in the academic year 2013/2014, an
              | increase of 1.5% compared to the academic year 2012/2013. The number of enrolled female students was
              | 31 450 or 54.5%. The majority of students, 88.5%, were enrolled in public tertiary institutions, while 11.1%
              | were enrolled in private tertiary institutions.
              | 4. Interest in Politics
              | According to Oxford Dictionary of Politics, political participation refers to taking part in politics. Although
              | political discussion does not fit in with this classic definition of political participation, yet it is an important
              | feature of democratic citizenship. Political discussion can also mean an attempt to influence given
              | government policy or the selection of government leaders who create government policies. When it comes
              | to contemporary democratic systems, citizens are allowed to discuss their problems freely, express and
              | voice their dissatisfaction and complaints and request changes. (Atanasov, Cvetanova, 2013: 33).
              | Pursuant to the survey research ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’, the largest number
              | of respondents stated that they were partly interested in politics (51, 6%), whereas 8, 8% stated that they
              | were very interested in politics. Approximately 40% of the respondents stated that they were not interested
              | in politics at all (Cekic, 2014: 62-64).
              | Even though the direction is the same, the focal point of the survey research ‘Real and Virtual
              | Identities’ is students. Certain deviations are noticeable in this survey research, i.e. the interest in political
              | issues is evident in a greater number of respondents. Hence, 18,2% of the students responded that they
              | were very interested in politics, 32,9% responded that they were not interested in this topic at all, whereas
              | the other half of students responded that they were partly interested in politics (48,7%). Male students are
              | more interested in politics compared to female students, and the same applies to the members of the
              | Albanian ethnic group as opposed to the Macedonian ethnic group. In this context, 28, 6% of male students
              | and 12, 2% of female students stated that they were very interested in politics, whereas the percentage of
              | 5 http://kushnirs.org/macroeconomics/gdp/gdp_macedonia.html (30.03.2015)

              | 7 The State Statistical Office does not keep this category as a special one, and therefore the researchers’ estimations have been
              | taken as relevant ones
              | 8 Official data from the State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia and the latest estimations of the population dated
              | 31.12.2013 were used taking into account that the latest census of the population was conducted in the year 2002.

              | the response ‘I am partly interested’ is almost identical in the case of the two groups. A lack of interest in
              | politics among female students could be interpreted in the light of a generally negative attitude to women
              | and their representation and participation in politics due to the traditional and conservative values which are
              | typical for the cultural background of the people living in Macedonia. This negative attitude is reflected in
              | the number of women in politics which is significantly lower compared to the number of men, particularly in
              | terms of the executive and local government (Cvetanova, Naumovska, 2014: 26).
              | With reference to ethnicity, 26,4% of students from the Albanian ethnic group stated that they were
              | very interested in politics as opposed to only 14,1% of the Macedonians who produced the same response.
              | The increased interest in politics among the students that belong to the Albanian ethnic community,
              | as opposed to Macedonians, is probably due to the fact that they consider the implementation of the Ohrid
              | Framework Agreement, i.e. the resolving of ethnic issues as an open and still ongoing process (Cvetanova,
              | Naumovska, 2014: 25).
              | 4.1 Where do they get information about politics and do they use news media?
              | Despite the fact that the access to the Internet and the ever more increased use of social networks have
              | dominated as a starting point in obtaining information, the survey research indicates that in the Republic of
              | Macedonia television still plays a pivotal role when it comes to obtaining information about political issues.
              | In accordance with the data derived from the survey research ‘Youth Study Macedonia 2013’, 87, 9% of the
              | young people obtain information about political issues from the television, 75, 9% from the Internet,
              | followed by 52, 7% who obtain information from discussions with their friends, 52, 2% from discussions with
              | family members, 42, 4% who use the newspapers and 27, 2% who use the radio as a source of
              | information. The presented findings point out to the fact that the young use different sources of information
              | when building their attitudes and viewpoints (Topuzovska Latkovikj et all. 2013: 97).
              | The findings from the survey research ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’ gives us a
              | comprehensive image of the interest in politics among the young people compared to other day-to-day
              | topics. The findings indicated that the first most searched topic in media for almost half of the young
              | (46,5%) was information regarding celebrities, music and/or film, followed by information about political or
              | economic affairs (16,2%), information pertaining to sports events and athletes (15,5%) and topics
              | pertaining to culture (13,4%). The lowest number of respondents (6, 1%) search the media for information
              | regarding crime and corruption. Interest in political and economic affairs as the first most searched content
              | is unsurprisingly higher among the oldest respondents (aged 25 to 29, represented by 27, 7%), and lowest
              | among the youngest (aged 15 to 19, represented by 4, 5%). As for ethnicity, there is a significant
              | difference, i.e. information pertaining to economic and political affairs is twice more searched as a primary
              | topic among the Albanian respondents (25, 2%) compared to the Macedonian respondents (11%)
              | (Babunski, 2014: 72, 73).
              | 4.2 How often young people discuss about politics with their friends?
              | An indicator that highlights the genuine interest and the role that politics plays in the day-to-day life of the
              | young people is the response to the question of how often they discuss politics with their friends. In
              | compliance with the data derived from the survey research ‘Real and Virtual Identities’, the responses
              | provided were as follow: very often 17, 8%, sometimes 61, 6% and never 19, 8%. Nonetheless, the
              | information obtained by interrelation of the questions “Are you interested in politics?” and “How often do
              | you discuss politics with your friends?” and the cross tabulation is that 47, 8% of the respondents who are

              | not interested in politics sometimes discuss these topics with their friends. (Cvetanova, Naumovska, 2014:
              | 27).
              | With reference to the interest in politics, the results indicate that the largest number of respondents
              | are partly interested in these issues, but at the same time they indicate that almost one half of the
              | respondents discuss politics even though they are not interested in it. This may be due to the ongoing
              | process of democratic transition and the continual changes in each and every segment of social life. This is
              | further conditioned by the high rate of unemployment which is particularly pronounced in the case of the
              | young population. These issues are included in the programs and policies of any government and their
              | regulation is crucial for the young.
              | 4.3 Civic and Political Engagement
              | Citizen engagement may be defined as a process in which ordinary people take part – whether on a
              | voluntary or obligatory basis and whether acting alone or as part of a group – with the goal of influencing a
              | decision involving significant choices that will affect their community. Such engagement may or may not
              | take place within an institutional framework, and it may be organized either by members of civil society (for
              | example, through class action, demonstrations, citizens’ committees, etc.) or by decision-makers (for
              | example, through referendums, parliamentary commissions and mediation (André, 2010). As Longo and
              | Meyer (2006) claim, the strength of any democratic society lies in an actively engaged citizenry.
              | 4.3.1 Civic Engagement
              | The study ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’ elaborates on the civic engagement of
              | young people in Macedonia, as within the educational institutions, and in a broader social context.
              | According to the collected data, 43, 6% of the young involved in the educational process take part in setting
              | requirements within the school/university. A slightly lower percentage of respondents (33%) at least
              | sometimes resort to protests that have not been announced, but which they regard as fair.
              | As far as the civic engagement of young people in a wider social context is concerned (beyond the
              | educational institutions), somewhat different results have been obtained – a lower engagement on the part
              | of the young has been registered. Namely, 29,4% of the young take part in setting requirements, whereas
              | 34,2% of the young have at least once signed a petition or have resorted to certain previously announced
              | protests. A slightly lower percentage of respondents (27, 9%) at least sometimes resort to protests that
              | have not been announced, but which they regard as fair (Cekic, 2014: 67, 68).
              | Although non-political in its nature, participation in socially useful work i.e. in non-profit services for
              | the benefit of the community is another fundamental aspect of democratic society and democratic
              | citizenship. Participation in civic associations is not just important only because it develops civic skills, but
              | also because it is critical to establishing social and political networks that are so important for political
              | activity. Associating with other citizens about any interest on any basis increases the probability of
              | establishing contact with government and for active involvement in politics. As Nie and Hillygus (2001)
              | claim, even members of a garden club can be drawn into politics because the government controls what
              | seeds can be grown and what fertilizers should be used.
              | Hence, the findings in terms of youth engagement in civic associations in Macedonia, presented in
              | the study ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’, may even be regarded pessimistic. Namely, a high
              | percentage of young people, i.e. 53, 8% are not members of any organization. As for those that are
              | engaged (multiple choice answers allowed), the highest percentage of engagement is evident in sports/
              | recreation organizations (11, 9%), humanitarian organizations (11, 7%), student/high school organizations

              | (11%), cultural/arts organizations (9, 4%), youth organizations (9, 3%), political parties (9, 3%), religious
              | organizations (6%) and human rights organizations (5, 8%) (Cekic, 2014: 67, 68).
              | 4.3.2 Political Engagement
              | One of the crucial indicators pertaining to the engagement of the young people in politics is the use
              | of the democratic right to vote. Voting represents a higher level of political activity compared to the
              | previously processed ones and is the most immediate way to assess the attitude of the young towards
              | politics (for example whether it is a case of apathy, etc.). Unfortunately, there is no information about voter
              | turnout in Macedonia with reference to age groups, which further implies that only research-based data
              | may be used as indicators of this phenomenon.
              | According to the findings presented in ‘Youth Study Macedonia 2013’, 41% of the young
              | responded that they have always voted at elections, whereas 31% responded that they have voted several
              | times. Having in mind that 19% of the respondents are not eligible to vote, only 7% of the young people
              | responded that they have never voted. Hence, the authors of this study are of the opinion that there are
              | other reasons that motivate the young people to go out and vote having in mind that the interest in politics
              | on the part of the young is noticeably lower. In conformity with the data obtained, it is the ethnic
              | Macedonians that most often vote in elections, whereas the ethnic Albanians and members of the smaller
              | communities more seldom vote. The difference among ethnic communities grouped in such a way is
              | approximately 10%. (Topuzovska Latkovikj et all. 2013).
              | As far as the same question is concerned, there are minor discrepancies among the data obtained
              | from the survey research ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’ which may be due to the provided
              | modalities9. According to this survey research, approximately one half of the respondents almost always
              | vote (49, 8%), 22, 7% sometimes use their right to vote, and only 7, 3% of the respondents stated that they
              | have never voted (having in mind that the target group of the survey research was young people between
              | 15 and 29 years of age, 20, 2% are not eligible to vote). Excluding the young people who are not eligible to
              | vote, it could be inferred that 58% of the young who are eligible to vote have almost always voted, whereas
              | 28, 5% have voted sometimes (Cekic: 2014: 64, 65).
              | The existence of trust towards political leaders and political parties, in most cases is an
              | indicator of the attitude of young people towards politics and occasionally it affects their decision about
              | more pro-active engagement in activities with reference to the political processes in any society.
              | Two questions from the survey research ‘Youth Study Macedonia 2013’ (2013: 27, 97, 98) illustrate
              | the young people’s trust towards the political leaders and political parties.
              | By employing the Likert scale ranging from 1 to 10 (1 being ‘I do not trust them at all’, and 10 being
              | ‘I trust them completely’) and referring to 10 social groups and individuals, the young people expressed
              | their level of trust. The trust they have towards the political leaders and towards the people with different
              | political convictions is the lowest. As far as the political leaders are concerned, the mean value is 3, 18,
              | whereas the level of trust towards people with different political convictions is characterized by a mean
              | value of 4, 29, which may be a sole indicator of the existence of a politicized and a divided society.
              | Additionally, the figures regarding the trust towards the political parties are the lowest compared to
              | all other provided answers (a total of 16), i.e. compared to all indicated public and private institutions, as
              | well as international organizations, media, nongovernmental organizations, religious organizations, trade
              | 9 Namely, the answer ‘I always vote’ was provided as a first answer in the first study research, whereas the answer ‘I almost
              | always vote’ was provided as first answer in the second survey research.

              | much’), the mean value of political parties is 1, 95.
              | On the basis of the presented findings and pertaining to the level of trust that the young people
              | have towards the political leaders and political parties it may be inferred that it is on a rather low level. The
              | survey research highlights that the lack of trust or the low level of trust towards these political entities
              | results in apathy among citizens. Nevertheless, despite the low level of trust towards political leaders and
              | political parties, apathy is non-existent among the Macedonian young people.
              | 5. Young People and Macedonian Society
              | Taking into account that the Macedonian society is still regarded as a society in democratic transition, one
              | of the key elements of consideration regarding the awareness towards democracy of the young people in
              | Macedonia is their perception of the democratic development. In this sense, the following attitudes and
              | viewpoints were taken into consideration: their satisfaction with reference to democratic development of the
              | Macedonian society; their willingness to stay or leave the country and the type of society they would like to
              | live in.
              | According to Youth Study Macedonia 2013, as far as the satisfaction with reference to democratic
              | development of the Macedonian society is concerned, the mean value of answers from the overall sample
              | is M=2,74 (on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 denotes very disappointed, whereas 5 denotes very satisfied).
              | Girls are more satisfied with the democratic development (M=2, 85) as opposed to boys (M=2, 63) and the
              | same applies to the members of the Albanian ethnic community (M=2, 54) as opposed to the members of
              | the Macedonian ethnic community (M=2, 39). There is a statistically significant difference in both presented
              | cases (T. Latkovikj et all. 2013: 112). The fact that the members of the Albanian ethnic community are more
              | satisfied with the democratic development in the Republic of Macedonia compared to the Macedonians is
              | probably due to the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement10, in particular concessions
              | made11, and the implemented affirmative measures12 for the benefit of the ethnic communities. This attitude
              | of young Albanians fully corresponds with the attitude of the wider Albanian community. Namely, members
              | of the Albanian ethnic community are of the opinion that with the implementation of the Ohrid Framework
              | Agreement, Macedonia finally acquired the model of political system thus enabling Albanians to earn their
              | well-deserved status in society (Cvetanova, 2014: 37).
              | Probably, due to the fact that young Albanian respondents are more satisfied with the democratic
              | development in the Republic of Macedonia, they – in much higher percentage compared to young
              | Macedonians – would like to remain to live in the country.
              | 10 The Ohrid Framework Agreement ended the seven-month armed conflict between the Albanian Paramilitary Formation called
              | National Liberation Army and Macedonian security forces in 2001. The objective of the Agreement was to meet the requirements
              | on the part of the Albanian ethnic community in Macedonia, but at the same time for the purpose of preserving the unitary
              | character of the state. The Document incorporated both general principles and suggestions for solving concrete interethnic
              | problems, such as: decentralization, non-discrimination in public service, special parliamentary procedures for changing the
              | constitution and other major laws, education and language matters, as well as the expression of identity. The Agreement was
              | implemented in the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Macedonia.
              | 11 It primarily refers to the use of languages of the ethnic communities. According to the Ohrid Framework Agreement the official
              | language throughout Macedonia and in the international relations of Macedonia is the Macedonian language. But - as stated in
              | the Agreement - with respect to local self-government, in municipalities where a community comprises at least 20 percent of the
              | population of the municipality, the language of that community will be used as an official language in addition to Macedonian.
              | With respect to languages spoken by less than 20 percent of the population of the municipality, the local authorities will decide
              | democratically on their use in public bodies.
              | 12 Appropriate and fair representation of the members of the ethnic communities in the public and state administration.

              | But, first of all, we should consider the overall data from Youth Study Macedonia 2013 regarding
              | this issue. Namely, one half of the respondents, i.e. 53% of the young people, is thinking of (31%) or has
              | already decided (22%) to leave Macedonia. The most desired destination among the young people is the
              | Western Europe countries. This destination is opted for by 55% of the respondents, followed by the USA
              | and/or Canada, opted for by 25%. Financial reasons are the key motive for leaving the country of origin, as
              | stated by 65% of the young people. One third of the young people (33%) who are thinking of leaving the
              | country, are planning to remain there forever (Topuzovska Latkovikj et all. 2013: 56).
              | As before mentioned, there are noticeably different migration trends among the young Macedonian
              | and Albanian people. A total of 55% of the surveyed young Macedonians are planning to leave the country,
              | as opposed to 57% of the members of the Albanian ethnic community that are not thinking of leaving the
              | country and going abroad. This trend is further acknowledged by the survey research Real and Virtual
              | Identities.
              | As evident from the enclosed table, the percentage of respondents that agree with the statement ‘I
              | will remain to live in Macedonia’ is greater among the Albanian students (Table 1).

              | In 2001 - as a result of the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement a new political
              | pattern was inaugurated in Macedonia. Hence, it is of great importance to take into consideration the
              | attitudes of young people towards the type of society (in terms of political pattern) they would like to live in.
              | According to the collected data from the research project Real and Virtual Identities, 45, 7% of the
              | respondents opted for civil, 39, 5% for multicultural and 2, and 4% opted for bi-ethnic. The greatest
              | statistically relevant difference is evident when this question is analyzed from the aspect of ethnicity.
              | It may be inferred that the percentage of respondents that are in favour of the civil society is higher

              | It is evident that the division among the ethnic communities in Macedonia - particularly accentuated
              | between the Macedonian majority and the biggest ethnic community (Albanian) – is reflected in different
              | views and opinions regarding the concept of the political pattern. In other words, young Albanians prefer
              | multicultural society rather than civil one. It should be emphasized that the newly inaugurated political
              | pattern shifted the focal point from individual to collective rights (the ethnic ones) and on behalf of the larger
              | communities, thus enabling the individual to realize his/her rights (economic, social, cultural, political)
              | through the ethnic community they belong to. This political pattern inevitably leads to a sheer model of
              | ethnic pluralism with elements of consociational democracy instead to the declared multicultural
              | endeavours (Cvetanova, 2007: 153, 2014: 37).
              | 6. Conclusions
              | The democratization of the Macedonian society – as a society in democratic transition – is largely
              | dependent on the democratic awareness of its citizens and their political viewpoints and values. In this
              | context, the willingness of the citizens and of the young people in particular is of pivotal importance with
              | reference to their engagement and participation in all political and civic activities within the society.
              | Nonetheless, the findings from the conducted research in Macedonia point out to certain
              | indifference and disengagement in terms of the political and civic activities of the young people.
              | The fact that there are major differences among the young people pertaining to their interest in
              | politics and their satisfaction with the democratic development of the society is of particular interest and it is
              | worth highlighting. This fact is even more remarkable from the aspect of their ethnicity.
              | Namely, the young people of Albanian ethnicity, as opposed to the young Macedonians, are more
              | interested, discuss politics more and are consequently much more informed about the current political
              | affairs in the Republic of Macedonia. This is probably due to the fact that the Albanian ethnic community in
              | Macedonia is of the opinion that the ethnic issues (minority and cultural rights) have not been fully realized,
              | and hence their interest in the current political affairs in the country is greater. The different viewpoints and

              | visions concerning the political structure further prove this. The young Macedonians, who constitute a
              | majority, would like the Macedonian society to be a civic, as opposed to the young Albanians who envisage
              | it as a multicultural.
              | On the other hand, certain contradiction has been ascertained regarding the level of satisfaction
              | with the democratic development of the society in the case of the young Albanians. Compared to the other
              | ethnic communities, including the Macedonian majority, the young Albanians are most satisfied with the
              | democratic development of the society. Hence, the percentage of respondents who stated that they would
              | not like to leave the country and would like to remain in Macedonia for ever is the highest among the young
              | Albanians.
              | As for the engagement in civic associations, there are no differences pertaining to ethnicity. The
              | generally weak engagement of the young people in Macedonia, which is ultimately pessimistic, indicates
              | non-existence of awareness regarding the relevance and significance of such engagement. Namely,
              | participation in civic associations is not just important because it develops civic skills, but also because it is
              | critical to establishing social and political networks that are so important for political activity. Associating
              | with other citizens about any interest on any basis increases the probability of establishing contact with
              | government and for active involvement in politics.
              | Regarding the trust towards political leaders and political parties, despite the low level of trust,
              | apathy is non-existent among the Macedonian young people when it comes to their electoral participation.
              | The identification of causes of such a phenomenon is crucial for our society, which is an additional impetus
              | to research this topic further.
              | Nevertheless, further systematic and comprehensive research of the political viewpoints and
              | values of the young people in Macedonia is needed, in addition to continual observance of their civic and
              | political engagement, taking into account that the successful democratization of any society depends on the
              | level of democratic awareness of its citizens and their willingness to be actively involved in political and
              | civic activities.
