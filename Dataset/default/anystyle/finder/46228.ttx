              | Intergenerational transmission of trajectories
              | of suffering in precarious environments
              | Researching the younger generations’ strategies of
              | reinterpretation
              | Abstract:
              | This article discusses some pivotal questions regarding processes of the intergenerational
              | transmission of trajectories of suffering in precarious places: to what extent can such pro-
              | cesses provide resources that foster agency, and to what extent do they rather constitute
              | barriers to living one’s own life? How much do intergenerational relations allow for cer-
              | tain reinterpretations while discouraging or inhibiting others? Which reinterpretations of
              | the older generations’ experiences appear legitimate in certain contexts, and which are
              | rebuked by one’s social environment?
              | In order to pursue these questions we present analyses of two very different cases that
              | are based on two forms of data material – the life story of Emma, a woman in her 50s,
              | and ethno-analytic group interviews with adolescents aged 14 to 20. Both cases are em-
              | bedded in very different regional and political contexts: the former, in the French system
              | of fostering institutions, and the latter a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank.
              | Both constitute, however, cases of intergenerational transmission of trajectories of suffer-
              | ing. One objective of this article is to illustrate how the contrasting of such cases across
              | different kinds of data and contexts can be heuristically useful for methodologically gaug-
              | ing the spectrum of the ubiquitous and sometimes paradoxical phenomena of intergenera-
              | tional transmission, in order to further develop its conceptualization.
              | Key words: intergenerational transmission, precarious environments, narratives, gener-
              | ations, fostering, refugee camp.
              | 1 Introduction
              | Intergenerational transmission is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has been dis-
              | cussed across disciplines such as psychoanalysis, sociology, psychology, history,
              | and education. It comes into play when we debate questions of the very reproduc-
              | tion of society, the relationship between structure and agency therein, collective
              | memory, the reproduction of social status and power relations, of historical and
              | family narratives, of cultural practices etc. The objects or contents of these pro-

              | cesses can be manifold, and of a very different nature or essence. According to
              | Daniel Bertaux and Isabelle Bertaux-Wiame (1988, pp.8‒9), there is not just one
              | sort of transmission, but many, and of very different objects or contents, i.e. “of
              | behavior and attitude models, values and bans, linguistic resources, perceptive,
              | cognitive, scholastic, communicational, affective, economic and legacy resources.”
              | Daniel Bertaux and Paul Thompson – a sociologist and a historian in reference to
              | the psychoanalyst Pierre Legendre – assert a universality of the desire for trans-
              | mission in intergenerational relationships. Moreover, they emphasize that for the
              | participants it is not so much the particular content, but the mere fact that some-
              | thing is passed on and “that transmission to children in itself constitutes a rela-
              | tionship transcending the limitations of human mortality,” (Bertaux/Thompson
              | 1993, pp. 6–7). The latter emphasis on action versus content seems of particular
              | importance for research on intergenerational transmission in precarious environ-
              | ments, where parents are economically not well off and socially excluded. In the
              | same vein, Catherine Delcroix, in her study on intergenerational transmission in
              | a marginalized neighborhood in Toulouse, asserts:
              | [It] is the act of transmission itself that is important over and above the content. In fami-
              | lies with few or no resources, where there is no objective ‘capital’ to transmit, there are
              | still the nontangible assets of moral values and love which, together with the family his-
              | tory, can give meaning to the current situation (…). Communicating family history can
              | therefore enrich the minds of young people, whilst at the same time giving them an iden-
              | tity which is other than that associated with their rejection by schools, the labour market
              | and by the way in which society in general shapes its discourse on ethnic minority youths.
              | (Delcroix 1999, p. 187)
              | Delcroix emphasizes that, in many cases, the only resource parents in such pre-
              | carious social environments can rely on “is of a subjective nature, composed of
              | physical, psychological and moral energy together with their knowledge of social
              | relations and sociability (…) which they have accumulated throughout the life
              | course” (Delcroix 1999, p. 175). This, however, leads to the question of what hap-
              | pens with difficult, even traumatizing elements, which often characterize precari-
              | ous family histories and life courses. Can they indeed be considered a resource on
              | which youths can draw – or do they constitute an object that cannot be conveyed
              | without overburdening the children? Is it at all useful for parents to relate life sto-
              | ries that reflect a trajectory of suffering (Schütze/Riemann 1991), a phase in life
              | where they were not able to come to terms with the social reality that was inflict-
              | ed upon them? But on the other hand, is it at all possible to not pass them on?
              | We discussed these questions during our participation in a French-German
              | seminar on socialization, gender and migration between professors, researchers,
              | and PhD candidates. This led us also to reflect on the concept of transmission and
              | how it could help us understand the diverse phenomena we encountered during
              | our fieldwork.
              | In the following text we refer to a dynamic notion of intergenerational trans-
              | mission and not just a vertical or one-way relationship. According to Bernard La-
              | hire, who studied the configurations that allow the transmission of parents’ cul-
              | tural capital in working class families particularly in relation with school, we have
              | to keep in mind that transmission depends on many exterior factors (Lahire, 1995,
              | p. 274). In the two cases presented herein, this requires us to question any notion
              | of transmission that neglects “the work, the appropriation and construction done
              | by the ‘apprentice’ or the ‘heir’” (Lahire 1995, p. 277). To describe this process,

text          | Inowlocki coined the term generational work in her research with families of for-
              | mer Jewish displaced persons, in which the middle and younger generation active-
              | ly produced continuity by “trying to know and understand about oneself and one
              | another through each other” (Inowlocki 2013, pp. 30, 41). She develops this con-
              | cept in her analysis of scenes of personal interaction between family members, but
              | even if this should not be possible anymore, the younger generations can still car-
              | ry out generational work by reflecting and reinterpreting interactions with the
              | older generations. We postulate with Déchaux, that there is an “elective link to
              | the line” (Déchaux 2007, p. 92) that attributes an active role to the “heirs” in the
              | reinterpretation of the content of what has been transmitted. But if it seems per-
              | tinent to question the notion of transmission in precarious environments, can we
              | talk about what Attias-Donfut and Wolff (2009, p. 28) call “le désenchaînement
              | des générations,” a generational rupture or disconnection with which the children
              | of migrants are confronted, meaning they are “facing a destiny they have to con-
              | struct all by themselves”?
              | The following analysis of two case studies (in part II.) will reveal some unex-
              | pected dynamics regarding the questions outlined above. We present two cases of
              | intergenerational transmission of trajectories of suffering – or trauma1 – in what
              | can be called precarious environments, albeit in very different contexts: the
              | French system of fostering institutions and a refugee camp in the West Bank. In
              | both cases, the previous generation had migrated before our interviewees were
              | born; but in the first case, the migration of the older generation is contextualized
              | by French migration policies and the country’s economic need for labor power,
              | while in the case situated in Palestine, the older generation fled out of fear of po-
              | litical violence or was in fact expelled. We are aware that both cases differ in more
              | than in this aspect: the data material consists in the first case of an individual bi-
              | ographical interview, in the second case of consecutive group interviews. More-
              | over, the interviewees are of a very different age at the time of the interview: in
              | the first case it is a woman of 58 years who by now is a mother herself; in the sec-
              | ond case they are young people aged 14 to 21.
              | Given that our cases differ in a variety of aspects, our idea is not to compare
              | our two cases in the strict sense, but rather to discuss them in their similarities
              | and differences regarding processes of intergenerational transmission. This point
              | of view allows us to understand the “how” rather than the “why” (Becker 1998)
              | and to gain an understanding of the processes that are in the background of our
              | two cases of intergenerational transmission in a precarious environment.
              | Furthermore, discussing these two cases side by side was at first merely helpful
              | for finding out more about each respective individual case. But we soon realized
              | that both cases have more in common than one would suspect at first sight by as-
              | sessing their external criteria.
              | In the ensuing discussion (3) we will reflect upon the common structural dy-
              | namics and differences of both cases. However, we are aware that this discussion
              | is testing the limits of casing and comparing. Therefore, in the conclusion (4) we
              | will reflect upon the results but also upon more general questions of “comparabil-
              | ity” and casing, and the pitfalls and opportunities that comparisons of such differ-
              | ent cases imply.

              | ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77
              | On the premise that “[...] a case becomes the opportunity to discover knowledge
              | about how it is both specific to and representative of a larger phenomenon” (Wie-
              | viorka 1992, p. 170), we here present two case studies in which we found some in-
              | teresting elements concerning the process of transmission. The first case study
              | (2.1.) results from Sarra Chaïeb’s research project on the experiences of members
              | of minority groups in foster institutions in France, and the second case (2.2.) from
              | Christoph H. Schwarz’s (2014) research on adolescence in a Palestinian refugee
              | camp. In order to better understand the cases, we will at first contextualize both
              | and outline the general research question and methodology.
              | 2.1 Case Study 1: Growing up in French child welfare.
              | By interviewing adults who were fostered during their childhood and adolescence,
              | Sarra Chaïeb’s research tries to understand how members of ethnic or religious
              | minority groups experienced their placement in two child protection organizations
              | that are historically characterized by religion (Judaism and Catholicism). On the
              | one hand, she asks how the two care institutions impact people’s life courses and
              | their sense of belonging, in regard to the socialization in their families. On the
              | other hand, based on interviews with professionals, she explores how individuals
              | and also groups of individuals – groups of migrants, for example – influence or
              | have influenced the evolution of the boundaries and the professional practices of
              | these organizations. The interview with Emma2 was one of those conducted in the
              | exploratory phase of this research, and is one which exposes the main topics that
              | also emerged throughout the subsequent interviews: the sense of belonging, the
              | construction of socialization between the institution and the family and the con-
              | tradictions this can cause, and the place of religion and ethnicity, among others.3
              | The importance of this question is underlined by the growing concern regarding
              | the evaluation of public policies, which tries to understand which resources can
              | help fostered children and which constraints can burden them (Delcroix 2005).
              | Despite the existing research on this question presenting a wide array of method-
              | ologies and samples, and even though it involves various disciplines and fields, a
              | small number of recurrent issues crop up time and again (Frechon/Dumaret 2008;
              | Chaïeb 2013): success at school, professional insertion, physical and mental health,
              | and housing, as well as the impact of gender on placement trajectories (Bauer et
              | al. 1993; Dumaret/Coppel-Batsch 1995; Frechon 2003; 2009; Dumaret, et al. 2009;
              | Potin 2009, 2012; Stein/Dumaret 2011).
              | Compared to other countries (Thoburn/Chand/Procter 2005)4, the specific ques-
              | tion of the fostered children’s cultural or religious background has only briefly
              | been broached by French research (Gheorghiu 2002). We try to understand the
              | way in which people see their placement trajectory after they have left care, to see
              | how they have structured themselves in this context, in which resources they have
              | found support (Castel, 1995), but also what type of socialization they have devel-
              | oped between their family and the institution in which they have been placed. In-
              | terpretations are thus based on their related memory. Using life stories seems to
              | be the most appropriate way to understand these types of data. For Daniel Ber-
              | S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories
meta          | 61
text          | taux (2005, p. 36), “there is life story when a subject tells to another person, a re-
              | searcher or not, any episode from his lived experience,” which allows us not to
              | “impose a standardized interview” onto people, and to give them “the time and
              | place to tell their own story,” (Burawoy 2003, p. 436). Formerly fostered persons
              | enter in what D. Bertraux (2005, p. 21) calls “categories de situation“ because it is
              | the situation itself that is common; they all passed a certain phase of their life
              | course being fostered.
              | Concerning the institutional situation, it seems obvious that the family, after a
              | certain period of fostering, does not play the role of most important agent of social-
              | ization and intergenerational transmission anymore. Instead, the fostering insti-
              | tution appears to take the parents’ place in the everyday life of the children and
              | youths. This idea leads to more questions: in the context of fostering, is there a
              | sort of institutional intergenerational transmission, too? Does the transmission
              | necessarily come from the family? What about the “plural kinship” (Cadoret 1995)
              | in the framework of foster care? In our case, and referring to the conceptual con-
              | siderations above, one might ask, which are the contents of intergenerational
              | transmission that are appropriated by Emma? What would parents transmit to
              | their children in a context of fostering? What is the link between transmission and
              | re-appropriation in this case? These dimensions can be considered regarding the
              | conflict and/or the idea of “plural socialization” (Lahire 1998) that foster children
              | are more likely to face. The case presented in the following, Emma’s life story, is
              | an example of such a life course.
              | 2.1.1 Emma: Elements of her life course
              | Emma is a 58-year-old woman. She is married and lives with her husband in their
              | house near Paris. They have three children who are between 20 and 30 years old.
              | She has been a nurse since the age of 27.
              | Emma was fostered again and again during her youth, often during short peri-
              | ods when her mother gave birth to Emma’s brothers and sisters. Emma is the eld-
              | est of a family of eleven children, and was born in Tunisia when the country was
              | still a French protectorate. Her mother is Kabyle Algerian. Her father, a Tunisian,
              | fought for France during the Second World War, in which he was wounded. He ar-
              | rived in France around 1955, when the country recruited immigrants as cheap
              | workers. He was housed, among other immigrant workers, in southern French
              | shanty towns, before he moved to the first public housing built for migrant work-
              | ers. Emma and her mother, who had stayed in Tunisia until that time, rejoined
              | him in France after 3 years. He subjected Emma to abuse and physical violence.
              | Her mother did not intervene, as a result of which Emma felt betrayed by her. The
              | successive pregnancies of her mother led to Emma’s frequent fostering, and by the
              | age of 10, she had already been fostered for 2 to 4 years in a children’s house, be-
              | cause of poor housing and malnutrition at home, and to prevent tuberculosis.
              | From the age of 10 to 14 years, Emma lived in a placement institution. At the
              | age of 15 she returned home, where she was again subjected to extreme violence
              | by her father to the point where he tried to kill her. He also battered her brothers.
              | But now, as an adolescent, she decided to press charges against him. In the trial,
              | her father was sentenced to 30 years in prison, whereas she was transferred to
              | another foster place, this time a religious institution. There, she was subjected to
              | sexual abuse by a priest. Furthermore, she was always rejected by other children
              | and continuously insulted as a “dirty Arab.” To escape from this situation, she de-

              | cided to run away from the foster institution just before she turned 21; she also at-
              | tempted suicide, but survived. Her later meeting with a social worker allowed her
              | to find a job. Later on she returned to school and graduated in nursing in 1980.
              | 2.1.2 The transmission viewed as a constraint during fostering
              | In Emma’s case, the difficulty concerning intergenerational transmission seems to
              | be situated on two main levels: firstly, her story raises the question whether, in-
              | side her family, a family memory was actually developed and passed on. Secondly,
              | which elements could be reinterpreted to keep a trace, an inheritance in this cha-
              | otic life course?
              | For a long time, Emma was ashamed of her family and of where she came from.
              | At the beginning, all the suffering that her parents subjected her to did not allow
              | her to refer to her family in any positive way. For Emma, everything seemed to be
              | negative and destructive.
              | Emma: And after all these questions, there is everything that goes into pieces, and you
              | ask yourself “Why all this?” You don’t want to be a victim, you say to yourself,
              | “I’m sick of all that, I have to assume,” but you’re always ashamed, it’s very
              | strong. I was sometimes making up a story, not to say where I come from. I was
              | tempted to believe that my father was a big man in the army, that my mother
              | was the daughter of a tribal chief, you know, just for fun, to think that they were
              | nice people… After that, I told myself that it wasn’t the point, anyway I would
              | never be like that.
              | Here Emma expresses the shame she felt, and explains the temptation of trying to
              | fend off this shame. This period seems to be difficult for her; she does not want to
              | be in the line of her parents’ descent. But even though the negligence, mistreat-
              | ment and violence she experienced from her parents reappear in Emma’s memory,
              | she later on developed something in common with them, some specific memories
              | which are mentioned in her talks. A part of what has been passed on to her was
              | hard to accept for a while: her face, first name and surname are visible traces of
              | what she represents for people. We can see in this interview extract that Emma
              | had experiences of racist discrimination at different moments in her life course.
              | The differentiated treatment (Cossée/Lada/Rigoni 2004; Chaïeb/Cossée 2013) she
              | was confronted with – to be considered just as Arab while she just wanted to be
              | “as the other,” – can partially explain the reason why Emma has so much difficul-
              | ty to accept herself as Arab.
              | Emma: […] it’s true, I always loved my job, it was all I could do to prove to humanity
              | that I could do something good, because during all this time, even during the in-
              | ternships, people considered me a dirty Arab. In so far that I sometimes treat
              | myself as a dirty Arab too although I never recognized myself as Arab. Quickly I
              | changed my first name, when they asked where I come from. I couldn’t say that I
              | was Tunisian, because for me it was the reflection of my father and my mother
              | […] But it’s true that I was thinking that maybe on my deathbed I will find the
              | courage to take my maiden name again and use it with pride.
              | Thus, Emma sent a strong signal by changing her name and gaining some dis-
              | tance from her family history. After that, she explains the joy she felt when she
              | took her husband’s name, which made her life easier, in particular when she was
              | looking for a job. She felt protected from people’s opinions but also from what she
              | disclosed about herself. Emma did not recognize herself in other people’s regard
              | and could not consider herself as a part of her parents’ cultural origin.
              | S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories
meta          | 63
text          | The question of her parents’ origin seems to be one of the most important and
              | strong issues for Emma because it is central to her identity construction and her
              | relation to others. It is impossible to override this set of problems, precisely for
              | these two reasons. But how could one feel engaged in a positive intergenerational
              | relation with one’s parents, their values, traditions and general cultural frame,
              | when these elements are distorted by a violent climate of mistreatment? Emma’s
              | speech reflects this ambivalence very well: on the one hand, the paradox consists
              | in dismissing the elements that could lead to her origins, because she does not
              | identify with them. On the other hand, she describes a possible “return to origins”
              | – in this case reverting to her real first name – as an act of bravery.
              | 2.1.3 The re-interpretation of fostering as a strategy to link with family
              | transmission
              | In Emma’s case, there seem to be two main aspects which come into play when
              | she reinterprets what has been passed on: time and the necessity to draft her own
              | life and her concept of self. Emma needed time to take a different look at how she
              | suffered, and building her own family was significant for the reinterpretation of
              | her life course. Studies on fostering often deal with the dimension of time: the
              | more time has passed after leaving the care institution, the more people can take
              | a global view on their fostering and develop resilience (Frechon/Dumaret 2008, p.
              | 8; Stein 2006, p. 7).
              | Time is indeed an important factor in the interpretation of events that punctu-
              | ated her life, and Emma succeeds in describing her life course from a positive
              | point of view despite what she went through. For a long time, Emma felt resent-
              | ment against her mother. Later, however, she speaks about the mother-daughter
              | relationship as not very developed, but as playing an important role in her life
              | course and the tenacity she found in herself:
              | Emma: I arrived after a tragedy, it was hard, but I hope… I think that she loved me. I
              | don’t know if she wanted me but nevertheless she took me in her arms. I think
              | that someone who copes, who isn’t mentally ill, who doesn’t commit suicide,
              | maybe such a person was, for the two or three first years of her life, touched,
              | kissed, liked… for me, if you had that, you can come to terms with all uproar, you
              | will always be better off than someone who didn’t have that.
              | Here Emma manages to point out the positive elements that her parents passed
              | on to her, or at least she can see something positive in these elements. According
              | to her interpretation, the fact that she has been able to cope despite all the hard-
              | ship counts as proof that the past cannot have been all bad, that at least in her
              | early childhood her mother must have loved her and have cared for her. All these
              | elements form part of the construction of family memory, even though the frame-
              | work in which they evolve does not coincide with the norms of a “normal family.”
              | Time is fundamental for a possible construction, deconstruction and reconstruc-
              | tion of a family memory that is passed on, and it is “beyond the individual [that]
              | fits in the movements of continuity and movements of rupture of families’ story, in
              | families’ links, in forms of transmission and in the content of inheritance.” There
              | is also a necessary work for each of us, beginning from what was passed on, to ar-
              | rive at “be yourself.” The family memory, according to A. Muxel (2007, p. 10), has
              | three functions: “a transmission function, in the continuity of a family story, and
              | attached to perpetuate the particularisms” (2007, p. 13); “a regeneration [revivis-
meta          | 64
text          | ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77
              | cence] function which allows to stage memories of childhood time and family life”
              | (2007, p. 23); “a reflexivity function: it consists in learning about family experi-
              | ence, have a distant view over the past, the circumstances and persons who made
              | you, do a temporary making-up of oneself destiny” (2007, p. 30).
              | In Emma’s life course, the transmission and reflexivity functions go together,
              | because she is in perpetual questioning of past events. It took a long time to ac-
              | cept what she experienced, the difficulties she went through, and the destructive
              | relationship between her parents and herself. When she speaks about her broth-
              | ers and sisters, she considers that they have not yet managed to take the plunge
              | in the comprehension of this family story. For her, there are two steps of recon-
              | struction: the search for a guilty person and the attempt to understand the rea-
              | sons for what happened. The dimension of social supports and/or of people who
              | play the role of resource in the life course is very important in Emma’s trajectory
              | as a fostered person (Goyette 2006; Frechon/Goyette 2013). When she was young,
              | Emma met adults who became significant others, such as her school teacher who
              | took on an almost maternal relation towards her. The fact that Emma speaks
              | about her teacher in a vocabulary of love, as the love she did not have from her
              | mother, might indicate that this relation compensated for some of the lack of af-
              | fection on her mother’s part.
              | Emma desperately seeks information about her parents and their life course.
              | Paradoxically, it is the very lack of information that increasingly becomes a re-
              | source for her. After all these years of hatred towards her mother, today Emma
              | believes that her current objective may be to avenge her mother as a woman. Ac-
              | cording to Emma, her mother never had a chance in life: she did not have the
              | choice to marry or to control her body. Emma defines her life course as a struggle
              | against injustice, especially against men, and feels involved in a mission:
              | Emma: […] I am on trial. I had problems with all the men I met in my life… and then I
              | put them on trial, so this means there is something wrong. I’m in a woman’s re-
              | volt against men. As if by chance, from my father, to the educators, clergy, em-
              | ployers, it’s always men, so maybe I rebel against that, or maybe it is the rebel-
              | lion of my mother that she couldn’t realize so I’m stuck with all that.
              | Emma here tackles her female rebellion as the result of a mother-to-daughter
              | transmission, even though this might not have been her mother’s conscious inten-
              | tion. She actively (re)constructs what her mother experienced as a woman, appro-
              | priating these experiences herself, applying them to her biographical process, and
              | striving for continuity. Emma explains everything about her life story, her moth-
              | er’s difficulty to be a subject of her own life, not just because she did not have in-
              | tellectual resources, but because she did not have any access to the information
              | that would have been useful in a precarious social and cultural context. Hence,
              | she theorizes and attributes the basis of this rebellion to her mother. Emma, by
              | contrast, succeeds in being independent. Even if she speaks a lot about her bad re-
              | lationships with men in general, we can note that she found such a balance with
              | her husband, with whom she feels independent; she seems to have escaped from a
              | certain pattern of relationships. Another important departure from her mother’s
              | story is her job, which in Emma’s narration is depicted as a particularly important
              | resource for her independence and emancipation.
              | Emma: My real freedom, it was when I succeed to graduate at 27; before this moment, I
              | was still under the yoke of authority … the authority of the man from whom I
              | rent my room, and the employer.[…] I keep all my work experience records, be-
              | S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories
meta          | 65
text          | cause it’s really my pride to get recognition. Wherever I was, I did not have any
              | value for people, an Arab, a thief, a violent person, so I showed off my abilities,
              | because before they were buried. The more I succeeded, the more I found some
              | self-esteem.
              | This case illustrates the concept of transmission and allows us to think of this no-
              | tion as a dynamic one. As a case of an “extreme situation” of transmission (Ber-
              | taux 1997), it can challenge the notion and point to some new dimensions. We can
              | see that Emma finds a dimension of transmission from her mother in her life
              | course in spite of how her mother acted towards her. Taking an active part in re-
              | interpretation seems to be very important in the case of transmission in this pre-
              | carious environment.
              | 2.2 Case Study 2: Growing up in a Palestinian refugee camp
              | This second case study is based on Christoph H. Schwarz’ (2014) research on the
              | structure of potential spaces of adolescence (King 2002) in Palestinian refugee
              | camps in the West Bank. In the West Bank there are 19 of these camps, and an-
              | other 40 Palestinian refugee camps are scattered throughout Gaza, Jordan, Syria
              | and Lebanon. The socioeconomic and political situations in these camps differ
              | from one another, depending on each camp’s relation with the respective political
              | regime and the juridical status it has granted the refugees. But despite the local
              | differences all of these camps seem to provide particularly illustrative cases of the
              | intergenerational transmission of a refugee identity and the concomitant political
              | narrative.
              | The first generation of the inhabitants of the refugee camps shares a predomi-
              | nantly peasant background. Originally, the camps were established under the
              | auspices of international humanitarian organizations in 1948 in order to give
              | shelter to the approximately 750 000 refugees that fled or were expelled during
              | the course of the first Arab-Israeli war, which in Jewish-Israeli discourse is called
              | the War of Independence, whereas in the Arabic discourse it is referred to by the
              | term Nakba (catastrophe in Arabic) (Sayigh 1979, pp. 6ff.; Bowker 2003, pp. 67ff.).
              | However, using the term “camp” already seems misleading here, as it is usually
              | associated with tents. Today, these camps can better be described as “concrete-
              | structured slum neighborhoods on the peripheries of cities” (Morris 2004, p. 1),
              | which in many cases are difficult to distinguish from the neighboring cities as
              | they merge with their fringes. Nevertheless, three generations after the Nakba,
              | the perpetual reference of the term “camp” is accurate insofar as it reflects the po-
              | litical and social paradox that the camp is still defined as a transitory space, and
              | that expressions of the collective intention to “return” are omnipresent in murals
              | and statements. In contradiction to this, however, there is the everyday individual
              | need to come to terms with the current situation and the attempts to improve it,
              | which finds its expression in the construction of three- or four-story apartment
              | houses in the camps. This paradox also characterizes the United Nations Relief
              | and Works Agency (UNRWA), which can be considered an international institu-
              | tional framework for passing on the refugee identity and the respective collective
              | memory: UNRWA’s definition of “Palestinian refugees” includes the children and
              | grandchildren of those who had to flee in 1948, so that, due to the demographic
              | development, the more time passes since the Nakba the more persons are defined
meta          | 66
text          | ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77
              | as Palestinian refugees. By now, the agency counts approximately 5 million Pales-
              | tinian refugees (Schiff 1995; Bowker 2003; Schwarz 2012b).5
              | Some authors claim that the refugees’ “livelihoods have stabilized after three
              | generations and their basic living conditions resemble those of the host country
              | populations” (Hanssen-Bauer/Blome Jacobsen 2007, p. 29). However, the living
              | conditions in these densely populated areas are difficult, showing unemployment
              | rates above the respective national average, albeit a higher-than-average quality
              | of education provided in UNRWA schools; they constitute precarious environ-
              | ments with limited perspectives for inhabitants and for future generations. As
              | other refugee camps worldwide, they have been in the center of armed confronta-
              | tions again and again.6
              | 2.2.1 The affirmation of intergenerational continuity
              | The data material presented here is the result of ethno-analytic group interviews7
              | conducted from 2008 to 2011 in one of the refugee camps in the West Bank, most-
              | ly with members of a youth folklore and theatre group. In their shows these
              | youths combine political theatre with dabka, an ubiquitous Arab folk dance in the
              | Levant. The cultural center where they practice – called Markaz8 here – provides
              | several community services and is at the same time a meeting point for interna-
              | tional visitors who want to get an impression of the situation of Palestinian refu-
              | gees – for example by taking guided tours through the camp – or who are engag-
              | ing in projects of Palestine solidarity networks.
              | The participants in the first group interview were four boys and seven girls
              | aged 15 to 19 years, together with their trainer, 20-year-old Adnan. In the begin-
              | ning the youths were asked to talk about the history of their group, and how they
              | got to know each other. The first one to answer was one of the girls, Yasmeen (15),
              | who introduced the group as the “fifth generation” of the Markaz Dabka Troupe.
              | With this explicit reference to the term “generation” she directly located the group
              | not only in the cultural center but also in a particular intergenerational relation-
              | ship. It turned out later that the youths are being trained by the “fourth genera-
              | tion” of the group (of around 20 years of age, like Adnan) and they themselves act
              | as trainers of the “sixth generation,” that is, children of approximately 8‒12 years
              | of age. By this, they reproduce the transmission of the refugee identity and the
              | militant struggle for “return” among the three generations of refugees, which one
              | of the boys, 16-year-old Maher, described later in this interview:
              | Maher: And you know here, the revo-, the revolution, the struggle, it’s moved from gen-
              | eration to generation. Yeah. (...) Yeah, the big man is give like his gun or his-, his
              | thing to his child. And his child will do the same, you know? Like for me, my fa-
              | ther told me that there is a revo-, revolution and don’t forget Palestine and you
              | have to struggle, you have to do something, and the situation here is... you have
              | to do something. Because we live in a... a camp, we have friends in the prison, we
              | have friends who’s died, yeah. And ‒, and this thing do that ‒, that you have to ...
              | to struggle, yeah.
              | Looking at structure and content of this passage from a perspective of Fritz
              | Schütze’s (1977, 1983) text sort differentiation9, Maher reports what his father told
              | him about the ongoing “revolution,” he does not contextualize this conversation in
              | a particular situation. No particular place or point in time is mentioned, the in-
              | teraction is less described as a relevant one-time experience than as everyday

meta          | 67
text          | practice; this, in turn, can be interpreted as an indicator of the ubiquity of the
              | narrative in the camp. Moreover, Maher does not mention his own reaction to his
              | father’s demand, it does not appear as a vocal interaction but as a message that is
              | received and accepted, giving the impression of a vertical, one-way direction of
              | transmission. Accordingly, he presents an argumentation: “you have to struggle,
              | you have to do something” because of the fact that they live in a camp, that
              | “friends,” supposedly of his own generation, died or were serving prison sentences
              | – both presumably because of confrontations with the Israeli security forces. How-
              | ever, although the concrete means of “struggle” to which the group refers are not
              | outlined so far, the demand to struggle here was described as an almost “natural”
              | or logical result of the situation. Still, the argumentative form seems to indicate a
              | certain social pressure to engage in the struggle, a pressure that is not only
              | passed on by the older generation but also exerted within peer relationships.
              | This argumentative mode also characterized the following course of the inter-
              | view, when Maher and Adnan took turns in presenting long statements, talking
              | about the general situation at the checkpoints, the imprisonment of minors etc.
              | Sometimes these statements also referred to their own practice as a dabka group,
              | which the interviewer was able to attend later. In these shows, the youths com-
              | bine folkloric dance and music with theatre playing, but the actors would not ar-
              | ticulate any monologues or dialogues, or sing songs themselves, which might have
              | given the performance or the enacted character a more individual or personal
              | touch. Instead, the narration that went along with the show came from a recorded
              | CD, just like the music, and the actors would dance and perform to it. The youths
              | enacted the Nakba and the ongoing political and militant struggle against Israel.
              | Moreover, they enacted the transmission of the mission to “return” from the older
              | to the younger generation: in the respective scene, one of the actors would die as a
              | martyr on stage and in his last words – again, from the CD, with underlying mu-
              | sic – would confer to his son the mission to never give up the land and to fight for
              | it, stating that it was the most precious and meaningful asset on earth – a mission
              | the son willingly accepted and re-enacted, with the other actors rising, joining in,
              | everybody raising their fists.
              | But in spite of this militant presentation the youths affirmed already in this
              | first interview that “throwing stones” had not had the desired political effect, but
              | had only put the youth at risk. In the same vein, Adnan had at one point dis-
              | tanced himself explicitly from suicide bombing – “I’m not with them!” he reiterat-
              | ed twice10 – and declared that their mission as a youth group was to carry on the
              | struggle “in a new way,” by informing about the situation of the Palestinian refu-
              | gees on an international level; and like this, he added, “the kids” would also “see
              | other countries.” In the following he went back to the issue of the tours Yasmeen
              | had mentioned in the beginning of the interview, and put them in a much more
              | political context:
              | Adnan: For the new generation everything is, that means11, is changed. In the past you
              | didn’t have just one solution, just to fight. Now, I can ‒, by dabka troupe, I can
              | change, I can by, uh, our education I can change, I can change by a lot of ways.
              | Like for me and for them, we enter Markaz [CHS: Hmhm.], we enter the dabka
              | troupe and I remember the-, the president of... ah, not the president, the presi-
              | dent of ‒, ah... (…) For biiig ‒, for big center [presumably another cultural center,
              | CHS], they told-, they told us (clears his throat), I mean, you are 16, aaah, 16
              | kids, you visited Canada just for three weeks and really, really, you change, you
              | change... like the govern ‒, the Palestinian government in twenty years. (...) This

              | is the good thing. Not just to fight, not just to ‒, to ‒, told the people “We need
              | that, and we need that and we need that.” I changed how the people, they think
              | about us, there. This is the good thing, good. I mean, if the revo ‒, if the revolu-
              | tion happen again ... maybe I accept and I agree with them. But I must tell them
              | there is a lot of ways.
              | Maher, in the passage cited earlier, referred to the term “generation” in order to
              | stress the continuity in the process of intergenerational transmission of the strug-
              | gle, whereas Adnan very clearly highlights the differences between generations
              | when he states that for the new generation, “everything is changed”. He contrasts
              | “the past”, when one could only fight, to the current situation and to his activities
              | as a trainer for the dabka troupe. Moreover, he relates an encounter in which, as
              | it seems, a president of another cultural center praises and compliments the
              | group for its achievements through their cultural activity and their contribution
              | to the national struggle. However, what starts as a situation of praise and com-
              | pliment in Adnan’s narration soon turns into an act of argumentative justifica-
              | tion: When the revolution “happens again,” Adnan has to decide if he “accepts and
              | agrees with them” (without further explanation who he refers to as “them”). His
              | acceptance on principle granted, he argues that “there is a lot of ways,” which he
              | has described before as theatre playing and education. He thereby declares his es-
              | sential identification with “the revolution” but at the same time the possibility –
              | and the individual right – to choose how to support the struggle. Whereas Adnan
              | describes the past shortly as a trajectory of suffering – characterized by a loss of
              | control that leaves no option but “to fight” – the present seems to give more lee-
              | way for strategic reflection. Accordingly, one can assume that dabka serves indeed
              | as another form of resistance in the asymmetric conflict with Israel, in the sense
              | of claiming a cultural presence and continuity and advocating for the political pro-
              | ject of “return.” On a psychological level, it might help the youths to deal with po-
              | litical violence they experienced directly (although none of that is mentioned
              | here); moreover, it might serve as a means to deal with trajectory experiences of
              | displacement that were passed on by the older generation. However, it becomes
              | more and more obvious that their dabka practice also serves to broker intergener-
              | ational and inter-factional power relations within their own community, as the fol-
              | lowing paragraph will illustrate in more detail.
              | 2.2.2 Adolescent strategies of re-interpretation
              | In the course of the subsequent interviews, which were conducted without Adnan,
              | and mostly gender-separated, the youths were willing to talk about more personal
              | questions, such as love or familial relations (Schwarz 2012a). Whereas in the first
              | interview the camp community was presented as a family-like community show-
              | ing solidarity to all of its members, in these subsequent interviews, boys as well as
              | girls soon complained about the sexual repression and social control in the camp,
              | stating that everybody would gossip and ruin the respective girl’s reputation, and
              | that parents would react with severe punishment. They namely blamed the more
              | conservative or religious factions in the camp as responsible for this situation, and
              | described the dabka group and the cultural center as potential spaces in a hostile
              | environment, and as the most important places where boys and girls could meet
              | without being controlled (there are, by the way, hardly any co-educative schools in
              | Palestine, and the UNRWA schools are no exception). All the youths expressed
              | their hope that their own children might grow up without such social control, in
              | S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories
meta          | 69
text          | more “liberal” circumstances. They often referred to the situation of youths in the
              | “Western” countries (Northern America, Europe) as a model. This, in turn, sheds
              | new light on their symbolic militancy – because it is precisely their role as politi-
              | cal representatives that allows them to travel as a gender-mixed adolescent group
              | (only looked after by members of the third or fourth “generation” of the group) and
              | in fact to create a temporary space beyond the crowded confinements of the camp
              | without the social control of their parents or the conservative factions of the camp
              | community. Taking into account that travels in general are a very adolescent mo-
              | tive, their trips to foreign countries and the contact with foreign cultures and life
              | projects of other adolescents represent an important “potential space of adoles-
              | cence” (King 2002), because it allows them a certain reflective distance from which
              | to view the circumstances and moral values of their community, and Palestinian
              | society in general.
              | In one of the later interviews, the girls also referred to what their grandparents
              | had told them about the Nakba. They stressed that their grandparents had kept
              | the keys to their houses to this day. Departing from this topic, they continued to
              | discuss their own hopes for “return” in a much more skeptical way than as pre-
              | sented in their shows, or in the first interview:
              | Aziza/Jamila: Yeah.
              | Jamila:
              | CHS:
              | Aziza:
              | Jamila:
              | CHS:
              | Nadia:
              | Aziza:
              | Jamila:
              | Aziza:
              | And they have the keys ‘til the ‒, (in a low voice) ’til this day.
              | That’s what I was about to ask... do they still have the keys?
              | But there’s no home (smiles) \ [CHS: Alright.] or no-, nothing there!
              | It’s just the keys. (giggles)
              | \ (smiles) It’s destroyed!
              | So talk to me about the keys. What ‒, what do they mean?
              | Hope... That they...they have the keys of their homes, so... [Jamila: ~~~] they
              | think that they will come back soon. [CHS: Hmhm.] They come back//
              | Maybe not-, not-, eh, not-, ((ours)), how do you say that?
              | Not ours.
              | Not our hope, like.. I mean, the keys.. (clicks her tongue, smiles) I don’t know,
              | because, ehm... (to another girl) go ahead, speak! (smiles) our Engl-, [CHS: Speak
              | in Arabic if you want.] our grand ‒, grand ‒, what? [Jamila: Parents.] Yeah. They
              | ju ‒, they just have the hope. I don’t have the hope, [CHS: Hmhm.] like them... I
              | have but ‒, not like//
              | Nadia:
              | Not the same hope like they do... they have. [Aziza: Yeah.]
              | In this passage, the hope to return is symbolized by the keys their parents or
              | grandparents still keep – objects of memory that will be passed on to the younger
              | generation, just like it is presented in political murals, slogans and songs, which
              | campaign for the “right of return.” Here, however, the keys are presented as
              | something that is not relevant for the girls’ situation as adolescents or for their
              | life projects. At some point they even seem to ridicule and laugh about their
              | grandparents’ hope, which might indicate that among themselves these hopes are
              | also a target of a certain aggressiveness towards the older generation. This, in
              | turn, is seen by some authors as characteristic of an adolescent detachment nec-
              | essary to reach autonomy and construct one’s own life project (Blos 1962; Erdheim
              | 1982; Bosse 1994). Apparently, there are two very different “hopes for return,” and
              | their own project of return, which they so fervently defended in previous inter-

text          | ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77
              | views, once more seems to differ a great deal from the old generation’s concepts.
              | But after this passage, the girls discussed in an argumentative manner that the
              | connection of their grandparents to the villages was stronger because they had ac-
              | tually lived there. 14 year old Nadia – the youngest of the girls – in the end gave a
              | conclusion, which, again, stressed generational differences, but was characterized
              | by empathy for their grandparents and for their hopes described as futile before:
              | Nadia: They’re old, they can’t just, you know... ~~~ ((leave it behind))
              | Jamila:
              | (giggles)
              | Here it seems like she wants to make the interviewer understand their grandpar-
              | ents’ condition, while Jamila is still giggling. Then again, in a later passage Nadia
              | stated:
              | Nadia: They told us to keep fighting, but there are ways of fighting, you know? Like,
              | ahm, I don’t have to hold a stone and threw it at them to say that I’m fighting.
              | (…) Eh, we can study and learn (…) many things and this is how we... can fight.
              | Or dancing dabka...
              | Statements like this one, which recall Adnan’s argumentation cited above, came
              | up quite often in the interviews, and were generally supported by the group,
              | which indicates a high relevance for the speakers and a kind of collective strategy
              | in situations of justification. Such argumentations implicitly indicate that the re-
              | alization of each individual life project in one way or another has to refer to this
              | collective narrative – otherwise, individuation would be considered betrayal. In
              | her last statement, Nadia once more emphasizes that the youths refuse to stick to
              | “traditional” ways of fighting, which – last but not least – might endanger their
              | lives, their health and their freedom to a much greater extent than dancing dab-
              | ka. Nadia does not mention more militant actions here, but her description is rem-
              | iniscent of a general political situation that has long been characterized by the
              | veneration for martyrs or Intifada fighters who are perpetually invoked as heroes
              | and paragons in the Palestinian public. Here, this (self-) destructive kind of
              | “fighting” is contrasted with the youths’ ways of fighting: even before the mention-
              | ing of dabka, which is still a collective cultural practice that is directly linked to
              | the construction of Palestinian traditions, Nadia refers to studying and learning,
              | activities that can be used for a variety of reasons and for the realization of very
              | individual life projects.
              | Taking into account that the whole “first generation” of the dabka troupe has
              | migrated, and by now lives and works in foreign countries, one can conclude that
              | the group might in some manner implicitly prepare for migration projects; the
              | narrative of “return” in this case appears as a framework through which intergen-
              | erational (and inter-factional) conflicts are being brokered, and the youths’ adoles-
              | cent strategy in this framework is to appropriate and re-interpret the narrative.
              | They are partly allowed to actually abandon the collective project of “return” if
              | they pay tribute to it by actively reproducing and embodying it on a cultural and
              | symbolic level.12

text          | Discussion
              | The case studies presented here both offer examples of processes of intergenera-
              | tional transmission of trajectory experiences in precarious places. During the
              | analysis of the interviews it became clear that precariousness in these cases not
              | only refers to economic aspects, but also to the fact that the interviewees grew up
              | in places that are defined as anomalous by their societies and by themselves. Be-
              | ing in these places means that “something went wrong.” Therefore, our interview-
              | ees feel more compelled than others to deal with the question of where they come
              | from, where they belong, and where they might go, and to retrospectively make
              | sense of their family histories. With respect to the refugee camp and its dire con-
              | ditions of living, one could assume that – in accordance with Delcroix (1999, 2009)
              | – the narrative (or myth) of struggle and return is one of the few resources par-
              | ents can pass on to their children. It allows them to make sense of the current sit-
              | uation and explain this very precariousness, and it might serve to symbolize how
              | much more parents would have liked to pass on to their children: houses, homes
              | and opportunities that now lie behind the Israeli border. If their children or
              | grandchildren overtly turned them down by not accepting the narratives’ concomi-
              | tant mission, it might be devastating for the elders. The aspects of this transmis-
              | sion are two-fold: on the symbolic level it refers to their parents’ identity construc-
              | tions as Palestinian refugees and acknowledges their trajectory experiences of suf-
              | fering; on an institutional level the narrative embodies their claims to UNRWA
              | and to the international community, which provide important services in a precar-
              | ious situation.
              | In the situation of fostered children in France, the question of transmission is
              | crucial because of the role the institution of care plays, as it replaces the family,
              | and because of the importance of the fostering institution in the life course. In
              | Emma’s case, the family history that she (re-) constructed all by herself, and her
              | fantasies about the relation to her mother in her early childhood years appear as
              | biographical resources that enable her to make sense of her current situation, and
              | to develop and maintain agency. Institutional violence she had to come to terms
              | with during fostering led her to conceive herself as a fighter, and moreover, in-
              | volved her in a political struggle for gender equality. Furthermore, some of the
              | people who offered social support allowed her to (re-) construct herself. At first
              | sight, the most important entity of intergenerational transmission in this case ap-
              | pears to be the foster institution that replaces the family. However, it was precise-
              | ly by reconstructing her family narrative that Emma was enabled to gain a reflex-
              | ive distance from this institution and to pursue a process of further individuation.
              | Simultaneously, she engages in a process of politicization of her own case, as she
              | deals with the power relations at the intersection of migration/racism and patriar-
              | chal oppression, and defines them as the central theme of her life story.
              | However, for our discussion, the most important difference between both cases
              | seems to be the level of explicitness and grade of symbolization of transmission.
              | These aspects obviously determine the respective strategies of the interviewees
              | and the character of their generational work: in Emma’s case, the content of famil-
              | ial transmission appears unclear and has to be reconstructed all by herself,
              | whereas in the case of the dabka group, the transmitted narrative permeates all
              | aspects of life, imposes a very explicit political project onto the younger genera-
              | tion, and functions as a myth, in the sense that it offers ready-made explanations

              | for everyday life. Albeit very different in structure and context, in both cases the
              | processes of intergenerational transmission and their respective grade of explicit-
              | ness appear as both resources and obstacles and are pervaded by tensions and
              | contradictions. Regarding the dabka group, the paradox apparently consists in the
              | youths re-enacting and paying tribute to the myth, and the more they embody the
              | project of return onstage, the more they are allowed to individuate and in fact di-
              | verge from both myth and collective project when it comes to their own life pro-
              | jects. In this sense, they use the narrative of return as a symbolic resource – not
              | only in the struggle against Israel, but also in intergenerational and inter-
              | factional conflict – in order to create and preserve a potential space of adolescence
              | (King 2002). In Emma’s story the lack of a common language, which does not al-
              | low verbal communication with her parents, and therefore at first appears to be
              | an obstacle, is in retrospect used as a biographic resource, offering a certain lee-
              | way for active re-interpretation of the family history, which in turn is used to
              | come to terms with the traumatizing foster experience. In both cases, re-
              | interpretation is crucial in order to lead one’s own life.

text          | Conclusion
              | Together with Howard Becker and Charles Ragin (1992) we asked ourselves
              | “What is this a case of?” We claim that these are cases of intergenerational trans-
              | mission in precarious places, extreme cases in the sense that in the first the pro-
              | cess of transmission is highly obscure and in the second it is highly explicit. The
              | respective younger generation’s strategies of appropriation of the content that was
              | passed on differ according to this level of symbolization.
              | However, the somewhat abstract notion of “appropriation” and case structure
              | only developed in the course of our discussion of the cases, and it would be difficult
              | to do this “casing” beforehand, before speaking to the interviewees, or merely re-
              | ferring to exterior data. We at first had the impression that our cases differed a
              | great deal when it came to a certain “common denominator” that was yet to be
              | identified and theoretically conceptualized. So, going back even further, to the
              | question “What is a case?” we would claim that, categorizing these cases as cases
              | of intergenerational transmission results from the process of research and discus-
              | sion itself, because of the relevance of the issue for our informants. Our inform-
              | ants implicitly outlined their respective strategies of re-interpretation to us and
              | made use of the interview situation to reflect upon them. Regarding the method-
              | ology for the research on processes of intergenerational transmission, both life sto-
              | ries and ethno-analytic group interviews are examples of very open approaches of
              | “data retrieval,” and it is precisely this openness that might allow interviewees
              | not only to convey, but also to reflect on their experiences, which in turn might re-
              | sult in generational work, if they seek to produce continuity. In Emma’s case, it
              | seems that she made use of the research situation as a potential space in order to
              | interpret or re-interpret experiences that were passed on to her, and to actively re-
              | construct her life story. The intimacy of the life story approach allows Emma to
              | constructively assert a posture of reflexivity. Life story telling allows looking at
              | the process in action, and provides the possibility of understanding the “diachron-

text          | ic dimension” (Bertaux 2005, p. 13) especially of life courses and how processes of
              | intergenerational transmission are embedded therein. The case of the Palestinian
              | youths illustrates the potential of open group interviews in researching how inter-
              | generational transmissions are brokered in adolescent peer groups, and how
              | group dynamics interfere with hegemonic discourses and individual as well as col-
              | lective self-concepts. The weight of the violence suffered by former generations
              | and of the collective myth built in reaction is obvious – however, it becomes also
              | salient to what extent the dynamics of peer groups can constitute a resource for
              | individual development. Here we cannot delve deeper into the development of the
              | research relation, but also in this case the group used the consecutive talks in or-
              | der to discuss norms that before seemed to be taken for granted. In this case, a po-
              | litical mission and a transmitted collective narrative resulting from an asymmet-
              | ric military-political conflict are moreover used to broker a latent conflict between
              | generations; apparently, processes of individuation are only possible if the latter
              | conflict maintains its latent character.
              | Albeit very different regarding their data form, context, and age of the inter-
              | viewees, both cases can serve as contrasting cases in order to map the field of in-
              | tergenerational transmission of trajectories of suffering in precarious environ-
              | ments, and the coping strategies the following generations develop therein. A par-
              | ticular strength of explorative and qualitative research is to find “counter-
              | intuitive cases,” cases that do not fit into the scheme we have expected so far.
              | Heuristically, such a contrast of cases, which at first sight do not seem to have a
              | lot in common, may help to illustrate the sometimes paradoxical dynamics of in-
              | tergenerational transmission.
              | Notes
              | 1 It seems obvious that in the two cases discussed here the experiences passed on by the
              | older generation were traumatic; in addition to that we assume that our interviewees
              | suffered traumatic experiences later on in their biography and might continue to do so.
              | However, the aim of this article is not to identify transgenerational traumatization or
              | to clinically distinguish between those experiences passed on by the older generation
              | and those that were actually experienced by the interviewees themselves. We assume
              | that trauma was passed on, but that predicting results of this transmission would
              | mean to ignore precisely the capacity of the younger generation to actively make sense
              | of it. Therefore, our focus lies on the younger generation’s reinterpretations and their
              | active role in dealing with what is passed on to them.

              | 3 To briefly contextualize the field of French child welfare: according to ONED’s estima-
              | tion, at the end of 2011, the number of minors supported by child welfare was approx-
              | imately 275 000 and the number of young adults between 18 and 21 years old was
              | about 21 000. Among all these children concerned by child protection measure, approx-
              | imately 133 000 children are outplaced in foster families of in institution.
              | 4 This question appears in the international European context. The UN Convention on
              | the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) contains articles that relate to religion or ethnic ori-
              | gins (Articles 2‒14‒30).
              | 5 This is a central difference between UNRWA’s and UNHCR’s definition of who is to be
              | considered a refugee. According to UNHCR’s definition, this status cannot be passed
              | on. UNHCR was founded in 1950, one year after UNRWA, and caters to all other refu-
              | gees worldwide. This difference and a more detailed comparison between UNRWA and

              | UNHCR reveal an important shift of the international community’s strategy to react to
              | refugee crises. According to Benjamin Schiff, “UNRWA is surviving, because the condi-
              | tions for its founding and perpetuation continue, but, as an international organization,
              | it is an evolutionary dead end. It provides assistance vital to the Palestinian refugees
              | and valuable lessons for other aid agencies, but the United Nations learned from its
              | UNRWA experience never again to create an organization dedicated indefinitely to the
              | care of a single refugee group.” (Schiff 1995, p. 270)
              | 6 That accounts not only for armed confrontations with Israeli forces in West Bank and
              | Gaza, but also for the “War of the Camps” (1985–1987) in the course of the Lebanese
              | civil war or, currently, the confrontations and the ensuing siege the Syrian army im-
              | posed on the Palestinian Refugee Camp Yarmouk in Damascus.
              | 7 The methodology of ethno-analysis/ethno-hermeneutics was developed by Hans Bosse
              | (1979) and combines the perspectives of ethno-psychoanalysis and group analysis. It
              | focuses on the research situation, especially the group dynamics and research relation-
              | ship developing therein (Bosse 1979, 1994, 1996, 2007; Schwarz 2010, 2014). However,
              | in order to not complicate the contrast of this case with the first one, the interpreta-
              | tions presented in this article are mainly based on an adapted narrative analysis in-
              | spired by Fritz Schütze (1977, 1983) and Gerhard Riemann (1985, 1986).
              | 8 All names of institutions and persons were replaced by pseudonyms, and all local ref-
              | erences altered by the authors in order to guarantee the anonymity of the interview-
              | ees.
              | 9 The notion of narratives in this case study is applied in a twofold sense: with reference
              | to empirical material, i.e. the interviews, we distinguish between narratives, descrip-
              | tions and argumentations of the interviewed subjects in the sense of Fritz Schütze
              | (1977, 1983) and Gerhard Riemann (1986, 1986). That means, an interviewee’s per-
              | sonal, biographical narrative – which can also be the collective narrative of a group of
              | interviewees who experienced certain events together – tells personal experiences of
              | the subjects. Usually they are told as one-time experiences, that is, they are referred to
              | as located in a particular time and place, relevant for one’s further biographical devel-
              | opment and having the quality of changing one’s own perception of the world. This
              | sometimes occurred in the group interviews but not in those passages that can best
              | serve to illustrate the processes of intergenerational transmission, which is why they
              | were not presented here. In contrast, when we speak for example of national narra-
              | tives or master narratives (Hammack 2011), we don’t speak about personal experience
              | per se, but how personal experience is framed within the collective narrative with
              | which one identifies. We touch upon collective memory on a higher level – that of an
              | imagined community (Anderson 1983) instead of the memory of a group that is based
              | on personal relations.
              | 10 This statement was not in reaction to an explicit question by the interviewer but oc-
              | curred in the course of his monologue.
              | 11 Phrases or words in Arabic have been translated to English but appear in italic letters
              | in order to demark the difference.
              | 12 Therefore, the dabka group can indeed be seen as a potential space of adolescence
              | (King 2002) that conditionally allows for individuation, in the sense of the reflexive de-
              | velopment of an individual life project through the experimentation with new roles and
              | the active quest for experiences in new environments.
