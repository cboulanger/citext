              | Intergenerational transmissions in
              | transnational families and national affiliations
              | Abstract:
              | This article explains and illustrates the method of family histories, reconstructed from
              | crossed biographical interviews of different members of the same family. This methodolo-
              | gy allows for the collection of fine and precious data in order to try to understand the
              | complexity of the dynamics of intergenerational transmissions and the construction of na-
              | tional affiliations of immigrants’ descendants. It shows how continuously shifting family
              | relationships underlie creativity in parenting strategies. In addition, this approach can
              | circumvent some specific barriers to the study of immigrant families, who often speak un-
              | easily with researchers. This methodology helps us to avoid reification of static identities.

              | 1 Introduction
              | Having followed several immigrant families in France and in other European
              | countries over long periods as ethnographic observers and biographical-narrative
              | interviewers, we specifically focused on how they try to find ways to fight the ef-
              | fects of stigmatization (or “discredit”). We discovered that most parents are con-
              | tinuously adapting their parenting styles and techniques to guide their children’s
              | development. Some of their children face a double bind: on the one hand, the host
              | society asks them to “integrate”, that means to enter labour markets and melt in-
              | to the host country ways of life. On the other hand teachers, employers, the police
              | and media keep considering them as “different”. This tension is particularly sig-
              | nificant in France, whereas it appears easier for immigrants to find their room in
              | Germany (Pape 2012). But in both countries immigrant parents show tremendous
              | creativity in trying to help their children, boys and girls differently, to cope with
              | this double bind1.
              | Immigrant parents who succeed in migrating from their country, an ex-colony,
              | to the “colonising” European country have to face not only xenophobia but also

              | post-colonial prejudices on both labour and housing markets and in the contexts of
              | both work and everyday life. Nevertheless the vast majority of migrants are carry-
              | ing within themselves a project for a better life: for themselves, for their kin at
              | home, and especially for their children, boys and girls; a project that orients,
              | drives, and organizes all their courses of action. But in bringing up and educating
              | their children, these parents become aware of the difficulty of the task.
              | Most of these families possess neither economic resources nor credentials but
              | all try to varying degrees to pass down to their children “personal resources”,
              | which we call subjective resources2. One of the ways they do that is by explaining
              | to their daughters and sons their family story, specifically why they have left their
              | country of origin and have come to the host country they live in. Indeed the key
              | element of this process of transmission from generation to generation is through
              | the telling of family histories. As Robert Neuburger suggests, “Passing down suc-
              | cessfully amounts to passing down the ability to pass down” (Neuburger 1997, p.
              | 15). Family history, as told by parents to children, is a tool, conveying not only in-
              | formation about the past and tradition, but also about the need for change. And
              | the power of these stories, as Toshiaki Kozakaï remarks, rests not on biological
              | parenthood, but on bonding through the sharing of childhood years (Kozakaï
              | 2000).
              | But this is a hard task. Some migrant parents seem to have difficulties in pass-
              | ing down their own life history to their children. This history will have been
              | shaped by a twofold series of humiliating experiences. First, and common to eve-
              | rybody, irrespective of whether they were born in France, Germany or have emi-
              | grated, is the experience of having occupied the lowest posts in society. Second,
              | and specific to immigrants, is the racism that they have experienced. Immigrant
              | parents have often difficult family histories in relation to colonisation, wars…
              | They are sometimes prone to silence when it comes to admitting what they have
              | been through. But this silence is also a collective phenomenon in which the media
              | play a large part. Indeed for example the media continue ignoring the history of
              | French working class (immigrant being a significant part of this class), while en-
              | hancing the history of the French peasantry as part of national identity.
              | In our French-German seminar we have worked on this difficulty of passing on
              | family history and we have linked this process of transmission to that of socialisa-
              | tion which is a conscious process carried out by agents who aim to inculcate into
              | children and teenagers the norms of the host society. Peers from the host society
              | play a crucial role in socialising migrant children. As Jean Piaget explains in his
              | book “Jugement moral chez l’enfant” (The moral judgment of the child) (1392/2000),
              | one cannot neglect the role of the child her or himself as an active participant in
              | this process of self-socialisation. He or she adapts him or herself to the environ-
              | ment, but impinges also on it (and first of all, on his or her parents).
              | Socialisation cannot be reduced to schooling; it is an implicit impregnation. The
              | moments within the family must contribute to giving meaning to the past and
              | present lived experiences of parents and children here (host country) and there
              | (country of origin). The success (or failure) of this process also depends on how
              | family memory and history are connected, and how parents are able to legitimate
              | in a dynamic way their own culture of origin avoiding contradictions and silences.
              | But parents have to find partners (teachers, friends, neighbours, community lea-
              | ders or family members) to avoid a “guerre des mémoires” (war of memories) (Blan-
              | chard/Veyrat-Masson 2008; Bhabha 1994/2007; Saïd 1979/1994). Colonisation and
              | post-colonialism are indeed difficult subjects to deal with and are often the occa-

text          | sion of such a “war” opposing different ways to understand and talk about past
              | events, regarding the group of belonging. Each group tends to defend its memory
              | and, considering the place or country they live in, some have more chances than
              | the other to be able to have their (his)tory recognized as a legitimate one.
              | The situation is different in France and Germany. In Germany, because of its
              | “defeat” in World War II, the “re-education” measures by the Allies, the public tri-
              | als such as those in Nuremberg or the Auschwitz trials in Frankfurt and ensuing
              | public debates, it appears that self-critical reflexivity about national history seems
              | to be more developed than in France. The sense of belonging of migrant children
              | and their national affiliation depends on the dialogue between migrant parents
              | and the host society. This dialogue, more or less easy to establish, depends itself
              | on the history of the different countries. The room given to migrants and their
              | own stories is also due to the political system and tradition in the host countries,
              | more or less centralized. And, more specifically, it comes from the different na-
              | tional histories regarding migration and the different ways the national policies
              | have been dealing with it. “While France has been marked by its integration mod-
              | el through assimilation, there still exists no clear integration policy in Germany
              | (Simon 2005, Thränhardt 2009)” (Pape 2012, p. 430). We focus here on the French
              | situation and its specificities that are enlightened thanks to a comparison with
              | the situation in Germany; this comparison is a further result of our work during
              | the seminar and of the discussion of the papers of our colleagues.
              | We will first present our methodology of reconstructing family histories by
              | means of “entretiens croisés” (crossed interviews) of parents and children. Then
              | we will present some case histories of transnational families, questioning the dy-
              | namics between intergenerational transmissions and national affiliations. For
              | each case, we met and interviewed the two parents and, at least, one of the chil-
              | dren (in most cases two). The interviews were biographical: they were following
              | both the life course of the interviewee and the way he or she made links between
              | the different events marking it. They lasted, in general, between one hour and a
              | half and three hours. Some were repeated across time, once or twice.
              | In the first two cases we provide examples of migrants’ descendants facing dif-
              | ficulties in the construction of their affiliation to a given nation, and we show how
              | they tend to choose one main affiliation excluding the others. In the last two case
              | studies we show how immigrant parents help their children to build various affili-
              | ations to several nations, by using specific strategies of bringing-up. The develop-
              | ment of one or the other model has to do with the family’s migration history and
              | the meaning they gave to it.
              | 2 The methodology of crossed biographical
              | interviews
              | Before presenting our comments on the subtle processes involved in intergenera-
              | tional transmission, it is important to discuss the methodology used to collect the
              | data. We used a process of “récits croisés” (Delcroix, 1995), comparing and con-
              | trasting data generated through (biographical interviews) with different members
              | of the same family. We also explain below how this method both provides a source
meta          | 28

              | of rich information and also circumvents some of the specific difficulties commonly
              | encountered in the study of migrant families.
              | 2.1 Using life stories within the same family
              | To study the evolution of feelings of national affiliation of immigrants and their
              | descendants, we have conducted a large number of biographical-narrative inter-
              | views in different fieldwork contexts. As Daniel Bertaux argues, the biographical
              | approach allows researchers to study “a particular fragment of social and histori-
              | cal reality from an ethno-sociological perspective [...] focusing on the patterns of
              | social relations [...] that characterize it” (Bertaux 1997, p. 7)3. Given that there are
              | a number of social and cultural dimensions in any specific context (Schütz 1987),
              | identifying the specific configuration of these dimensions requires a study of this
              | case, with an inductive approach, to capture the social logics that it testifies. The
              | stories collected deal with both practices, beliefs and representations, which are
              | presented in a diachronic structure that gives them meaning and allows us to
              | make connections between them. The objective is to encourage the narration of
              | events, the description of the relations linking them and the explanation of the
              | representations that social actors develop about those facts. The challenge is to
              | understand potential causal pathways and to understand the meaning they have
              | for individuals, reasoning in the framework of a comprehensive approach.
              | To investigate how feelings of national affiliation result from intergenerational
              | transmissions of family migration history in immigrant families in France, we
              | have developed this approach, following the method established by Catherine
              | Delcroix: the reconstruction of family histories, drawn from life story interviews
              | with several members of each family (Delcroix 2000; 2009; 2001/2013). The rele-
              | vance of this methodology lies in the importance of the family as a “micro-
              | environment of inter-subjective relations where [...] emotional, moral and “seman-
              | tic” relations dominate, that is to say, generate meaning” (Bertaux 1997, p. 38)4.
              | The family members are as “significant others”, in the words of George Herbert
              | Mead, particularly important.
              | In this article we have focused in particular on working-class families, originat-
              | ing from Maghreb or Sub-Saharan Africa, facing economic instability and discrimi-
              | nation. In order to reach a better understanding of the experiences of these families
              | and their members, it was essential for us to hear their own intimate accounts of
              | their lives. This is not easy to achieve and requires the building of a relationship of
              | trust able to counteract the effects of stigmatizing discourses that can hinder the
              | desire of these people to share their life story. It was then important to explain that
              | we were not there to examine and judge them but to grasp and describe the efforts
              | they were making to overcome their difficulties. Thus, we have reconstructed in-
              | depth case studies of immigrant families, using an approach combining ethno-
              | graphic and sociological methods. The ethnographic approach consists in spending
              | as much time as possible with the families, in their everyday life activities or on
              | outings and on holidays, to observe what they do and discuss what they think. The
              | sociological approach seeks to identify different types of life paths and diverse pro-
              | files of families and to analyse the collective processes they are experiencing.
              | The objective of this method is to locate each of social actors within the frame-
              | work of family time and historical time, investigating several generations. Meet-

text          | ing parents and children, talking with them about their lives helps us to recon-
              | struct the general history of the family and discover how each of its members has
              | experienced and understood this shared history. But with each of them, we can al-
              | so collect different information, which allows us to situate the family history in a
              | wider temporality. Parent’s stories offer an opportunity to make connections be-
              | tween past and present. Making them talk about their childhood can also be an oc-
              | casion to know more about the generation of grandparents. The stories of their
              | children provide links between the present and the future. We have access to their
              | projects and how they are becoming adults by re-appropriating their family history.
              | Before highlighting the richness of data collected through this methodology, we
              | will now describe why it is that this approach is particularly important to over-
              | come difficulties faced in carrying out fieldwork with migrant families.
              | 2.2 Specific difficulties in the study of immigrant families
              | As Ursula Apitzsch stated in our Franco-German seminar, ethnicity or rather
              | ethnic affiliations, are in tension between potentially stigmatizing ascribed identi-
              | ty and self-claimed identity. She spoke of the difficult dialectic between both eth-
              | nicity as a form of often-unwelcome attribution by others and ethnicity as a form
              | of a conscious self-definition of individuals within the social context of a communi-
              | ty. She added that, paradoxically, the second process produces the tendency of
              | transforming ethnic belonging into an inheritable social position. But how to
              | study this “transformation” while the claim of an ethnic identity seen as “other” in
              | European societies, is often devalued and causes “social sanctions” as for instance
              | difficulty to find a job?
              | Indeed, immigrant families in France and Germany face a major discredit be-
              | cause of their geographical origin and their cultural practices. They carry “discred-
              | iting differences” which have a double effect: their visibility in the public sphere is
              | subject to negative stereotypes or they are confined to invisibility. In both cases,
              | their existence is not recognised, or is only recognised with difficulty. This discredit
              | tends to make it more complex to know the actions of immigrants and their chil-
              | dren, their plans, and their discourses, as soon as they seem to move away from the
              | model to which they are expected to comply: a well “integrated” worker.
              | This phenomenon is particularly strong in France, because of its republican
              | model that de-legitimises foreign origin and all practices and claims for recognition
              | (Honneth 1992/2000). The discrediting discourse derives partly from the experience
              | of colonisation that initially shaped the representations of colonised people that still
              | weigh on their descendants. This is particularly true for Muslims. A good example
              | of this would be the experience of Algerians who were offered French nationality
              | only if they agreed to renounce Islam (Décret Crémieux 1870; Delcroix 2009).
              | This public and political discourse has a very tangible impact on the attitudes
              | and discourses of migrants and their descendants. As a reaction, they tend to
              | erase what is perceived in the host country as unacceptable differences in some
              | everyday practises. In the way they present themselves, some seem to deliberately
              | forget their foreign origin, or underestimate its importance. It was only after
              | spending time with them that they began talking openly with us about it. Others,
              | however, respond by “turning the stigma”, as Erving Goffman said, claiming their
              | identity in a positive way, as for example when Muslim women decide to wear the
meta          | 30
text          | ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 25‒38
              | veil, this practice being sometimes associated with an explicitly political discourse.
              | In all cases, they have to deal with multiple identities, some of which are more or
              | less stigmatizing (Lagier 2011).
              | In addition from the point of view of the host countries, the history of migrants
              | often begins from when they crossed the border to settle here. However, before
              | migrating, these individuals are first emigrants who left their country of origin, as
              | recalled by Abdelmalek Sayad (1999). But everything regarding their past is
              | largely undervalued and is not considered by the institutions of the host countries
              | as a worthy story to be told. Thus, unlike the French and German families in their
              | respective countries, migrant families are isolated to pass on their history and
              | memory (Bertaux/Delcroix 2009). They are not supported by the institutions of the
              | country of installation, especially the schools and the media, and are even dis-
              | couraged from doing so on behalf of the idea that integration requires forgetting
              | one’s origin. It is, again, difficult to have access to their history and how it is
              | passed on through generations.
              | But these difficulties should not be considered as curbing the study. Instead
              | they are to be treated as being fully part of the study. To better understand the
              | social logic that shapes migrant families’ lives, the method of reconstructing fami-
              | ly histories is particularly valuable. It gives indeed access to educational strate-
              | gies implemented by parents, to the dynamics of intergenerational transmissions,
              | to gender relations; and to the processes of collective and individual construction
              | of feelings of affiliation to one or several nations. This is what we want to show in
              | the following case studies.
              | 3 Case studies: a multi-affiliation difficult to manage
              | Let us now see some examples, case studies, illustrating the efficiency of the
              | method and its relevance to study national affiliations of the different members of
              | transnational families. The first two case studies present situations where the mi-
              | gration paths and the transmission – or non-transmission – of family history lead
              | to affiliations difficult to manage for the immigrants’ descendants. They then tend
              | to favour one specific (national) identification among all those they might recog-
              | nize themselves in, as shown in the first case. Or they face difficulties in building
              | their affiliation and identification, as shown in the second case.
              | 3.1 When “forced migration” and discredit lead to choosing a
              | unique affiliation: the Roinamze Family5 history
              | The Roinamze family, of Togolese origin by the father and Ghanaian origin by the
              | mother, has a special story. Parents came to live in France with their young chil-
              | dren in the late 1970s to escape Togo after a military coup put an end to the re-
              | public. The father, Leon, had kinship-ties with a former member of the president's
              | family who was murdered. When he learnt that he also was threatened, he decid-
              | ed to flee with his family to France – he had already stayed several times in this
              | country before – to ask for the status of political refugee.

text          | The two parents are very bonded to their country of origin and their African ori-
              | gins. The mother regularly goes and stays in Ghana – a country in which the fami-
              | ly has no difficulties to travel to – and she brings her children there on holidays.
              | When we met the family, she was in Ghana, where she was creating an orphanage;
              | she has spent most of her time there in recent years. The older daughter has re-
              | cently settled in Ghana; she works in a bank in Accra. The fact that the mother
              | and the daughter live in Ghana demonstrates the strength of the links maintained
              | with the country, even if the price is the distance between family members.
              | Leon, the father, is also very attached to his country, Togo, and he wishes to re-
              | turn there as soon as possible and regain a political position. Even if he lives far
              | away, he is very involved in the political life of this country. He is a member, in
              | France, of a Togolese opposition party. He said: “I have carnal relations with Togo
              | because I am very politically involved in Togo today, since I am a member of the
              | French section of the Union of Forces for Change in Togo”6.
              | But the family is also closely connected to France, and some members are in-
              | volved in local associative life in their neighbourhood. One of the girls is involved
              | in an association for school tutoring, and Leon is elected to the city council. But
              | the eyes of most members of the family are turned towards Africa, to Ghana and
              | Togo in particular.
              | The migration trajectory of the parents was not immediately told to the chil-
              | dren. Kofi, one of the five children in the family, a young 32 year-old man7, ex-
              | plained that it is primarily his grandmother, living in Ghana, who made him
              | aware of the history of his father and the danger he faced. Migration is presented
              | as constrained to the political context. But, more broadly, the way parents have
              | explained this trajectory and the way children have understood it as a “tearing”
              | (Kofi), may result from the fact their migration meant a significant social down-
              | grading for the family. The father and mother belong to the upper classes of their
              | respective countries of origin. Their families are large landowners. Leon had a
              | large transport company before being forced to emigrate. On arriving in France he
              | worked as boilermaker and then as caretaker.
              | This “forced” and painful migration trajectory, leading to significant social
              | downgrading, may explain the difficulty in developing a positive affiliation to the
              | French nation. Most members of the family we have met wish to return to Togo or
              | Ghana. But for the father, Leon, and for his son, Kofi – we both interviewed them
              | extensively – ambitions are not the same. Leon wants to go to Togo to participate
              | in the political life of his country. Kofi also wants to return but to carry on its
              | “pan-African political struggle” beyond the Togolese context. If the father defines
              | himself as Togolese, the son primarily defines himself as “Black”. The more radi-
              | cal political involvement of Kofi can be understood as a reaction to the discredit
              | and racism experienced in France. But for both, the migration history path, its
              | consequences and its understanding by each of them, could have encouraged the
              | fact that they define themselves by a single affiliation, national origin for the fa-
              | ther and “racial” identity for the son.
              | In the Roinamze family, between Leon and Kofi in particular, what has been
              | passed on is not only a relation to the country of origin or to the host country; it is
              | also a relation to political commitment. The importance of politics comes from its
              | place in the family history before migration, its essential role as a motivation to
              | migrate, and from the fact that the father is very involved. Thus, if Kofi explains
              | his involvement in radical pan-Africanism from the racism he has been victim of
              | as a Black in France, it can also be understood as a form of affiliation to the line-
meta          | 32
text          | ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 25‒38
              | age of his father. If the commitments of Leon and Kofi are quite different, they al-
              | so have much in common: both are “oriented” towards the country or region of
              | origin, and both generate intense activities and identifications. About this, Leon
              | said “I even think that’s what keeps me alive”. And we find the same idea when Ko-
              | fi told us “My political struggle is the struggle of my life”.
              | In the end, the intense political involvement certainly strengthens the tendency
              | to affiliate to one nation or one origin for the defence of which they feel they must
              | fight. But this impossible construction of a multi-affiliation is also due to the mi-
              | gration path and how the children understood it, and from the racism experienced
              | in France. More generally, this case illustrates how intergenerational transmis-
              | sions are made of continuity and discontinuity. Nothing is ever passed on un-
              | changed through generations, without modification, without specific appropriation
              | by descendants. The method of family history reconstruction through crossed bio-
              | graphical interviews allows us to capture these subtle processes by giving access
              | to spheres of meaning construction of various protagonists.
              | 3.2 A “closed family”: the impact of being an orphan in the
              | country of origin
              | The following second case is a typical example of a father categorically refusing to
              | discuss his own experiences with his children. Mr Mohammed is the father of four
              | children. He came from Algeria with his wife twenty years ago. He has just retired
              | from working for a small servicing company that forms part of the French rail-
              | ways (SNCF). For Mr Mohammed, the most important task is to protect his chil-
              | dren from the external world that he sees as threatening. His 16-year-old son de-
              | scribes their relation:
              | “My parents, my father, they don’t trust me to go… even now to Wilson Square (the city
              | centre). He has never been to the cinema with me, in fact, I have never been to the cine-
              | ma at all. During the holidays I do nothing with my parents, with my father… My par-
              | ents are worried about me.”
              | Mr. Mohammed did not want to be interviewed and his wife explained his refusal
              | in this way:
              | “My children don’t go to their friend’s house… The most important thing is to pay the rent
              | first. My husband has just been forced to retire and I don’t work. He leaves the house in
              | the morning to go for walks and comes back in the evening… He hasn’t had a close friend
              | since he was married. He is a solitary person, like myself.”
              | This inward-looking attitude came about as the result of several negative experi-
              | ences, as Mrs Mohammed went on to describe:
              | “When we first came to France, the social worker wanted to send us back to Algeria. She
              | said that the room we were living in was too small. But it was our choice to live in anoth-
              | er country, although in coming here in France we are not free. In France, the authorities
              | constantly check us. It is not easy for us… Wherever they go, my children are seen as for-
              | eigners. […] I sometimes feel that we have made a big mistake. You are Arabs, you are
              | foreigners, you are immigrants… You go into an office and they make you aware of it all
              | the time. Even my little girl of 6 understands. However, some things are better here than
              | over there: freedom, free speech, and trustworthy persons; but we are still strangers… It
              | is difficult for their father. He never says anything and he doesn’t know Algeria (he came
              | C. Delcroix, E. Lagier: Intergenerational transmissions in transnational families
meta          | 33
text          | to France at a very young age and never went back to Algeria). At the same time, he
              | doesn’t want to change his nationality and he could never live with other Algerians.”
              | Behind the silence of this father is a personal history. As he told it to us, he never
              | knew his own father. Moreover, as he is an orphan, he had no experience of a fa-
              | ther-child relationship. In addition to that, he cannot count on the help of anybody
              | in his country of origin to help him in any sense. Thus, he does not have an “onto-
              | logical security” (Giddens 1991). Opposite to common sense, it is essential for par-
              | ents to have relations based on community belonging to be able to open transna-
              | tional spaces to their children. Mr Mohammed could not pass on to his children
              | his life story, which according to his wife, was characterized by a great deal of
              | courage in the face of adversity. His children do not know to which country they
              | belong. Here we can see how the two processes of family transmission and nation-
              | al belonging are related.

text          | Case studies: the opening of a range of
              | possibilities
              | Unlike the previous cases, the following two case studies show the influence of the
              | passing on of family migration history on the life courses of children, their career
              | choices, their places of residence and how they feel they belong to several nations
              | at once. These cases illustrate how intergenerational transmissions open a range
              | of possibilities in the construction of life courses and the identification of children.
              | 4.1 Intergenerational transmissions and the children’s choice
              | of a country to work and to live in: the Tahar Family case
              | history
              | Among the numerous families of migrants from Maghreb that we studied is Mr
              | Tahar, a migrant from Morocco, who has a specific strategy. He has five daughters
              | and one son, who is the last child. He came to France with the project of getting
              | his baccalauréat (Abitur in German) and continuing on as a university student.
              | But for various reasons he could not do it, and he has been working for the last
              | twenty years as a truck-driver.
              | He has developed a particular style of parenting which we find quite imagina-
              | tive: taking his children, one at a time, with him in his truck when the trip he has
              | to do is only for a few hundred kilometres and back. This way he is able to develop
              | a personalised relationship with each one of his children. All of them consider
              | these trips with their father as privileged moments. “We talk a lot”, his elder
              | daughter told us.
              | “He has been taking me to various French cities, and he has explained to me their histo-
              | ry. He has been telling me about cities he has visited in Germany, Italy… It was so inter-
              | esting. I developed a taste for foreign languages, and now I am studying to become an in-
              | terpreter, with a focus on German; because, according to what my father says, Germany
              | is a country I would like to live in”.

              | Her younger sister told us how much she enjoyed the stories her father told her
              | about the times he was growing up in Rabat. This is where she wants to live.
              | She also took much interest in how her father was driving his truck: changing
              | gears, checking that the engine and other parts function well, and taking good
              | care of his truck…“I watch when he puts on the handbrake. I would love to drive
              | and get my licence”. Now, at 18 years-old, she knows exactly what she wants to
              | do: to start an international trucking company in Morocco. Still at high school,
              | she has chosen a commercial orientation. She has a passion for trucks and is
              | presently getting her driving license for trucks. Even if her dream does not ma-
              | terialise – it was already the case for her father – this young lady already knows
              | where she wants to go and is busy trying to get there. And it is the same for her
              | elder sister.
              | A very important point is that this creative strategy has been elaborated to-
              | gether with the mother. The example of this man gave us a first hint about the
              | relevance for children’s self-representation, self-esteem, self-confidence and gen-
              | eral psychic balance, of whether they knew or not the history of their parents –
              | which is, in fact, their own pre-history. It was clear from what the two daughters
              | explained that, because their father had told each of them, separately, in long in-
              | formal conversations, who he was, and why he had migrated to France, they knew
              | pretty well where they were and why they were born in France from Moroccan
              | parents. It gives them a sense of continuity, a set of spatial and temporal markers;
              | in short it helps them build their own identity.
              | This is only a specific example of a much more general attitude and practice
              | which we have observed in many families: passing on to children the inner subjec-
              | tive resources they need to overcome the handicap they have from their ethnic and
              | social background, so that, remaining in France or not, they will be able to fully ex-
              | ercise their status of citizen. Mr Tahar has opened the door to future options for his
              | daughters. The elder two sisters do not have to choose between different national
              | affiliations; they already live in a transnational space because their father has been
              | able to give them an idea of the world through his own experiences of migration
              | and work. He enables them to be open to but critical of various cultural and social
              | worlds.
              | 4.2 Multi-affiliation as an educational project: the Benarma
              | Family case history
              | Wahid Benarma, the father, came as a young man to France in the late 1960s; he
              | was unemployed in Algeria. He was hoping to return to school and find a better
              | job than those he had had up to that point. But fairly quickly, he was forced to
              | lower his ambitions. He said: “I did odd jobs, only odd jobs”. He became a material
              | handler and workman. He married in Algeria in the late 1970s and his wife Dja-
              | mila came to live with him in France. Unfortunately he was victim of an industri-
              | al accident and Djamila had to take menial jobs to meet the needs of the home
              | and allow their children to go to college.
              | Djamila and Wahid have two children: a daughter, Zineb, 20 years old and a
              | son, Karim, 25 years old. Their parents strongly encouraged both of them to suc-
              | ceed in school and get a tertiary education. Both have appropriated this discourse
              | on the importance of academic success, seen as a necessary prelude to the success-
              | C. Delcroix, E. Lagier: Intergenerational transmissions in transnational families
meta          | 35
text          | ful career their parents hope for them. Djamila and Wahid passed on this project
              | to their children by mobilising their past personal experiences. They explained
              | that they did not have the opportunity to study in Algeria, and encouraged them
              | to take advantage of the opportunity they have to be born in France and be able to
              | get a proper education. Wahid even said: “If I had been to school, I would have had
              | a job, I would not even have had to come to France”.
              | After a Master degree in International Business, Karim became manager in a
              | large international group in the oil sector. Zineb, meanwhile, goes to a school for
              | tourism after having spent a year at university studying English. Karim ex-
              | plained the origins of his ambition:
              | “My personal motivation is my parents … That’s what made me want to go ahead, seeing
              | them sacrifice, so to say, for me and my sister. I have no right to disappoint them [...]
              | whereas they gave me the chance to have a roof, good health, an education, something
              | that millions of people have not yet in some countries”
              | The sacrifice of his parents that he refers to is twofold: on the one hand their mi-
              | gration to come to France and on the other hand the difficult jobs they have held
              | in order to finance their children’s studies.
              | Indeed, Djamila’s choice to work while Wahid could no longer do so is directly
              | related to her children. She said: “I will continue to work for my children [until re-
              | tirement] [...] I have much helped Karim [for studying] and again until now, I help
              | Zineb. If I work now, it’s mostly for my children”. The involvement of these par-
              | ents is well understood by their children who contribute, by their own success, to
              | the success of the whole family project to improve living conditions. Zineb told us
              | about the trajectory of her family: “It’s true that we started a little at the bottom of
              | the ladder because my parents came from Algeria, immigrant parents, we started
              | from nothing and then gradually it rose through the ranks”.
              | But the Benarma family project is not merely about social success passed on
              | between generations. It is also about attachment to different national affiliations
              | considered as necessarily multiple. The choices of school and professional trajecto-
              | ries of the children show a real attraction for foreign countries, particularly those
              | overseas. This cosmopolitism is a consequence of a conscious educational strategy
              | of their parents: the Benarma parents tell their story to Zineb and Karim and give
              | them very positive descriptions of their country of origin, Algeria, where they go
              | on holiday, as well as of their home country, France, where they travel often to-
              | gether as a family. Wahid said for instance, that France is a country that has giv-
              | en him a “second education”, which made him know his rights as a human being.
              | Djamila said that the first day after her arrival in France, she already felt “at
              | home”. They also talk about the difficult colonial history between France and Al-
              | geria. Wahid said about independence: “We went through hell”. But the colonial
              | period is presented to children in a positive way about France, as if to preserve a
              | “good image” of this country. The father explains that France is not responsible
              | for colonialism but accuses Europeans in general and Spain in particular.
              | In return, the children feel that it is “a chance to be in France”, even if it is not
              | “la vie en rose” as Karim says. At the same time both are very closely linked to
              | their parents’ country of origin. Before getting a job offer in Dubai – where he has
              | lived ever since – Karim wanted to take part in his company’s creation of an affili-
              | ated branch in Algeria. Zineb, in turn, would like to develop tourism in Algeria.
              | Both present themselves as “citizens of the world”, with special bonds to France
              | and Algeria.

              | As their life courses go, the Benarma parents have had to make compromises
              | on their initial migration project and Wahid in particular on his professional pro-
              | ject. In this case study, children have inherited these compromises and have ap-
              | propriated them to follow the ambitions that accompanied the migration of their
              | parents. Additionally, they also inherit a form of “multi-affiliation”, with the par-
              | ents saying that they are proud to be Algerian and happy to live in France, their
              | children being French. They have gradually rebuilt their national affiliations and
              | passed on to their children this reconstruction in process. Their children appropri-
              | ate it in their choices of career and country of residence. Such dynamics highlight
              | that what is passed on between generations is not a set of stabilised choices, prac-
              | tices or values but representations, history, ways to act, etc. that are subject to
              | change. Using this idea, during the Franco-German seminar, we proposed using
              | the term “transmissions of compromises” (Elsa Lagier) between parents and chil-
              | dren. Passing on compromises and changes that parents experienced throughout
              | their life course enables children to build affiliations to several nations at once.
              | 5 Conclusion: Accessing educational strategies and
              | intergenerational transmissions
              | To conclude, the reconstruction of family histories gives very good access to the
              | point that the object of transmission, according to Pierre Legendre (1985/2004), is
              | to pass on. Beyond the obvious tautological point of this statement lies the fact
              | that it is the act of passing on something (anything) which is by itself the whole
              | point, more than the content of what is passed on (be it land property, political
              | commitment, or some particular attachment). In families with few or no resources,
              | where there is no objective “capital” to pass on, there are still the non-tangible as-
              | sets of moral values and love which, together with the family history, can give
              | meaning to the current situation. This methodology helps us to avoid reification of
              | static identities.
              | A method against the reification of representations and affiliations
              | In general, the biographical approach and the use of narrative as a method of in-
              | quiry encourage individuals to place their experiences in time, to refer to their
              | past, and help locate the “turning points” in their life courses. Furthermore,
              | through crossed interviews within a family, we have access to the planned action
              | over several generations. This avoids any temptation to reify representations and
              | affiliations since they are grasped in the long term and in their dynamics. Thus,
              | for instance, it is not a question of studying identity but of studying identifications
              | in their plurality and their evolutions. We thus obtain data on the development of
              | feelings of national affiliation of migrant parents and their children, according to
              | the initial migration project and its progressive reconstruction over life courses.
              | Studying the dynamics of intergenerational transmissions
              | Additionally, collecting life stories from parents and children allows an in-depth
              | examination of educational strategies and dynamics of intergenerational trans-

text          | missions. This is to reveal the parents’ educational practices and how they organ-
              | ise themselves to try to give their children resources, values and principles. Recip-
              | rocally, it is to capture, in the children’s discourses, what they retain from the ed-
              | ucation provided by parents and, more widely, from the family history as it is re-
              | lated.
              | Moreover, we have information on what is passed on or not, in the private
              | sphere, in a different way for each child, depending on his/her sex, age, sibling po-
              | sition, etc. We then seek to compare the educational projects of the parents with
              | what their children keep, how they build their own family memory, their values
              | and how they make choices from the “palette” of affiliations that is, more or less
              | consciously, offered to them.
              | Studying the individual and collective construction of feelings of
              | affiliation
              | Finally, the method that we use provides not only information about feelings of af-
              | filiation – with their fluctuations – but also permits us to know how the family
              | members interact with each other and to compare how these affiliations are ex-
              | plained or justified by the different family members. Thus, we can study both the
              | weight of external factors and the personal experiences that take part in shaping
              | these claimed affiliations and how they are individually constructed for each fami-
              | ly member, based on the family heritage and the life courses and experiences of
              | each person. In so doing, we are able to analyse the construction of national affili-
              | ations as these echo the individual life course and relate to each individual’s place
              | within the family, which should be considered a group that is central to the for-
              | mation of identity and sense of belonging.
              | Notes
              | 1 This paper is based on the results of several research projects conducted in France
              | mainly and other European countries. Between 2005 and 2008, Catherine Delcroix and
              | Elsa Lagier have worked together on researching participation of inhabitants to the
              | public policy of urban renewal in two French cities: Dreux and Vernouillet, They met
              | and interviewed 40 families living in deprived neighborhood, using the method of
              | crossed biographical interviews presented in this paper. They chose families with simi-
              | lar living situations, and similar problems in terms of migration, work, resources and
              | family life. Our aim was to identify the different types of life paths and diverse profiles
              | of these city families.
              | To compare with migrant families living in Germany they based their comparisons on
              | the PHD results of Elise Pape (a member of our French-German seminar) on “Inter-
              | generational transmission processes in families with Moroccan origins in France and
              | Germany: “The pride to be oneself”, 2012, Strasbourg, Francfort. She had reconstruct
              | the history of 9 families living in France and in Germany. She had interviewed 40
              | members of these families (half in France and half in Germany).
              | 2 By this Catherine Delcroix means first of all, moral strength, courage, resilience, pa-
              | tience, tenacity but also reflexivity, imagination, and communicative skills; a resource
              | which is developed out of an intense reflexive process on one’s own biographical expe-
              | riences (Delcroix 2000; 2009).
