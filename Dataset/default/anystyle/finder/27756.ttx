              | Abstract
              | Previous research has shown that exposure to violent media increased aggression-related
              | affect and thoughts, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior as well as decreased
              | prosocial tendencies. The present research examined the hypothesis that exposure to prosocial
              | media promotes prosocial outcomes. Three studies revealed that listening to songs with
              | prosocial (relative to neutral) lyrics increased the accessibility of prosocial thoughts, led to
              | more interpersonal empathy, and fostered helping behavior. These results provide first
              | evidence for the predictive validity of the General Learning Model (Buckley & Anderson,
              | 2006) for the effects of media with prosocial content on prosocial thought, feeling, and
              | behavior.

              | Effects of songs with prosocial lyrics on prosocial thoughts, affect, and behavior
              | Exposure to media is omnipresent in people’s daily life. For instance, listening to
              | music—the topic of the present paper—is of substantial importance to many people: In
              | Europe, according to Nielsen Interactive Entertainment, people spend an average of 10.55
              | hours per week listening to music. Similarly, the average American youth listens to music 1.5
              | to 2.5 hours per day, not including the time they are exposed to music via music videos
              | (Roberts, Foehr, & Rideout, 2003). Other research (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003) also revealed
              | that people consider music an important aspect of their lives, which is at least as important as
              | most other leisure activities. This has led to the suggestion that media exposure could be an
              | important determinant of pro- (Mares & Woodard, 2005) and antisocial behavior (Robinson,
              | Wilde, Navracruz, Haydel, & Varady, 2001). However, whereas negative effects of exposure
              | to media with violent content on aggressive behavior are well-documented, research on the
              | effects of media with prosocial content on prosocial tendencies has been relatively sparse.
              | Thus, in the present research, the hypothesis is examined that exposure to songs with
              | prosocial lyrics increases prosocial thoughts, affect, and behavior. So far, this has not been
              | tested.
              | Research on Media Violence
              | It is well-documented that exposure to violent media promotes aggressive thoughts,
              | feelings, and behavior, and decreases prosocial behavior (for an overview, see Bushman &
              | Huesmann, 2006). For instance, correlational evidence indicated that consumers of rap and
              | heavy metal music reported more hostile attitudes (Rubin, West, & Mitchell, 2001).
              | Experimental studies corroborated this finding: Listening to aggressive (relative to neutral)
              | song lyrics increased aggressive thoughts, hostile feelings (Anderson, Carnagey, & Eubanks,
              | 2003), and aggressive action (Fischer & Greitemeyer, 2006; Hansen & Hansen, 1990).

              | Past research has also addressed the impact of violent video games on aggressive
              | cognitions, affect, and behavior. For instance, playing a violent (relative to a neutral) video
              | game increases the hostile expectation bias (Bushman & Anderson, 2002), state hostility and
              | anxiety levels (Anderson & Ford, 1986), desensitization to violence (Bartholow, Bushman, &
              | Sestir, 2006; Carnagey, Anderson, & Bushman, 2007), punitive behavior (Bartholow &
              | Anderson, 2002), physical violence (Gentile et al., 2004), and criminal actions (Anderson &
              | Dill, 2000), and decreases donations to a charity (Chambers & Ascione, 1987) and
              | cooperative behavior (Sheese & Graziano, 2005). Recent longitudinal evidence (Anderson,
              | Gentile, & Buckley, 2007) further revealed that exposure to violent video games had not only
              | short-term effects, but also long-term consequences in that aggressive tendencies were
              | significantly predicted by video game violence exposure five months earlier (even after
              | controlling for Time 1 aggressive tendencies). In sum, the detrimental effects of exposure to
              | violent media on aggression-related variables are well-documented.
              | Research on the Effects of Television on Prosocial Behavior
              | There is some indirect evidence for the possibility that exposure to prosocial songs
              | increases prosocial tendencies: it has been shown that exposure to television with prosocial
              | content has some positive effects. In an early study (Sprafkin, Liebert, & Poulos, 1975),
              | children were exposed to a film about the dog Lassie. In the prosocial condition, Lassie saved
              | her puppies by barking for help. In the control condition, no prosocial behavior was exhibited.
              | Results revealed that children in the prosocial condition were more likely to help a puppy in
              | need of help than children in the control condition. Two meta-analyses (Hearold, 1986; Mares
              | & Woodard, 2005) corroborated this finding: Exposure to prosocial television content has
              | beneficial effects on prosocial behavior.
              | Theoretical Perspectives
              | The effects of violent media on aggression-related variables have been mainly
              | ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
              | prosocial songs 5
              | explained by the General Aggression Model (GAM) proposed by Anderson and colleagues
              | (e.g., Anderson & Bushman, 2002). This model integrates various theories, including social
              | learning theory and related social-cognitive research, affective aggression model, social
              | information-processing model, script theory, and excitation transfer model. According to the
              | GAM, exposure to violent media activates an individual’s internal states (cognition, affect,
              | and arousal), which in turn change the interpretation of a potential conflict situation that
              | results in aggressive behavior. The initial impulse to violent media is based on an automatic
              | appraisal of the situation. However, when sufficient resources (e.g., cognitive capacity,
              | motivation) are available a more thoughtful behavioral reaction could also occur. In addition,
              | the model does not only account for short term effects of violent media exposure on
              | aggression, but also for long term changes as a results of repeated encounters with violent
              | media (i.e., each media exposure episode constitutes a learning trial).
              | Recently, this model has been expanded into a General Learning Model (GLM) to
              | explain the effects of both violent and non-violent media on social behavior (Buckley &
              | Anderson, 2006). As with the GAM, the GLM assumes that media exposure affects internal
              | variables, consisting of cognition, affect, and arousal, which lead to behavior. However, rather
              | than focusing only on the negative consequences of exposure to antisocial media, the GLM
              | suggests that positive media can have positive effects. Thus, depending on the content of the
              | media, either negative or positive effects of media exposure on social behavior are to be
              | expected. That is, whereas antisocial media instigate aggression and aggression-related
              | variables, prosocial media should foster prosocial outcomes. However, whereas many studies
              | have documented the influence of violent media exposure on aggression and aggression-
              | related variables, the effects of media with prosocial content on prosocial outcomes has not
              | been examined. Thus, the predictive validity of the GLM for prosocial effects of media has
              | not been tested.

text          | The Present Research
              | For this reason, the present research examined positive effects of exposure to prosocial
              | songs. The first two studies measured prosocial thoughts and affects, which are possible
              | precursors, as outlined by GLM, of prosocial action. Specifically, the hypothesis was tested
              | that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) songs increased the accessibility of prosocial
              | thoughts (Experiment 1) and led to more interpersonal empathy (Experiment 2). Finally,
              | Experiment 3 addressed behavioral outcomes from listening to songs with prosocial content in
              | that actual helping behavior was assessed.
              | Pilot testing
              | In all experiments, participants listened to two songs. To increase the ecological
              | validity of the experimental manipulation, one song with English lyrics and one song with
              | German lyrics were used. Artists and genres were matched across experimental conditions.
              | Participants in the prosocial condition were exposed to: “Love generation” (Bob Sinclair) and
              | “Kommt zusammen” (2raumwohnung). Participants in the neutral condition were exposed to:
              | “Rock this party” (Bob Sinclair) and “Lachen und Weinen” (2raumwohnung).
              | These songs were pretested in two pilot studies. Participants were from the same
              | participant pool as in the three main experiments. In both pilot studies, participants listened to
              | either the two prosocial or the two neutral songs. In the first pretest, there were 40 participants
              | (28 women, 12 men). After listening of each song, they rated to what extent the song lyrics
              | were prosocial, how much they liked the song, and to what extent the song was arousing. All
              | items were assessed on scales from 0 = not at all to 7 = definitely. As intended, the content of
              | the prosocial songs was perceived as being more prosocial (English song: M = 4.85, SD =
              | 1.46; German song: M = 4.20, SD = 1.88) than the content of the neutral songs (English song:
              | M = 2.55, SD = 1.73; German song: M = 0.65, SD = 0.81), t(38) = 4.54, p < .001, d = 1.44;
              | t(38) = 7.75, p < .001, d = 2.45, respectively. In contrast, there were no significant differences

              | song: M = 2.75, SD = 1.89; t(38) = 1.77, p = .09, d = 0.56).
              | In the second pretest (39 women, 11 men), perceived arousal and mood were assessed.
              | The Perceived Arousal Scale (Anderson, Deuser, & DeNeve, 1995) contains 31 adjectives
              | describing feelings of arousal (e.g., aroused) or lack of arousal (e.g., drowsy). Lack of arousal
              | items were reverse scored. Positive and negative emotions were assessed by employing the
              | PANAS (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). Arousal properties of the prosocial (M = 2.88,
              | SD = 0.74) and neutral songs (M = 3.03, SD = 0.79) were relatively similar, t(48) = 0.71, p =
              | .48, d = 0.20. In addition, there were no significant effects for mood, neither on the positive
              | affect scale (prosocial: M = 2.36, SD = 0.75, neutral: M = 2.12, SD = 0.77), t(48) = 1.08, p =
              | .29, d = 0.32, nor on the negative affect scale (prosocial: M = 1.40, SD = 0.38, neutral: M =
              | 1.48, SD = 0.50), t(48) = 0.60, p = .55, d = 0.18. Thus, because the arousal and mood
              | properties of the songs used were relatively similar, effects of the songs on prosocial thoughts,
              | feelings, and behavior cannot be attributed to mood and arousal differences. (With was aimed
              | for: inasmuch as both prosocial and neutral songs can affect arousal, the arousal route is
              | scientifically less interesting than the cognitive and the affective route, respectively.)
              | Experiment 1
              | The aim of Experiment 1 was to test the effect of prosocial songs on prosocial
              | thoughts. It was expected that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) songs would increase
              | the accessibility of prosocial thoughts.

              | Participants and design. Participants were 34 students (19 women, 11 men, four
              | participants did not indicate their sex) of the Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) in
              | Munich, Germany, who were randomly assigned to one of the two song conditions (prosocial
              | vs. neutral). There were 18 participants in the prosocial condition and 16 participants in the
              | neutral condition.
              | Procedure and materials. Participants were welcomed by one female experimenter
              | and learned that the purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of songs on
              | thinking. To assess prosocial thought accessibility, a word completion task was used. Such a
              | task has been successfully employed in previous research into the effects of violent media on
              | aggressive thoughts (e.g., Anderson et al., 2003; Barlett, Harris, & Bruey, 2008).1 Participants
              | received a list of 18 word fragments. Their task was to fill in the missing letters to form a
              | word. For instance, “hi___” can become the prosocial word “hilfe” (“help”) or the neutral
              | word “hier” (“here”). Accessibility of prosocial thoughts was the proportion of word
              | completions that were prosocial (that is, number of prosocial thoughts divided by the total
              | number of word fragments completed).
              | Then, participants responded to two control questions to verify that the prosocial and
              | the neutral songs differed in content. For each song, participants rated to what extent the song
              | lyrics were about helping and cooperation, respectively. These ratings were highly correlated
              | and thus combined to a prosocial index (English song: = .75; German song: = .82).
              | Finally, participants answered demographic questions, were thanked, and fully debriefed.
              | Participants were tested in small groups of three to four people.
              | Results and Discussion
              | As intended, the content of the prosocial and the neutral songs clearly differed. The
              | content of the prosocial songs was perceived as being more prosocial (English song: M =
              | 4.94, SD = 1.47; German song: M = 4.50, SD = 1.29) than the content of the neutral songs

              | instigate behavioral reactions. Before data on the effects of exposure to prosocial songs on
              | helping behavior are presented, I first address a second main route on how media exposure
              | may affect behavior: empathy as an indicator of affect. This was done in Experiment 2.
              | Experiment 2
              | Experiment 2 tested an important contributor to prosocial behavior, namely, empathy
              | (Batson, 1991). It was expected that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) songs would
              | increase empathy toward others in need.
              | Method
              | Participants and design. Participants were 38 students (27 women, 11 men) of the
              | LMU. There were 18 participants in the prosocial condition and 20 participants in the neutral
              | condition.
              | Procedure and materials. As in Experiment 1, participants were welcomed by a
              | female experimenter. They learned that they would take part in a marketing survey. After
              | listening to each song, participants indicated their liking of the song. Participants then learned
              | that another study was being conducted in which participants were asked to read essays from
              | ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
              | prosocial songs 10
              | other participants. Because the participant who was supposed to read the essays did not show
              | up for the study, the participant was asked to read and respond to two essays (adapted from
              | DeWall & Baumeister, 2006). The first essay stated that the author broke up with his
              | girlfriend, although they had been together for quite a long time and had been very close.
              | Recently, however, things had changed and she told him that she did not want to be tied down
              | to just one person. The author stated that he was suffering severely. In the second essay, the
              | author noted that he broke his leg during an intramural game. He had played for this team for
              | three years, but now this season is over for him. In addition to this mental pain, his injury
              | physically hurts. Life on campus is very difficult because of his crutches. He is really down
              | and this is all he thinks about. Directly after each essay, participants indicated how
              | sympathetic, compassionate, and soft-hearted they felt toward the author of the essay (see
              | Maner & Gailliot, 2007). These items were highly correlated and thus pooled in an empathy
              | scale (romantic relationship: = .75; broken leg: = .72).
              | As in Experiment 1, participants rated to what extent the song lyrics were about
              | helping and cooperation, respectively. These ratings were moderately correlated and thus
              | combined to a prosocial index (English song: = .55; German song: = .68). Finally,
              | participants answered demographic questions, were thanked, and fully debriefed. All
              | participants were tested individually.
              | Results and Discussion
              | As in Experiment 1, the content of the prosocial songs was perceived as being more
              | prosocial (English song: M = 4.22, SD = 1.32; German song: M = 4.28, SD = 1.77) than the
              | content of the neutral songs (English song: M = 2.70, SD = 1.51; German song: M = 1.70, SD

              | latter factor revealed a significant main effect for type of song, F(1, 36) = 6.51, p < .05, ² =
              | .15. Participants who had listened to the prosocial songs (weighted M = 7.05) felt more
              | empathy than those who had listened to the neutral songs (weighted M = 5.78). The

              | To summarize, Experiment 2 revealed that exposure to songs with prosocial lyrics
              | fostered interpersonal empathy. In concert with Experiment 1, findings of Experiment 2
              | suggest that exposure to prosocial media activates two of the main routes (cognition and
              | affect) proposed by GLM on how media exposure influences behavior.
              | Experiment 3
              | After Experiments 1 and 2 have shown that exposure to songs with prosocial content
              | affects cognition and affect that, as outlined by GLM, may instigate behavioral reactions,
              | Experiment 3 examines whether listening to prosocial songs indeed affects prosocial action. It
              | was expected that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) songs would foster prosocial
              | behavior.
              | Method
              | Participants and design. Participants were 90 students (55 women, 35 men) of the
              | LMU. They received 2 (approximately $3.20) for their participation. There were 45
              | participants in the prosocial condition and 45 participants in the neutral condition.
              | Procedure and materials. At the onset, participants were welcomed by two female
              | experimenters and learned that they would participate in a marketing survey on music
              | preferences. Then, the second experimenter left the room, and the participants listened to the
              | ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
              | prosocial songs 12
              | songs. After listening to the songs, the first experimenter left the room, and the second
              | experimenter, who was unaware of the participant’s experimental condition, reentered the
              | room. She gave the participants the 2 , and explained that the university was collecting
              | donations for a non-profit organization. Participants were told that it would be great if they
              | would donate these 2 but that it would be also fine if they did not donate. Upon saying this,
              | the experimenter pointed at a box on which the non-profit organization’s information was
              | printed. The experimenter left the room for 2 min and then returned. Finally, participants were
              | probed for suspicion, debriefed, and thanked. None of the participants indicated any
              | relatedness among listening to the songs and the donation to the non-profit organization. The
              | money was indeed donated to the non-profit organization.
              | Note that—because measurement of the possible mediators may prime the concept for
              | all participants and thus change subsequent measures of pro- and antisocial action—prosocial
              | behavior was assessed, but no possible mediators (see Spencer, Zanna, & Fong, 2005). In fact,
              | previous research into the effects of violent video games (e.g., Lindsay & Anderson, 2000)
              | has shown that measuring aggressive cognitions changes subsequent measures of aggressive
              | behavior.
              | Results and Discussion
              | As predicted, participants who had listened to the prosocial songs were more likely to
              | donate money than participants who had listened to the neutral songs, ²(1, N = 90) = 4.56, p
              | < .05, w = .27. Of the 45 participants who had listened to the prosocial songs, 24 donated. Of
              | the 45 participants who had listened to the neutral songs, 14 donated. That is, 53% of the
              | prosocial song condition helped, whereas 31% in the neutral song game condition did so.
              | Participant sex had no significant effect on donating, ²(1, N = 90) = 0.12, p = .73.
              | In summary, listening to songs with prosocial lyrics increased helping behavior. Thus,
              | after Experiments 1 and 2 have shown that prosocial songs influence cognition and affect,
              | ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
              | prosocial songs 13
              | which—according to GLM—are two of the main routes on how media exposure leads to
              | behavior, Experiment 3 in fact revealed that exposure to prosocial media promoted prosocial
              | reactions. However, because prosocial behavior and the possible mediators were assessed in
              | different studies, it remains unclear whether accessibility of prosocial thoughts and/or
              | interpersonal empathy indeed constitute the mediating path from media exposure to action. In
              | the present research, I wanted to provide first evidence for the effects of listening to prosocial
              | songs on prosocial cognitions, affects, and behaviors. Clarifying the exact causal mechanisms
              | awaits future research.
              | General Discussion
              | The aim of the present research was to examine the hypothesis that exposure to
              | prosocial media fosters prosocial tendencies. In fact, listening to prosocial (relative to neutral)
              | songs increased the accessibility of prosocial thoughts, led to more empathy, and instigated
              | prosocial action. Whereas previous research has demonstrated that violent media increased
              | aggression-related thoughts, feeling, and behavior (Bushman & Huesmann, 2006), the present
              | research shows that media with prosocial content result in prosocial tendencies. Thus, media
              | exposure affects social behavior and related variables not only negatively, but may also do so
              | positively (see Greitemeyer & Osswald, 2007, for the effects of prosocial video games on
              | prosocial behavior). Note also that across studies the effect for song exposure on thoughts,
              | feeling, and behavior was medium to large.
              | Theoretical Implications, Limitations, and Future Research
              | As noted above, using the GAM as a framework, there has been abundant research
              | demonstrating detrimental consequences of exposure to violent media on aggression-related
              | variables. To also account for positive effects of media exposure, this model has been
              | expanded into the GLM (Buckley & Anderson, 2006), but, as yet, the predictive validity of
              | the GLM for the effects of exposure to prosocial media on prosocial tendencies has not been
              | ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
              | prosocial songs 14
              | tested. Thus, the present studies constitute the first empirical evidence that the effects of
              | media exposure on social tendencies indeed depend to a great extent on the content of the
              | media being consumed.
              | As proposed by GLM, the present set of studies showed that listening to songs with
              | prosocial lyrics affected behavioral reactions as well as an individual’s internal states
              | (cognition and affect) that are assumed to elicit behavior. However, as noted above, the
              | present research did not address whether exposure to prosocial media indeed led to behavioral
              | reactions through these internal states. Thus, future research assessing internal states as well
              | as behavioral reactions in one study would be informative in this regard. Nevertheless, based
              | on the present results, it appears that the aim of GLM to bring the effects of media exposure
              | on pro- and antisocial tendencies together within a common theoretical framework is not only
              | a valuable endeavor, but is also supported by empirical evidence.
              | Previous research has demonstrated that violent media increased aggression and
              | decreased prosocial behavior (Anderson & Bushman, 2001). Here, evidence was presented
              | that listening to prosocial songs increased prosocial behavior. Thus, future research may
              | examine whether exposure to prosocial songs does not only increase prosocial tendencies, but
              | also decreases aggression and aggression-related variables.
              | The reader should be well aware that the present results are limited to the short-term:
              | the effects of listening to prosocial songs on immediate thoughts, affects, and behaviors were
              | examined. However, repeated exposure to media may affect long-term behavior (Huesmann
              | & Miller, 1994). According to GLM, repeated encounters with prosocial media may yield
              | long term changes in personality through the development and construction of knowledge
              | structures. In addition, the present results materialized even though participants listened to
              | only two songs. In real life, when people may repeatedly listen to prosocial songs, the positive
              | effects on prosocial behavior might be even more pronounced. Thus, the media does not only
              | ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
              | prosocial songs 15
              | increase the likelihood of aggressive and violent behavior, but could be also effectively used
              | to improve social interactions.
