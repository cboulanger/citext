              | During the Eurozone Crisis

              | Abstract: »Immer noch begeistert: Die unveränderte Europäizität der spani-
              | schen parlamentarischen Elite während der Eurozonen-Krise«. Since the adhe-
              | sion of Spain to the EEC in 1986, the Spanish electorate has shown a high level
              | of support for the European integration process. Even more enthusiastic than
              | their fellow citizens, Spanish political elites also expressed a strong commit-
              | ment to the European integration project, based in a pro-EU consensus beyond
              | party and ideological divides. However, Spain has also been one of the coun-
              | tries most affected by the economic and financial crisis that has hit the EU (par-
              | ticularly the Eurozone) since 2010. The main questions we aim to answer in this
              | paper is whether this crisis and its management by EU institutions has eroded the
              | traditional support for the EU shown by Spanish domestic political elites and, if
              | so, to what extent. To this end, we draw on survey data provided by the InTune
              | and ENEC-2014 projects on the attitudes of Spanish MPs towards the EU in the
              | years 2007, 2009, and 2014. Results show that the traditional pro-EU stance of
              | Spanish MPs has remained mostly stable during the crisis, yet such stability has
              | increased the representation gap with citizens in this area.

              | Introduction1
              | The financial crisis started in 2008 has produced enormous consequences in the
              | political life of the Southern European democracies. Scholars have detected ero-
              | sion of citizens’ support to political institutions and the main political actors,
              | particularly, mainstream political parties (Mair 2013; Cordero and Simón 2015;
              | Teixeira et al. 2016). As a consequence, an ‘electoral epidemic’ has profoundly
              | altered party systems, damaging the social basis of traditional political parties and
              | pushing new challenger actors to parliaments and governments at different levels
              | (Bosco and Verney 2012; Hernández and Kriesi 2016). Spain has been one out-
              | standing example of this transformation, which has brought new parties like
              | Podemos or Ciudadanos to the political landscape (Rodríguez-Teruel and Barrio,
              | 2015; Rodriguez-Teruel et al. 2016). These changes have affected not only na-
              | tional institutions but also the traditional support to the European Union (EU),
              | which in turn has fostered the raise of populist forces that question the role of
              | states in the European integration. Hence, an increase of critical attitudes of the
              | national political elites towards the EU in these countries could be spreading
              | among voters, and damaging indeed the traditional elite consensus on Europe.
              | This article aims to analyse the consequences of this political turbulence on
              | the Europeanness of the Spanish parliamentary elite. Spain has been traditionally
              | one of the more pro-European countries even before its accession to the European
              | Economic Community (EEC) in 1986 (Sanchez-Cuenca 2001; Szmolka 2007).
              | This consistency of political attitudes towards Europe has been particularly strong
              | among domestic elites, beyond party and ideological divides (Jerez et al. 2010;
              | Jerez et al. 2015a). However, Spain has also been one of the countries that has
              | most dramatically experienced the consequences of both the economic and finan-
              | cial debt crisis since 2008. This has been accompanied by a deterioration of the
              | support to the EU amongst the population. Previous works have suggested that
              | this did not occur with the national political elite in the beginning of the crisis
              | period (Sojka et al. 2015; Freire and Moury 2015). This article’s main question is
              | whether things have changed with the subsequent deepening of the economic
              | crisis. To check the evolution of the attitudes of Spanish political elites towards
              | the EU, we will examine survey data collected at three different time points:
              | 2007, 2009 and 2014.
              | Our main expectation is that continuity might prevail over change during the
              | observed period, in line with the continuity that has also characterised composi-
              | tion of the parliamentary elite (Jerez et al. 2016). Indeed, given the traditional

              | fieldwork of the ENEC project.

              | pro-EU consensus shared by the main political parties (the Popular Party, PP, and
              | the Socialist Party, PSOE), the absence of relevant party system changes in the
              | period we cover would contribute to keep the elite attitudes towards the EU under
              | stable patterns. Despite the impact of the Eurozone crisis, until 2015 the main
              | features of the Spanish party system were very stable. Although the 2011 general
              | election produced a serious collapse of the PSOE vote (which led this party to
              | lose the government to the PP), the concentration of the electoral vote and the
              | parliamentary representation amongst mainstream parties did not change signifi-
              | cantly, and those parties with soft Eurosceptic attitudes (Ruiz-Jiménez and Egea
              | de Haro 2011) remained a small minority in the national chamber. Consequently,
              | we expect to find a stable pattern in the main Europeanness traits of the Spanish
              | parliamentary elite, while potential changes in attitudes and opinions could obey
              | to party variance rather to elite transformation. In this respect, the article assesses
              | to what extent this elite consensus concerning the EU is affected by inter-party
              | divisions existing due to the politicization of EU issues at the national level.
              | Besides, since these mainstream positions regarding the EU within the elite con-
              | trast with the change in citizens’ attitudes, a resulting scenario would be an in-
              | crease in the gap between elite’s opinions and those of the general population,
              | eroding the traditional elite-mass congruence in Spain regarding the EU.
              | The rest of this article is structured as follows. The second section reviews the
              | main political facts that have shaped the political life in Spain in the last decade,
              | paying particular attention to the main issues related to the EU. Then, the third
              | section introduces the main concepts, expectations and the data employed in this
              | research. Section four analyses the political attitudes regarding the EU in the
              | parliamentary elite. And finally, the concluding section summarize the main
              | findings and connects patterns observed in the previous section with the changes
              | in the Spanish political system occurred since 2014.

              | A Turbulent Political Time in Spain
              | Although the time span strictly covered by the data used in this paper (2007-
              | 2014) may look too short to expect relevant changes, the Spanish political and
              | economic landscape experienced deep transformations. During this period,
              | there were three different parliamentary terms with episodes of government
              | change, economic instability and social turbulence. Along this time, the refer-
              | ences to the EU in the Spanish political debate have evolved from the optimism
              | during the referendum for the Constitutional treaty in 2005 to the controversy
              | in 2012-13 about the policy conditions linked to the bailout of the Spanish
              | financial system through the European Stability Mechanism.
              | The first government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero (2004-2008) was
              | characterised by a period of strong economic development, in which Spain
              | returned to its traditional support to Germany and France as leading actors in
              | HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 216
              | the EU, abandoning the transatlantic-oriented policy implemented by the previ-
              | ous prime minister, José Maria Aznar (Delgado et al. 2015). In this respect,
              | Zapatero gave strong relevance to the Spanish role in the process of ratification
              | of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. While in other countries
              | the Constitutional Treaty raised eurocriticism and division within the elite, in
              | Spain the vote was employed as a legitimacy device for the national govern-
              | ment. Indeed, Spain was one of the few countries in consulting citizens through
              | a referendum before the parliament ratified the document. Despite the clear
              | victory of those supporting the project2, a low level of public debate about the
              | text (with a resulting low turnout), and an image of consensus and complacen-
meta          | 3
text          | cy amongst political elites weakened the political outcome of the referendum .
              | The good results in terms of economic growth and unemployment lead the
              | Spanish GDP per capita to surpass Italy by the end of 2007, and fostered good
              | prospects to reduce distance between Spain and the main economies of the EU,
              | Germany and France. In this context, the positions of soft Eurocriticism in the
              | Spanish political elite were mainly related to two concerns (Ruiz-Jiménez and
              | Egea de Haro 2011, 117). On the one hand, there was the criticism from small
              | radical left parties regarding the lack of attention, from their point of view, to
              | social matters in the EU. On the other hand, nationalist parties in Catalonia and
              | the Basque country remained sceptical about the weak role of regional repre-
              | sentation in the EU institutional framework. By 2007, the Spanish citizens
              | showed the lowest levels of support to the idea that the Spain had not benefitted
              | from belonging to the EU since the access to the CEE in 1986 (Ruiz-Jiménez
              | and Egea de Haro 2011, 122).
              | The context changed dramatically during Zapatero’s second term (2008-
              | 2011). The burst of the US real-state bubble in autumn 2008, following the
              | collapse of Lehman Brothers, had a tremendous effect on the internal situation
              | of Spain and its own housing bubble. However, contrary to other European
              | countries, the Spanish government adopted a moderate approach against the
              | crisis, with discretionary counter-cyclical fiscal policies and a Keynesian strat-
              | egy (increasing the budget deficit to 11.1% of GDP at the end of 2009), while it
              | was reluctant to implement serious structural reforms. This helped to maintain
              | the public’s confidence in a quick exit from the crisis. But the deterioration of
              | the situation in Greece eventually forced the EU to intervene in order to hinder
              | the spread of the risk of default to other Southern European countries. Hence,
              | in May 2010 Zapatero announced a U-turn change in its policy agenda, with
              | 2 The referendum was held on the 20th of February 2015, with a turnout of 42,32%. The
              | constitutional project was backed by 76,7% of the participants. Some weeks later the Con-
              | greso de los Diputados (the lower house of the parliament) approved the text by 311 votes
              | against 10 (0 abstention) as well as the majority of the high chamber did (225 to six votes,
              | and one abstention).

              | emergency cuts and structural reforms aimed at containing the public deficit
              | and avoiding the risk of bailout. In August 2011, PSOE and PP approved an
              | amendment to the Spanish Constitution (article 135) introducing a cap on the
              | structural deficit of the state.
              | While support for the PSOE’s in the opinion polls shrank following this U-
              | turn in the government’s policies, the new agenda altered the role of the EU in
              | the Spanish public debate. The EU institutions started to be identified as the
              | promoters of the austerity policy implemented by the government, being also
              | blamed as responsible for the consequences that arouse in the following
              | months. Hence, some relevant intellectuals argued in favour of leaving the
              | euro4, while support for democracy and to the main political institutions de-
              | clined in parallel to what was happening in Southern European countries
              | (Alonso 2013). Political dissatisfaction also fostered social mobilization against
              | the government and the political class, like the massive demonstrations across
              | Spain held in May 15th 2011, dubbed the 15-M movement, also known as the
              | indignados (Fominaya 2015).
              | The collapse of the support for the government in the 2011 general election
              | gave the victory to the PP and paved the way for a majority government headed
              | by Mariano Rajoy. Despite the PSOE’s electoral setback, the two main parties
              | achieved 73% of the total vote. The new executive did not alter the agenda of
              | structural reforms, facing also major pressures from the EU to call for a bailout,
              | after the downgrade of several Spanish banks’ credit ratings. Indeed, the hous-
              | ing bubble crisis was evolved to a financial crisis in the banking system, partic-
              | ularly in the local and regional semipublic saving banks (cajas de ahorro).
              | Finally, the PP government accepted a bailout deal from the EU to the banking
              | system under the form of a loan to recapitalize Spain’s weakest banks (De
              | Guindos, 2016). In exchange, the government implemented new reforms and
              | accepted European monitoring of Spanish banking reform. However, the state
              | of the economy still experienced strong pressures during Rajoy’s first terms.
              | Thus, public debt evolved from 69,5% (2011) to 99,3% of the GDP (2014),
              | public deficit increased to -10,4% (2012), although budget cuts helped to re-
              | duce it to -5.9% (2014). In turn, unemployment peaked in 2013 to almost five
              | million people, while the youth unemployment rate reached 56% by that time,
              | although since 2014 it started to decrease slightly5.
              | The poor economic performance during the first years of the Rajoy govern-
              | ment, and the deepening of the social consequences of the austerity policies
              | fuelled political disaffection and electoral volatility (Cordero and Montero
              | 4 In this respect, Castells (2011) argued that the exit from the Eurozone was the only way for
              | the recovery of the Spanish economy. Similarly, Fernández-Albertos and Sánchez-Cuenca
              | (2013) defended that Spain should leave the euro if the EU could not strengthen the politi-
              | cal integration.

              | 2015, 350; Urquizu 2015). In 2012 and 2013 several surveys detected a dra-
              | matic collapse of the support for the two main Spanish parties, while the exist-
              | ing small parties did not really benefited from this (Rodríguez-Teruel 2013),
              | suggesting a failure of the political supply in Spain (Fernández-Albertos 2015).
              | In this context, the European election in May 2014 triggered an unprecedented
              | electoral dealignment, with the appearance of new parties like Podemos and
              | Ciudadanos on the EP, while the two main parties did not achieved even a 50%
              | of the total vote. The electoral change came mainly from young, urban, politi-
              | cally-informed voters (Cordero and Montero 2015; Fernández-Albertos 2015).
              | Amongst these voters, European attachment was significantly stronger com-
              | pared to the older electorate, although they seemed to express less interest in
              | the European election (Rodríguez-Teruel 2014). Interestingly, Spain remained
              | the largest country in the EU without Eurosceptic and far-right parties.

              | Theoretical Expectations and Data
              | Expectations: Stability Rather than Change
              | The financial crisis and its political consequences altered the position of Spain
              | in the EU, as we have argued in the previous section. It changed from a story of
              | economic success to a potential bailout, even though it would be ‘too big to
              | fail’. This turn could not happen without affecting citizens’ perceptions of the
              | political system and its legitimacy, although this negative effect should not
              | necessarily be immediate (Freire and Moury 2015, 179). Some figures show
              | that trust in government and its ability to manage the crisis steadily declined as
              | the crisis hit the Spanish economy, in a more consistent way than in other Eu-
              | ropean countries (Roth 2009, 22). According to previous studies, the way citi-
              | zens perceive their national governments and institutions influences strongly
              | their views and support for the EU (Anderson and Reichert 1995; Sánchez-
              | Cuenca 2000). From a utilitarian perspective, this support is also explained by
              | citizens’ perceptions of welfare gains from integration policies (Gabel 1998;
              | Scharpf 1999). Hence, a regression in policy outcomes and the subsequent
              | deterioration of the perception of national institutions might erode the support
              | for the EU amongst citizens.
              | However, these symptoms might not be necessarily appear among the politi-
              | cal elite. Parliamentarians’ attitudes and perceptions are elaborated and sustained
              | upon stronger cognitive support, since they are better informed about European
              | issues and have a strongest attachment to the EU (Müller et al. 2012; Sojka et al.
              | 2015; Freire and Moury 2015). Indeed, as political representatives know better
              | the limits in the EU’s room for manoeuvre, their expectations about the EU role
              | are more in line with reality. In countries like Spain, where the potential for uni-
              | lateral action is weaker, it might be even the case that such context of crisis could
              | HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 219
              | foster support for more integration, as the political elites might perceive that
              | overcoming the current situation or avoiding new crisis in the future requires a
              | supranational solution. Alternatively, an opposite evolution is also possible, since
              | politicians could adopt more critic positions towards the EU in response to an
              | increase of Euroscepticism among voters (Hooghe and Marks 2009).
              | The main theoretical expectation in this article is that the attitudes of Span-
              | ish MPs towards the EU have not significantly changed during the crisis. This
              | hypothesis is in line with the above mentioned arguments about elites’ higher
              | cognitive competence and the political stability in parliament during the ob-
              | served period. Therefore, between 2004 and 2014, despite of the electoral
              | changes mentioned in the previous section, the two main parties, both tradi-
              | tionally pro-EU, accounted for more than 80% of the seats at the lower house.6
              | Yet this does not mean the disappearance of ideological and party differences.
              | In fact, some studies (Ruiz Jiménez and Egea de Haro 2011; Vázquez et al.
              | 2014) have found differences in the pro-EU positions of PSOE and PP. For
              | instance, the PSOE has traditionally shown a more federalist stance, while the
              | PP has supported a view centred on the coincidence between EU and national
              | interests. Hence, a second theoretical expectation is stable interparty divisions
              | along ideological divides in both main parties, even though we do not expect
              | that these party differences respond to a high politicization of EU issues at the
              | national level. Consequently, they should not alter the general pattern of strong
              | Europeanness amongst Spanish elites.
              | 3.2
              | Dimensions of Europeanness
              | Our analysis focuses on the patterns of ‘Europeanness’ is defined here as a
              | “composite set of perceptions and sentiments” that drives political elites deci-
              | sions and behaviours in the European integration (Best, Lengyel and Verzichel-
              | li 2012, 8). In this sense, the concept departs from more generic uses in cultural
              | and identity studies, and captures several aspects of attitudes and preferences
              | towards European integration. Following those authors, Europeanness becomes
              | a multidimensional concept including the emotive, cognitive-evaluative, and
              | projective-conative dimensions (ibid. 8). The emotive dimension refers to
              | feelings of attachment and thus towards the European integration. The cogni-
              | tive-evaluative dimension includes attitudes dealing with the working of the
              | EU and its scope of governance. Finally, the projective-conative dimension is
              | based on the prospects and preferences for higher levels of European unifica-
              | tion and integration in the future.
              | Hence, the empirical data will be developed in the three sets of indicators
              | corresponding to the dimensions previously mentioned. First, attitudes of sup-

              | (2008) and 84% (2011).

              | port for the EU, related to the emotive dimension (trust in EU institutions,
              | attachment to the EU, and general support to the integration process). Second,
              | opinions and preferences on working of EU institutions and their scope of
              | governance (related to the cognitive dimension), including issues about how
              | the EU faced the financial crisis. Finally, options regarding the future of the
              | EU, including expectations and threats (conative dimension).

text          | The empirical basis for our analysis comes from the data gathered by the two
              | waves of the elite survey of the IntUne project (2007 and 2009) and the recent
              | ENEC survey (2014) conducted amongst national parliamentarians from sever-
              | al European countries. This allows us to develop a comparative analysis across
              | three parliamentary terms in Spain, covering the different periods described in
              | the historical section. The content of the IntUne 2007 and 2009 elite surveys in
              | Spain was presented and analysed in previous works (Jerez, Real-Dato and
              | Vázquez 2010, 2015a). Regarding the 2014 ENEC survey, it basically repeated
              | the structure and questions of the IntUne elite surveys, with some additional
              | questions aimed at grasping the mood of national political representatives dur-
              | ing the crisis. The sample consisted of 81 MPs, following the research design
              | of the project (see Table 1). The fieldwork was implemented between October
              | 21st 2014 and February 18th 2015 – though almost all but three interviews
              | were conducted before the end of 2014. Most of the interviews were face-to-
              | face (76.5%), while the rest were conducted by telephone. In this article, the
              | sample is weighted by three criteria: parliamentary group, gender and past

              | sample is 1.4% for party, 4.2% for sex (with a slight underrepresentation of
              | female MPs), and 0.5% for experience.
              | Data collection took place two years after the formation of the PP govern-

              | dataset differs from the two previous IntUne wages, conducted under PSOE
              | governments. The party composition is indeed the main difference between
              | both datasets. Our analysis controls for this factor when it comes to interpret
              | significant differences across time, by distinguishing between PSOE and PP
              | parliamentarians, or between left and right parties.

              | Findings: The Stability of Spanish Parliamentary Elite’s
              | Europeanness
              | The empirical results are presented following the three sets of indicators em-
              | ployed to depict the patterns of Europeanness that we observed in the Spanish
              | elite. Our analysis focus on the extent of change or stability detected in 2014
              | compared to the previous survey waves. In those cases of where significant
              | differences are found, we check whether party differences are responsible for
              | these changes.
              | 4.1
              | The Emotive Dimension: Attitudes of Support to the EU
              | Most aspects dealing with the emotive dimension of Spanish parliamentarians’
              | Europeanness does not show major changes during the period 2007-2014 (Fig-
              | ure 1). This general stability confirms the high level of support for European
              | integration among Spanish MPs. Only the level of trust in the European Par-
              | liament (EP) has experienced a statistically significant increase from 6.3 in
              | 2007 to 7.0 in 2014, while in the case of the European Commission (EC) and
              | the Council of the EU levels of trust remain approximately the same along the
              | observed period. No changes are also observed in the differences between
              | parties except in 2014, where a significant difference appear in the levels of
              | trust among socialist MPs and those of the PP (6.1 against 7.4 points).
              | The general positive stance is also observable in the indicator of attachment
              | to the EU. Despite having significantly stronger attachment to the nation and to
              | the region (Sojka et al. 2015), Spanish representatives are amongst those with
              | highest levels of attachment to the EU (nine out of ten MPs consider them-
              | selves somewhat or very attached). There has been a steady (but not signifi-
              | cant) increase of four points between 2007 and 2014, mainly because of the
              | evolution of those declaring being ‘very attached’ (ten points of differences),
              | including the 53.1% of the whole group. Therefore, the hard times experienced
              | by the Southern European countries and the controversy with the EU austerity

              | larger amongst the PSOE parliamentarians (61.5% are very attached) compared
              | to the PP (45%).
              | In turn, the perception that the country has benefit from EU membership has
              | remained mainly unaltered along time (Figure 1), being the percentage higher
              | than that for the level of attachment to the EU. This is congruent with the pub-
              | lic opinion view, and confirms Spain as a country in which Europeanness
              | seems clearly rooted on the positive assessment of EU membership. These data
              | support the utilitarian explanation of attitudes towards the EU, explained main-
              | ly by the positive outcomes member states and their populations have experi-
              | enced from EU membership (Aspinwall 2007).

              | However, these signs of strong support to the European integration coincide
              | with a moderate expression of criticism towards the democratic functioning of
              | EU institutions. Thus, almost 40% of the Spanish MPs declare in 2014 to be
              | somewhat or very dissatisfied with the democracy in the EU. In this respect,
              | the extent of democratic dissatisfaction is mostly explained by party affiliation,
              | as 57.6% of the PSOE MPs declares a negative assessment regarding the issue
              | (figures are similar for the other minor political parties), while 87.5 of the PP
              | representatives express the opposite view. Moreover, as Figure 2 shows, dissat-
              | HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 223
              | isfaction with the democratic working of the EU has worsened compared to the
              | initial years of the crisis. The group of individuals declaring in 2014 to be very
              | dissatisfied with democracy in the EU decreased by 11 points with respect to
              | 2009. Changes were significant both for the PP and the PSOE, though they run
              | in different directions (satisfied MPs increase in the PP and decrease in the
              | PSOE). Therefore, this deterioration of the views of the democratic working of
              | EU institutions among Spanish MPs belonging to opposition parties, expresses
              | a deeper insatisfaction with the balance of power within the EU, which during
              | the crisis has clearly turned to favour creditor countries. This is confirmed by
              | the significant increase in 2014 of the percentage of respondents who agreed
              | with the idea that EU decisions did not take into account the interests of Spain
              | (27.2% in 2009, 50% in 2014) (see below).

              | However, these criticisms have not influenced the high levels of support for EU
              | integration among Spanish MPs. Figure 3 confirms this assertion, since the
              | distribution of opinions concerning whether the EU integration process should
              | be strengthened or stopped, and the corresponding average scores (8.1 in 2007
              | and 2009, 8.0 in 2014), have hardly changed during the crisis. Party identity
              | makes again a distinction here when explaining the distribution of opinions
              | (average differences are not statistically significant): while 42,3% of PSOE
              | MPs are totally in favour (a score of 10 in a 0-10 scale) of strengthening the
              | EU, most of the conservatives parliamentarians express different degrees of
              | moderate support to this political view, with only 15% totally in favour.

              | The Cognitive-Evaluative Dimension: The Scope of EU
              | Governance
              | The evolution of MPs’ attitudes regarding the scope of governance that should
              | be developed in the EU does not differ substantially from what has been ob-
              | served for the emotive dimension in the previous section. The main trend is
              | continuity, although some slight changes along these years suggest again the
              | relevance of the influence of the party competition. For the vast majority of the
              | Spanish parliamentary elite (Figure 4), the EC must become the true govern-
              | ment of Europe (86.6%), while the powers of the EP should be strengthened
              | (85.9%) as well as those of the European Central Bank (ECB) (71.1%). Re-
              | flecting a paradoxical position, an important proportion of respondents also
              | supports the idea that states should remain central actors of the EU (65,5%).
              | This contradictory position actually suggests an interesting evolution since the
              | beginning of the crisis. Indeed, while in 2007 the support to a more parliamen-
              | tarian view of the European Union seemed to predominate (with 25 points of
              | differences between support to strengthen the EP powers and declaring that
              | states should keep their central position in the European governance), the fi-
              | nancial crisis has encouraged the support for a more executive view of the
              | governance (based on the role of the EC) to the detriment of the role of states,
              | HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 225
              | with more than 20 points of difference between both statements (Figure 4). In
              | this vein, it is interesting that the support for the ECB role7 is stronger than for
              | the role of the member states. In contrast with these opinions, the support to the
              | employment of referendum to be used as a tool to take most important EU
              | decisions is much weaker (52.6%). It does not seem that the consequences of
              | the financial crisis could have altered the view in favour of direct democracy at
              | the European level. Overall, there is a prevailing view amongst Spanish politi-

              | Party affiliation also influences decisively the views about which institutions

              | that the most important decisions concerning the EU should be taken by a
              | majority of all European citizens. In contrast, only 30.8% (most of them agree-
              | ing somewhat) of the PP representatives agrees in this democratic approach.
              | In contrast, the Eurozone crisis has clearly fuelled criticism regarding the
              | role of states’ interest in the EU’s decision-making processes (Figure 4). In-
              | deed, the amount of respondents arguing that the EU level decisions do not
              | usually take Spain’s interest into account has expanded during the observed
              | period, increasing from 17.1% (in 2007) to 49.4% (in 2014). This is congruent
              | with the strong view, shared by almost all the MPs, of the idea that the interest
              | of some countries carries too much weight in the EU (supported by 93.8% in
              | 2014). Overall, this is an indicator of how Spanish elites have perceived the
              | erosion of the position of the country (as well as other Southern European
              | countries) in the EU compared to the central role of the richest countries.

              | The financial crisis forced the EU and their state members to take action to deal
              | with the economic consequences of the crisis. The experience during this peri-
              | od may have affected opinions about how the EU should approach such chal-
              | lenges. On the one hand, there is a general consensus about need of EU finan-
              | cial aid to countries in difficulty (backed by 96.3% of the MPs). On the other
              | hand, of the different alternatives to deal with the crisis in the EU, during the
              | observed period Spanish MPs have reinforced their opinion in favour of the
              | intervention led by the EU, to the detriment of state actions or the role of inter-
              | national institutions (Figure 5). Between 2009 and 2014, the support for an
              | HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 227
              | intervention led by the EU increased (as a first or second choice amongst dif-
              | ferent alternatives) from 52.6% to 73.8%. In contrast, the choice for coordinat-
              | ed action by national governments decreased from 76.3% to 67.5%. This de-
              | cline is mainly focused on those considering this option as their first choice
              | compared to the other alternatives (51,3% in 2009). Besides, the alternative of
              | an intervention by international financial institutions has lost credit, decreasing
              | 14 percentage points, while an autonomous action by national governments is
              | the last choice for most of the parliamentarians.
              | These choices are somewhat influenced by party ideology, as PSOE MPs
              | are less likely to back the 'states only' strategy compared to conservative repre-
              | sentatives. In 2014, the autonomous action by national governments was pre-
              | ferred as first or second choice by right-wing MPs (difference +24.4) as well as
              | coordinated action of national governments (difference +11.7), while left-wing
              | MPs gave stronger support to the intervention by the EU (difference +20.2) and
              | to the role of the international fiscal institutions (difference +13.8). Moreover,
              | the effect of party ideology is particularly outstanding when the MPs come to
              | assess the role of EU institutions in the management of the Eurozone crisis.
              | While PP representatives give a positive assessment of the EU, the EC and the
              | ECB (around an average of 6.3 points on a scale 0-10), left-wing parliamentari-
              | ans express a worst opinion (average below 4 points). Finally, the ideological
              | divide is more generally reflected in the MPs’ opinions about which should be
              | the main aim of the EU. For left-wing representatives, this should be to provide
              | better social security (83.9%), while conservative MPs conceive an EU focused
              | on either making the European economy more competitive (31.8%) or on both
              | economic and social aims (40.9%).
              | The scope of governance also deals with multilevel policymaking, i.e., the
              | changing relationship between actors situated at different territorial levels and
              | how policy issues should be allocated amongst them (Jerez-Mir et al. 2010,
              | 49). In this respect, the preferences of political elites tend to follow the general
              | pro-EU support pattern observed in previous pages, with some exceptions. In
              | fact, while elites express more pro-EU positions in issues and policies dealing
              | with transnational problems, they are less conclusive in those policies tradi-
              | tionally linked with domestic issues (Real-Dato et al. 2012; Real-Dato and
              | Alarcón 2015). However, since 2009 there has been a an increase in the per-
              | centages of those respondents who prefer issues to be dealt at the EU level. We
              | may interpret this as a consequence of the failure of national and subnational
              | governments to respond to the main political challenges posed by the financial
              | crisis. This effect is general (but not necessarily homogenous) across all kind of
              | issues and policies, with two resulting patterns of evolution (see Figure 6).

              | In those issues where political elites where divided regarding which level of
              | policymaking should prevail (the EU, the national/regional level, or both),
              | there has been an increasing gap in favour of the EU in immigration, environ-
              | ment, and fight against crime. Besides, in those policy areas where the pre-
              | ferred policymaking level was the nation or the region (fighting unemployment
              | and health care policy), there has been a decline in support for those levels of
              | government parallel with an increasing preference for the intervention of the
              | EU (alone or in coordination with the other levels). One particular case is bank-
              | ing and finance regulation, where there is a strong consensus around the fun-
              | damental role of the EU in this policy area (84%).
              | In some policy issues, preferences regarding which level must prevail in
              | terms of policymaking are slightly affected by the party ideology (Real-Dato
              | and Alarcón 2015). Therefore, left-wing MPs give stronger support to the EU
              | level than the conservative representatives in issues like the unemployment
              | policy (difference +33.8%), environment (+20.2%) or crime (+19.6%), while in
              | other issues party differences are less relevant or non-existing.

              | The main exception to this general trend to reinforce the preference for the EU
              | as a central policymaking level is the security area, at least if we observe the
              | declining support for a so-called European army (Figure 7). While in 2007 the
              | preferences in this aspect were clearly in favour of European military coordina-
              | tion (with an EU army alone, or also in cooperation with national armies), only
              | HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 230
              | seven years later the situation is much less clear, with divided opinions
              | amongst Spanish MPs. We might interpret these changes as a domestic reaction
              | towards the rise of new threats to the national security, particularly the destabi-
              | lization of the Northern African countries, like Libya or Egypt, since the start
              | of the Arab Spring, or the crisis in Ukraine, and the failure of the EU to provide
              | a unified strong response to these security issues. Party ideology might help to
              | explain partially how this evolution has influenced the Spanish elite’s opinions.
              | Even though the increase of the support for the national army is consistent in
              | both left and right, the preferences for either an EU army alone or for the coex-
              | istence of armies (European and national) are substantively different along
              | party lines: while the left-wing MPs are mostly in favour of a EU army com-
              | pared to the conservatives (48% against 23.3%), the development of a EU army
              | in cooperation with national armies is the preferred option for the conservatives
              | compared to the socialdemocrats (48.8% against 20%).

              | The Projective-Conative Dimension: Perspectives on the Future
              | of the EU
              | Our analysis of the conative dimension includes three aspects of how Spanish
              | parliamentarians perceive the future of the European project and its institutions:
              | which of the policies traditionally linked to the core of state sovereignty should
              | be fully Europeanized, which threats may endanger European integration, and
              | how MPs foresee the future of the EU in the long term. These attitudes are
              | particularly relevant to understand how the financial crisis and its consequences
              | may have changed what elites expect from European integration. As Best,
              | Lengyel and Verzichelli state, “the willingness to transfer control over im-
              | portant policy areas to a supranational European level rests in a ‘progressive’
              | perception of Europe’s destiny and future purpose” (2012, 9).
              | Regarding the Europeanization of core sovereign policies (foreign policy,
              | social security, and taxation), the financial crisis has had an impact in how
              | Spanish politicians view the political evolution in these specific areas (Figure
              | 8). Generally, Spanish MPs’ preferences in most of these areas remain stable
              | compared with those in 2007 and 2009. It is the case of developing a single
              | foreign policy for all the EU members regarding non-EU states (48,1% strongly
              | in favour, 43,2% somewhat in favour), or setting a common social security for
              | the EU members (28,8% strongly in favour, 58,8% somewhat in favour). There
              | are not obviously strong differences along party lines in these policies. But in
              | the taxation area, there has been a significant change during the observed peri-
              | od. Therefore, if in 2007 the proportion of those in favour of a unified tax sys-
              | tem was slightly below 75%, in 2014 such percentage increased up to a 85.6%
              | (40.5% strongly in favour, 45.6% somewhat in favour, including almost all
              | left-wing MPs). In the same vein, there is a strong support for developing a
              | system of collectivising the national debt through the issuance of Eurobonds
              | HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 231
              | (39.5% strongly in favour, 53.9% somewhat in favour). In these policies, party
              | lines make some slight differences in the intensity of preferences (strongly vs
              | somewhat in favour) rather than between supporting or opposing the alterna-
              | tives, being left-wing MPs those who show a more favourable position for
              | common European policies.

              | There are also some signs of change in the perceived threats to the EU. In par-
              | ticular, some threats have gained relevance since 2007. The more relevant is
              | connected to the financial crisis itself and its political consequences: two thirds
              | of the respondents think economic differences among states is a big threat to
              | the sustainability of the European project in its current form, while the corre-
              | sponding percentage was only 42.1% in 2007. The economic effects of the
              | HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 232
              | crisis may also spill over the political arena, in the form of the growth of na-
              | tionalist and state-centred positions. Therefore, a 74.1% of the MPs consider a
              | big threat that some countries put its national interest first, to the detriment of
              | the collective view of the European project. This second indicator was already
              | high in 2009 (unfortunately, it was not included in the 2007 survey). This view
              | of economic inequalities and self-interested positions in states as threats to the
              | EU is not corresponded when considering other issues. Therefore, only 39.2%
              | of the interviewees considered the competition from the emerging countries as
              | a threat; 25.6% thought the same about immigration from non EU countries,
              | and 22.4% considered the enlargement of the EU to Turkey a likely danger.
              | These positions clearly depend on the party affiliation of the respondent, with
              | left-wing representatives being mostly concerned with economic inequality,
              | state self-interest and competition from emerging countries, while right-wing
              | MPs were more likely to be concerned with the other issues.
              | Conversely, almost all Spanish MPs dismiss the idea that the EU itself could
              | become a potential threat for the national culture and identity (only 2.5%
              | agreed), welfare state (13.9%), economic growth (12.7%) or the quality of
              | democracy (4.9%).

              | Finally, Figure 9 shows the results concerning the views of Spanish MPs about
              | the future general situation of the EU in 10 years. Opinions among Spanish
              | MPs are definitely optimistic, though levels of optimism differ depending on
              | the aspect of the future in consideration. Thus, while about 85% percent of
              | respondents were confident that in 10 years the EU will be politically more
              | integrated and its economy will be more robust, this percentages was lower

              | Conclusion: Stability in the Europeanness of Spanish
              | Parliamentary Elite during the Crisis
              | This article has offered an overview of several aspects of the Spanish political
              | elite’s attitudes towards the EU. We have employed the multidimensional
              | concept of Europeanness to integrate these views into a common comparative
              | analytical framework. The main results confirm that the longstanding pro-
              | European consensus among Spanish national representatives (Jerez-Mir et al.
              | 2015b) has remained almost unalterable after the harsh period of financial
              | crisis and political turbulence. And in those few cases where significant chang-
              | es in the main patterns of perceptions and expectations are detected, these
              | changes usually reveal a strengthening of the support to for a more federalist
              | view of the European project. Therefore, in 2014 the average level of trust in
              | the EP among Spanish MPs was significantly higher than in 2009. Similarly,
              | the percentages of respondents who prefer that key policy areas of contempo-
              | rary governance, particularly those that are at the core of the current European
              | debate such as taxation, finance, immigration, and environment, are decided
              | exclusively by EU institutions increased in 2014 with respect to 2009. Besides,
              | this has also become the preferred alternative for a key policy area in the do-
              | mestic arena such as fighting unemployment. In contrast, one of the more rele-
              | vant changes comparing to previous results (in the 2007-2009 IntUne project
              | data) is the deterioration of the support to the national/regional level of gov-
              | ernment as crucial reference points for decision-making (in contrast to what
              | was observed by Jerez-Mir et al. 2010, 51). However, some negative percep-
              | tions have gained relevance during the last years, related to the perception that
              | European decision-makers or the decision structure of the EU do not take
              | enough into account the interests of those countries, such as Spain, more af-
              | fected by the crisis, while the view that some countries carry too much weight
              | on EU decision making still persists. This is in line with the perception of
              | member states' self-interest and economic inequalities as the most important
              | threats to European integration.
              | The pro-EU positions among Spanish MPs is also evidenced when looking
              | at their views of the future of the EU in 10 years, where a great majority be-
              | lieves Europe will be more integrated and prosperous; and the minority repre-
              | sented by those who think the EU constitutes a danger for the country's cultur-
              | al, economic or political systems.
              | This Euro-optimism of the Spanish parliamentary elite may also have less
              | positive reading if we look at it from the perspective of the representative role
              | HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 234
              | played by Spanish parliamentary elites. As we have explained in previous
              | pages, this pro-EU consensus was built upon the stability of the representation
              | of the main political parties (even though some changes in the parliamentary
              | balance between PSOE and PP). But this stability has run in parallel to a dete-
              | rioration of some aspects of the (traditionally positive) attitudes of Spanish
              | citizens towards the EU. Such deterioration has affected mostly to the levels of
              | trust in EU institutions, support for European integration, or the benefits ob-
              | tained from the EU membership (Real-Dato 2015). This differential evolution
              | of the views of citizens seems to be producing an increasing gap between these
              | and their political representatives. This gap might be partly caused by the cog-
              | nitive differences between elites and the general public mentioned at the begin-
              | ning of this article. But also, it could be an expression of what Peter Mair has
              | called the dilemma between responsibility and responsiveness (2013, 140).
              | According to this, the emphasis on responsibility by traditional parties to the
              | detriment of responsiveness to the electorate might open a growing divide
              | between “parties which claim to represent, but don’t deliver, and those which
              | deliver, but are no longer seen to represent” (Mair 2013, 141). Unsurprisingly,
              | the increasing gap between the positions of Euro-optimistic political elites and
              | Euro-critical citizens has developed during a time when both PSOE and PP
              | governments implemented very unpopular austerity policies. In this context,
              | parties' emphasis on responsibility may have eroded the popular basis of the
              | permissive consensus that has prevailed in Spain since its entry in the EEC in
              | 1986. It could also be argued that the persistence of this gap between parties
              | and citizens could pave the way for new parties or political actors thriving on
              | popular disatisfaction with the economic and political situation and with a
              | nationalist or even Eurosceptic agenda. This might help to understand the elec-
              | toral breakthrough of a new party like Podemos in the 2014 European election,
              | which based its campaign in exploiting a highly critical discourse with the
              | political class and the austerity policies imposed by the EU, and claiming the
              | reinforcement of the role of the national institutions in Europe (Rodríguez-
              | Teruel et al. 2016). This raises interesting prospects about the implications of
              | party system change in Spain for the European project. Will the new MPs com-
              | ing from the new parties – mostly from Podemos – accommodate to traditional
              | patterns of Europeanness? Or will they transform them aiming to respond to
              | dissatisfied voters if the EU’s output-oriented legitimacy continues to deterio-
              | rate?
