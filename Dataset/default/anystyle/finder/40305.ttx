              | Abstract
              | Having in mind that Macedonian society is still in a process of democratic transition, the discussion pertaining
              | to the relevance and significance of democracy, as well as democratic awareness of its citizens, is one of the
              | most contested issues in the political and academic debates in the Republic of Macedonia. The paper
              | examines the attitudes towards democracy of the student population in the Republic of Macedonia, analyzed
              | through the following aspects: citizen participation, citizen activism and political affiliation. The project entitled
              | “Virtual and Real Identities in the Republic of Macedonia” - conducted by the Institute for Sociological,
              | Political and Juridical Research in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia, served as a basis for our research. The
              | findings suggest that the Macedonian society should pay more attention on development of democratic
              | awareness of its young people through educational system and other institutions.
              | Keywords: democracy, attitudes, citizen participation, civic activism and political affiliation.
              | 1. Introduction
              | „Democracy‟ is one of the most used and arguable concepts in more recent history, i.e. in the age of so-
              | called Third Wave of democratization and particularly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The definitions and the
              | operationalizing of this concept vary. Hence, even though there is no universally accepted definition, there are two

              | approaches in defining „democracy‟: „minimal‟ and „maximal‟. The first one focuses on the importance of „means‟, that
              | is, procedures such as fair elections, respect for human rights, and universal suffrage. In contrast, maximal
              | definitions include not only democratic procedures but also „ends‟, or outputs (such as economic equality and social
              | services) (Baviskar and Malone, 2004: 4).
              | The Republic of Macedonia gained its independence in the year 1991 following the dissolution of the
              | Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Taking into consideration the fact that it is a relatively young democratic
              | country, Macedonian society is still regarded as a society in a democratic transition1. Thus, discussion pertaining to
              | the relevance and significance of democracy, as well as democratic awareness of its citizens, is one of the most
              | contested issues in the political and academic debates in the Republic of Macedonia. The issue of the level of
              | democratic awareness of the citizens is of a great importance having in mind, in particular, the fact that a stable
              | democratic regime does not only require well-designed and functioning political institutions and processes to be
              | sustainable and consolidated, it requires democrats (Mattes et al., 1999).
              | This paper gives an insight into the democratic awareness of young people in Macedonia, in particular about
              | their attitudes, values and practices in terms of democratic principles. Our findings rely on the data from the project
              | entitled “Virtual and Real Identities in the Republic of Macedonia”, conducted by the Institute for Sociological, Political
              | and Juridical Research in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia. The project was based on the research of political
              | attitudes and identities of the student population in Macedonia, by direct surveying of respondents. The survey was
              | conducted from September 2012 until July 2013. The survey was undertaken among the students at the Universities
              | in Skopje, Bitola, Shtip and Tetovo. Three of these universities were public, while the other two were private. The
              | number of respondents in the survey is representative for the Republic of Macedonia in terms of ethnicity, gender,
              | religion, place of residence, and region2. It covered a sample of 707 respondents. General characteristics of the
              | sample were the following: 707 students from 5 state universities and 2 private universities; 256 male and 451
              | female; Macedonians 442, Albanians 239 and others 26; 201 living in rural and 504 in urban area3.
              | The survey questionnaire includes questions that explore students‟ attitudes towards democracy, in
              | particular their interest in politics and their civic engagement:
              | Q: “Are the students interested in politics?”
              | Q: “How often do they discuss about politics with their friends?”
              | Q: “Which political ideology is closest to students?”
              | Q: “Students’ willingness to participate in civic activities?”
              | Q: “Students’ engagement in civic associations?”
              | Yet, it has to be emphasized that the paper presents only preliminary analysis and evaluations of the
              | empirical findings of our institutional research project.
              | Having in mind that the paper focuses on the attitudes towards democracy of the Macedonian students, the
              | notions of „democracy‟, „citizen participation‟, and „civic activism‟ are to be further defined and elaborated on.
              | 1 According to Linz and Stepan (1996) a democratic transition is complete when a sufficient agreement has been reached about
              | political procedures to produce an elected government, when a government comes to power that is the direct result of a free and
              | popular vote, when this government de facto has the authority to generate new policies, and when the executive, legislative and
              | judicial powers generated by the new democracy does not have to share the power with the other bodies de jure.
              | 2 Despite the Macedonian majority (66, 6%) there are other ethnic communities living on the territory of the Republic of
              | Macedonia: Albanian ethnic community (22, 7%), Turkish (4, 0%), Serbian (2, 1%), Vlachs (0, 4%) and others (1, 9%). Regarding
              | the religious affiliation, 67% of the population belongs to the Christian- orthodox religion and 30% to Islam.
              | 3 According to the data of the State Statistical Office obtained on the basis of received reports, there were 57 746 enrolled
              | students in the Republic of Macedonia in the academic year 2013/2014, an increase of 1.5% compared to the academic year
              | 2012/2013. The number of enrolled female students was 31 450 or 54.5%. The majority of students, 88.5%, were enrolled in
              | public tertiary institutions, while 11.1% were enrolled in private tertiary institutions.

              | 2. Understanding Democracy
              | In political theory, „democracy‟ is described as a political philosophy, but also as a form of governing, where
              | the governing power lies in the hands of people, and it may be exercised either in an immediate (direct democracy)
              | or intermediate manner (indirect democracy), i.e. according to the principle of presentation and representation of
              | interests realized by virtue of free and fair elections. Modern or contemporary interpretation of democracy is
              | connected with the philosophical principle of equal rights. Hence, the notion of democracy is occasionally used in the
              | context of liberal democracy, which on the other hand implies existence of certain additional elements, such as
              | political pluralism, equality before the law, civil freedoms and civil rights. Furthermore, these elements represent
              | parameters regarding the level of democracy within society (Atanasov and Cvetanova, 2013: 27).
              | Different scholars define „democracy‟ in different ways. Definitions of democracy are often influenced by the
              | aspect they emphasize. For example: some of the definitions focus on the institutions and procedures of democratic
              | governance, others on political aspect i.e. freedom and liberties, and still others take into account the social
              | dimension, i.e. social benefits.
              | These three broad alternatives – institutions and procedures, freedom and liberties, and social benefits –
              | constitute the primary substantive choices in defining democracy. Certainly people will offer other responses if asked
              | to define democracy spontaneously. Yet the extent to which democracy is defined in terms of these three broad
              | choices provides a framework to assess the high levels of public support for democracy in recent public-opinion
              | surveys and the implications of these democratic aspirations. Each alternative has different implications for the
              | interpretation of public opinion toward democracy and the principles that guide the democratization process (Dalton,
              | Shin, and Jou, 2007: 145).
              | Despite many definitions and different approaches in defining democracy, political theory highlights three
              | pillars that underpin democracy: transparency, accountability and right to participate. Therefore, citizen participation –
              | as one of the three pillars - is regarded widely as vital to democracy. The classic Kantian distinction between active
              | and passive citizens implies that only those citizens who in one way or another actively participate in decision-making
              | are indeed different from the subjects of a nondemocratic polity (Weinrib, 2008).
              | Free and active participation and involvement of citizens in the political life of any country is the principal
              | characteristic of democracy. When it comes to contemporary democratic systems, citizens are allowed to discuss
              | freely their problems, express and voice their dissatisfaction and complaints and request changes. (Atanasov,
              | Cvetanova, 2013: 33).
              | Citizen participation may be defined as a process in which ordinary people take part – whether on a
              | voluntary or obligatory basis and whether acting alone or as part of a group – with the goal of influencing a decision
              | involving significant choices that will affect their community. Such participation may or may not take place within an
              | institutional framework, and it may be organized either by members of civil society (for example, through class action,
              | demonstrations citizens‟ committees, etc.) or by decision makers (for example, through referendums, parliamentary
              | commissions and mediation (André, 2010).
              | Civic activism refers to citizens‟ involvement on a voluntary basis in civic activities related to community,
              | often connected with duties and obligations, but also associated with membership in civic organizations as well as
              | participation in nonviolent demonstrations and petitions.
              | In the following chapter, attitudes towards democracy of Macedonian students will be analyzed from the
              | perspectives of their interests in politics, their political affiliation, citizen participation and civic activism.
              | 3. Findings and Discussion
              | For reasons pertaining to the project goals, and in order to examine attitudes towards democracy of the
              | student population in the Republic of Macedonia, a questionnaire – divided into logical groups – has been designed.
              | The first group of questions obtained data for the student‟ interest in politics: “How often they talk about
              | political issues”, and “What is their ideological affiliation”.
              | On the question “Are you interested in politics?” most of the students declared that they are partially
              | interested in politics 48.7%, very interested are 18.2% whereas 32.9% are not interested. Considering the variable

              | “Faculties”, the greatest interest in politics is observed in students studying Political science and students of Law
              | faculties, which confirms the expectations with regard to the data analysis. However, when the data is discussed in
              | terms of “Ethnicity” and “Gender”, there is a statistically significant difference.
              | From the aspect of ethnicity, 26.4% of the respondents that belong to Albanian ethnic community are very
              | interested in politics, whereas the Macedonians are only 14.1% very interested.
              | Figure 1.
              | Q: “Are you interested in politics?” (Ethnic Variable)
              | The increased interest in politics among the students that belong to Albanian ethnic community, as opposed
              | to Macedonians, is probably due to the fact that they consider the Implementation of the Ohrid Framework
              | Agreement4 i.e. the resolving ethnic issues as an open, and still ongoing process.
              | An interesting fact is that male students are more interested in politics then female students. Hence, very
              | interested in politics are 28.6% male students and 12.2% of the female, partly interested are 49% of male and 48.4%
              | of female students, and generally not interested are 22.4% of male and 38.9% of female students.
              | 4 The Ohrid Framework Agreement ended the seven-month armed conflict between the Albanian Paramilitary Formation called
              | National Liberation Army and Macedonian security forces in 2001. The objective of the Agreement was to meet the requirements
              | on the part of the Albanian ethnic community in Macedonia, but at the same time for the purpose of preserving the unitary
              | character of the state. The Document incorporated both general principles and suggestions for solving concrete interethnic
              | problems, such as: decentralization, non-discrimination in public service, special parliamentary procedures for changing the
              | constitution and other major laws, education and language matters, as well as the expression of identity. The Agreement was
              | implemented in the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Macedonia.

              | Q: “Are you interested in politics?” (Gender Variable)
              | A lack of interest in politics among female students could be interpreted in the light of general negative
              | attitude to women and their representation and participation in politics due to the traditional and conservative values
              | which are typical for the cultural background of the people living in Macedonia. This negative attitude is reflected in
              | the number of women in politics which is significantly lower compared to the number of men, particularly in terms of
              | the executive and local government.5
              | How often students discuss political issues with their friends is one of the indicators that show are they really
              | interested in politics. To this question 17.8% choose the answer “very often”, 19.8% answers “never”, and 61.6% of
              | the students “sometimes” discuss about politics.
              | 5 None of the governments in the Republic of Macedonia, since the very independence and continuing to present date, has had
              | more than two female ministers in its government structure. As far as their representation and participation in the local self-
              | government is concerned, in the course of the latest local elections held in the year 2014, fewer than five percent of the
              | candidates running for the office of mayor were women, and only 4 (3,4%) of them were elected a mayor. The increased
              | percentage of women represented in the legislative power is primarily due to the changes introduced to the Election Law. In
              | compliance with these changes, when submitting their list of candidates for members of parliament the political parties are to
              | adhere to their legal obligation stipulating that every third candidate is to be female. Such an obligation secures and guarantees
              | a greater representation of women in the legislative power.

              | politics, 47,8 % of this category sometimes discuss about political issues.

              | The existence of various political options with different ideological affiliation lays the foundation of a
              | pluralistic form of democratic rule. Hereunder is presented the ideological orientation of the Macedonian students and
              | the ratio of the left wing, right wing or center-oriented.
              | Figure 4.
              | Q: “Which political ideology is closest to you?”
              | The majority of Macedonians students do not declare their ideological affiliation, i.e. a high percentage of
              | 46.8% of the respondents stated that they do not belong to any political option. The percentage of the respondents
              | that declared themselves as center-oriented amounts to 19.5%, whereas 10.4% characterized themselves as right
              | wing-oriented and 13.9% as left wing-oriented.
              | With reference to the three aforementioned political options, most of the Macedonian students have
              | declared themselves as center-oriented. Nevertheless, in the course of almost all parliamentary elections held in the
              | Republic of Macedonia these political parties had significantly fewer voters compared to the left wing and right wing
              | political parties.
              | Concerning the fact that the majority of Macedonian students are politically and ideologically undeclared, it
              | may be interpreted in two ways. The students are insufficiently informed and educated with regard to the basic
              | principles and postulates of the different political ideologies or they cannot perceive and differentiate the ideological
              | affiliation when it comes to the activities undertaken by the left-wing and right-wing parties present on the political
              | stage in the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, even though they are very precise concerning their ideological affiliation
              | in their respective political platforms, when it comes to their activities, they do not always adhere to their policies (in
              | particular pertaining to welfare and economy) which are distinctive and distinguishable for the political option they
              | belong to.
              | Democracy represents a system of governing in which the expression of dissatisfaction regarding a given
              | governmental politics, decision or state is a legitimate right to each and every citizen without being intimidated by any
              | consequences (Atanasov, Cvetanova, 2013: 31). The willingness of the students to be active in initiating social and
              | political issues will be shown through the next group of questions.

              | Each question refers to a different type of civic activity: to sign a petition for social or political issue; to
              | participate in setting up social or political demands; to participate in political and social protests that are legally
              | allowed.

              | To sign a petition for social or political issues;
              | To participate in setting up social or political demands;
              | To participate to political and social protests legally allowed.
              | Figure 5 shows that all three types of civic activities do not affect the distribution of responses. It means that
              | all types of activities are equally acceptable (almost 43%) for the students. Yet, when it comes to the response “not
              | acceptable”, there is difference in the percentages:

              | Hence, it should be noted that this answers reflect only the willingness of the students to take participation in
              | such activities. Hence, the question whether the students have already taken part in such civic activities - remains
              | open.
              | The engagement in civic associations gives the students opportunity to raise issues related to community,
              | social and political life, thus contributing to the general development of the society. Having in mind the fact that active
              | participation in civic organizations is one of the indicators that determine the level of democratic awareness, the
              | students were asked about their membership and activities in civic organizations and association.
              | Figure 6.
              | Q: “Are you a member of any organization or association?”
              | From the total number of the respondents, a major part (almost 70%) consists in members of civic
              | associations opposed to 31.4% that are not members of any.
              | The highest percentages of students are members of Sports clubs (24.3%) and Student associations
              | (22.7%), followed by Youth organizations (12.7%); Cultural and art organizations (12.6%); Humanitarian
              | organizations (9.7%); and Political parties (9.4%). Students are least interested in organizations for Environmental
              | protection (5%), Associations for animal‟s protection (3.9%) and Peace movements (2.4%).
              | 4. Limitations of the Current Approach
              | The paper has some limitations. A major, though natural limitation comes from the fact that in this paper
              | only preliminary analysis and evaluations of the empirical findings of our institutional research project are presented.
              | Another limitation is the lack of comparative analytical perspective involving some other dimensions, such as:

              | cohort; comparison of students that are interested in politics with those that are not interested in terms of their
              | political and civic engagement; comparison of students who are politically determined and those who are not in terms
              | of their political and civic engagement, etc. Further research should be undertaken in order to investigate the
              | analytical perspective on these topics.
              | 5. Conclusions and Further Developments
              | Republic of Macedonia is a relatively young democratic state. Therefore, discussion pertaining to the
              | relevance and significance of democracy, as well as democratic awareness of its citizens, is one of the most
              | contested issues in the political and academic debates in the Republic of Macedonia. In this paper, the attitudes
              | towards democracy of Macedonian students were analyzed through the prism of their interest in politics, their political
              | affiliation, citizen participation and civic activism.
              | The analyzed data provided a clearer image of the Macedonian students‟ attitudes. The data enabled us to
              | gain an insight into the political affiliation on the part of Macedonian students, their civic activities and to what extent
              | they are interested in politics.
              | By virtue of the results obtained in the course of the conducted survey, we may reach the following general
              | conclusions about the attitudes towards democracy of Macedonian students:
              | Most of the students declared that they are partially interested in politics;
              | Students that belong to Albanian ethnic community are twice more “very interested in politics” than the
              | Macedonians;
              | Male students are more interested in politics then female;
              | Although 48,7% of the students declared that are not interested in politics, 47,8 % of this category
              | sometimes discuss political issues;
              | The majority of Macedonians students are undeclared when it comes to their ideological affiliation;
              | Despite the fact that most of the Macedonian students have declared themselves as centre-oriented, in the
              | course of almost all parliamentary elections held in the Republic of Macedonia these political parties had significantly
              | fewer votes compared to the left wing and right wing political parties;
              | All types of civic activities (to sign a petition for social or political issue, participation in setting up social or
              | political demands and participation in political and social protests that are legally allowed) are equally acceptable for
              | the students;
              | Many respondents (the vast number of the total respondents) are members of civic associations.
              | The highest percentages of students are members of Sports clubs and Student associations.
              | The students are least interested in organizations for Environmental protection, Associations for animal‟s
              | protection and Peace movements.
              | The Republic of Macedonia is still paving its own way to democratic transition. In order to have a stable
              | democratic regime, beside the well-designed and functioning political institutions and processes, we also need
              | democrats. Hence, we may come to a general conclusion that Macedonian society should pay more attention on
              | development of democratic awareness of the young people, through deployment of all disposable capacities and
              | potentials, in particularly the educational system, the overall civil society, as well as the political elites.
