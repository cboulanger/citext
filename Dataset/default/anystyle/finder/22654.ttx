              | Introduction
              | This special issue examines a number of key issues in cultural theory
              | through the development of, and reaction to, a popular television charac-
              | ter, the vampire Spike from the cult television success Buffy the Vampire
              | Slayer. As the latest in a long line of sympathetic vampires, Spike’s textual
              | construction rearticulates the dualities which fictional vampires have long
              | embodied: the simultaneous expression of erotic repulsion and attraction;
              | a fear of and desire for the ‘Other’; the ambivalences of a troubling ontol-
              | ogy figured through a creature that is neither dead nor alive. As Nina
              | Auerbach has stated: ‘Vampires are neither inhuman nor nonhuman nor
              | all-too-human; they are simply more alive than they should be’ (1995: 6).
              | Like his fictional ancestors, Spike blurs boundaries and raises ambiguities,
              | but he does so in a manner firmly located in today’s cultural landscape.
              | Spike joins Buffy the Vampire Slayer in Season 2 with a swagger and a
              | vulnerability which alludes to the many oppositions that he will come to
              | unsettle. Spike is polymorphous: he is both man and monster, both
              | masculine and feminine; and his increasingly fractured self undermines
              | the Manichaean struggle which is central to so much of today’s popular
              | culture.
              | Spike’s character also raised important questions about the boundaries
              | of the text. Our understanding of Spike depends upon a number of extra-
              | textual factors: intertextual pop culture references; allusions to musical
              | subcultures; and knowledge of the actor James Marsters, who plays him.
              | Spike has spawned a huge fan culture and his audience appeal suggests
              | that he articulates a number of cultural issues, of which this special issue

              | examines several in depth. However, in this introduction we would like to
              | provide some contextual background to the television show in which Spike
              | comes to such prominence, and offer a way into the text for those
              | unfamiliar with it.
              | Buffy the Vampire Slayer (aka Buffy or BtVS) first appeared in 1992 as
              | a film. It was written by Joss Whedon, directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui and
              | started Kristy Swanson as the eponymous heroine – high-school student
              | by day, but vampire slayer by night. The film was not a huge success, but
              | in 1997 the character of Buffy returned to TV (played by Sarah Michelle
              | Gellar) and became a huge hit. This time Joss Whedon was more firmly
              | in control as creator, executive producer and (on occasion) writer and
              | director. In the words of Jane Espenson, one of the show’s writers, ‘it is so
              | Joss’s show’ (2004: 101), and it is his creative vision that has to be held to
              | account for the success of the TV show when the film had made such little
              | impact.
              | Whedon has argued that it was always his intention that Buffy should
              | become an iconic show. In an oft-quoted interview he said:
              | I designed the show to create that strong reaction. I designed Buffy to be an
              | icon, to be an emotional experience, to be loved in a way that other shows can’t
              | be loved. Because it’s about adolescence, which is the most important thing
              | people go through in their development, becoming an adult. And it mythol-
              | ogizes it in such a way, such a romantic way – it basically says, ‘Everybody who
              | made it through adolescence is a hero.’ And I think that’s very personal, that
              | people get something from that that’s very real. (quoted in Lavery, 2004: 4)
              | Within the world of cult TV Whedon has become regarded as genius/
              | auteur (Lavery, 2002) helming not only Buffy (1997–2003), but its spin-off
              | series Angel (1999–2004) and the ill-fated Firefly (2002). All three series
              | have received critical acclaim and have become the subject of fan devotion.
              | At the beginning of 2005, the website Buffysearch.com listed a total of
              | 3973 sites dedicated to Buffy and Angel, including 1094 general BtVS sites,
              | 627 sites featuring fan fiction from the two series and 612 sites focusing on
              | the cast. Of these, 68 focus on Spike and/or James Marsters, with only
              | Buffy and/or Sarah Michelle Gellar herself having more fan sites.
              | In addition, Whedon’s work has attracted considerable academic
              | attention. Speaking at the 2004 Slayage Conference on Buffy the Vampire
              | Slayer, David Lavery (co-editor of the first academic book on Buffy –
              | Fighting the Forces: What’s at Stake in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) claimed
              | that ‘Buffy studies’ ‘comprised at least fifty disciplines, methods, and/or
              | approaches’ and Sue Turnbull (2004) has noted that there are at least 12
              | serious academic books on Buffy and an (online) international journal.
              | There have already been three international conferences on the show, in
              | the UK, Australia and the US. This year will see a further conference held
              | at the Centre for Constructions and Identities at the University of
              | 276 Huddersfield on ‘Social Life, Human Experience and the Works of Joss

              | Whedon’ and a 2006 conference, again focusing on the oeuvre of Whedon,
              | is to be held in Nashville, TN.
              | Despite the demise of Buffy in 2003 (after seven seasons and a total of
              | 144 episodes) and Angel in 2004 (after five seasons and 110 episodes),
              | interest in both shows and their characters remains unabated and the
              | show is an ongoing, international phenomenon. In fact, in the US, revenue
              | creation and audience interest in TV shows only begins with the network
              | run, which is followed by syndication and then sales of DVDs, videos and
              | related merchandise. Today in the US Buffy the Vampire Slayer reruns are
              | shown twice a week in syndication on the cable channel FX and numerous
              | local affiliates. Indeed, according to Nielsen ratings, the weekend debut of
              | Buffy the Vampire Slayer in broadcast syndication in October 2001 was
              | the highest rating premiere of an off-network weekly rerun since ER in
              | 1998.1
              | Furthermore, reruns currently air on terrestrial, cable and satellite
              | channels in over a dozen European countries, a number of Latin American
              | and South American countries, and at least one Arab TV channel. The
              | show continues to be a thriving source of licensing and merchandising
              | revenue, with large numbers of websites selling everything from DVDs,
              | video games, posters, photos, stickers, patches and jewellery, to life-size
              | cardboard stand-up figures of the show’s stars, mobile phone ringtones,
              | stationery sets, spin-off novels, guidebooks and fridge magnets. Both Buffy
              | the Vampire Slayer and Angel continue to be important players in the
              | media world and audience interest in both shows and their characters
              | remains high.
              | Buffy (and Spike) for beginners
              | But what exactly is Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Apart from the reasons given
              | by Joss Whedon that we have quoted, why did the show become such a
              | phenomenal success? As stated in the show’s title, Buffy herself is the
              | ‘vampire slayer’. In the mythology of the series, this means that she is the
              | one girl who has been chosen to defend the world: as the opening voiceover
              | to many of the early episodes states, ‘She alone will stand against the
              | vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness’. Yet the voiceover is
              | misleading – for Buffy is not alone. Unlike earlier Slayers, Buffy breaks
              | the mould by having a range of friends and allies who help her in her
              | fight. From the outset she has loyal friends – Willow and Xander. These
              | two form the core of the group known in the ‘Buffyverse’ (the colloquial
              | term used to describe the diegetic world of Buffy) as the Scooby Gang, or
              | ‘Scoobies’, in homage to the TV show Scooby Doo (premiered 1969). Over
              | the course of the seven seasons of the show additional characters come and
              | go, including Cordelia, Oz, Riley, Anya and Tara. In Season 5 Buffy also
              | acquires a sister, Dawn. In addition to these characters, Buffy is able to call
              | on the services of a mentor, Rupert Giles (generally known as Giles) sent 277
              |                                8 ( 3 )
              | by the Council of Watchers (a mysterious organization that oversees the
              | world of the vampire slayer).
              | There is also Angel, a vampire since the mid-1700s who, at the end of
              | the 19th century, is cursed by gypsies with a soul that leads him to repent
              | of his evil-doing and to side with Buffy. Of course in the ‘Buffyverse’ (as
              | in all serial TV, which relies on long drawn-out story arcs) things are never
              | this simple. Each season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer generally revolves
              | around a drawn-out battle between Buffy and the Scoobies and one major
              | enemy (known in ‘Buffyspeak’ as the ‘Big Bad’).2 In Season 2 (1997–8) the
              | Big Bad turns out to be Angel who, having experienced a ‘moment of true
              | happiness’ through sex with Buffy, loses his soul and turns on Buffy and
              | her friends.3 However, Angel does not turn into Buffy’s nemesis until part
              | way through the season (episode 14).4 For the first part of the season
              | viewers are misled into thinking that Buffy’s key enemy this year is to be
              | another vampire – Spike. Spike’s evolving role in this season marks his
              | move from one of the show’s expendable adversaries to one of its central
              | and most enduring characters (see Hills and Williams, in this issue, for
              | more on Spike’s transition from guest appearance to regular cast member).
              | Spike’s first appearance is in the episode ‘School Hard’ (2:3). He is
              | shown arriving in Sunnydale with his long-time girlfriend (and fellow-
              | vampire) Drusilla. According to the narrative, Drusilla is weak, having
              | been set upon by a mob in Prague, and Spike has brought her to Sunnydale
              | (which in the mythology of the show has been built over the Hellmouth,
              | the site of convergence for a range of evil and mystical forces) in order to
              | restore her to health. From the very beginning we are told that there is a
              | connection between the two vampires Angel and Spike, with Spike
              | describing Angel as his sire, ‘You were my sire, man! You were my . . .
              | Yoda’5 (see below for the way that the series rewrites their history). As
              | Spike was intended only as a temporary villain he is inactive for much of
              | the latter part of Season 2, coming to prominence only in the final two
              | episodes when he helps Buffy to defeat the now-evil Angel (who, when he
              | reverts to his original vampire ego, takes the name of Angelus). Spike
              | appears in only one episode of Season 3, but returns as a key character
              | from Season 4 onwards when he becomes the main vampire character
              | (Angel having departed for his own show). And when Buffy finally
              | finishes its seven-year run in 2003, Spike migrates to the spin-off show
              | Angel for its final year.
              | Spike’s story arc in Buffy is compelling, and as the show progresses we
              | find out more about his history (shown to the audience through the use of
              | flashback). William, Spike’s human incarnation, was born into a middle-
              | class Victorian household. As we find out from the episodes ‘Fool for Love’
              | (5:7) and ‘Lies My Parents Told Me’ (7:17) he was shy and retiring, fond
              | (perhaps overly fond) of his mother, and given to writing ‘bloody awful’
              | poetry – much of it dedicated to his unrequited love for Cecily. One
              | 278 evening in 1880, after being rejected by Cecily, who has told him that she
              |    -                   :

              | can never love him because he is her social inferior, he ventures into the
              | street where he is lured into an alley by the vampire Drusilla. In this
              | flashback it is Drusilla who (in a revision of the storyline from Season 2)
              | sires him. Free of his mortal incarnation, William reinvents himself as
              | ‘Spike’, adopting a working-class persona and becoming a fearsome killer.
              | Over the course of more than 100 years he makes himself the scourge of
              | Europe, and manages to kill two of Buffy’s Slayer predecessors – one in
              | 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion in China and another in New York in
              | 1977.
              | However, Spike’s murderous persona begins to alter slowly in relation
              | to Buffy, initially in Season 2 when, for personal reasons, he helps her
              | defeat the evil Angelus. His permanent return to the show in Season 4 sees
              | Spike rendered harmless to humans when a covert group of government
              | operatives (the ‘Initiative’) implant a ‘chip’ in his brain which prevents
              | Spike from harming humans. He finds, however, that the chip does not
              | prevent him harming other demons and vampires so, as an outlet for his
              | violence, he finds himself an unlikely ally to Buffy and the Scoobies. By
              | Season 5 he has fallen in love with Buffy although, not surprisingly, his
              | affection is not returned (in an echo of his relationship with Cecily, Buffy
              | tells Spike he is beneath her). By the end of Season 5 he is willing to give
              | his life to save Buffy and her sister Dawn, but it is Buffy who makes this
              | sacrifice and dies.
              | Resurrected in Season 6 (brought back from the dead by a spell from
              | Willow, who has become a powerful Wicca) Buffy finds herself increas-
              | ingly isolated from her friends and turns to Spike for comfort, embarking
              | on a passionate but soulless relationship. When she finally renounces this
              | relationship Spike endeavours to re-ignite it, but ends up attempting to
              | rape her. This act provokes a crisis of conscience that results in Spike
              | departing for Africa where, after a series of trials, he is able to win back his
              | soul (see Abbott, in this issue, for more on the ambiguity surrounding this
              | development). Season 7 sees the newly-ensouled Spike return to
              | Sunnydale and attempt to rebuild his relationship with the Slayer, once
              | again fighting at her side as she faces the greatest challenge of her life – a
              | battle against the ‘First Evil’. The season ends with Spike sacrificing his
              | life to save the world. If this echoes Buffy’s sacrifice at the end of Season 5
              | then his return on the spin-off show Angel echoes her resurrection (see
              | Wilcox (2002) for a more detailed analysis of parallels between Spike and
              | Buffy). In the early episodes of Angel Season 5, Spike is quite literally a
              | ghost of his former self. But recorporealized he joins Angel’s side in, once
              | again, fighting evil (albeit reluctantly). The final episode of the final
              | series of Angel (‘Not Fade Away’, A5:22) sees Spike in an alley alongside
              | Angel facing seemingly insuperable odds. The show ends as the battle is
              | about to commence – Spike’s ultimate fate remains unknown.
              | Spike’s character progression (or ‘arc’ as Whedon and his scriptwriters
              | prefer) throughout Buffy the Vampire Slayer comes to represent the show’s 279

              | key themes of angst and outsiderdom perhaps more fully than that of any
              | other character. All of the central characters in Buffy the Vampire Slayer
              | are, as Roz Kaveney (2004: 7) puts it, ‘refugees from hierarchy of one sort
              | or another’. Buffy’s best friend Willow is a high-school geek turned
              | Wiccan, who has a lesbian relationship with Tara, herself an exile from an
              | oppressive patriarchal family. The other prominent (and permanent)
              | character in the Scooby Gang, Xander, is depicted as a ‘loser’ both in terms
              | of his high-school experience and his masculine identity. He eventually
              | finds love with a fallen vengeance demon, Anya, only to abandon her at
              | the altar. Even Buffy herself, locked into a role as the Slayer which is
              | beyond her control, is depicted as an outcast. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is
              | concerned centrally with the issue of outsiderdom, both in terms of its
              | character portrayal and in individual episodes (‘Out of Sight, Out of Mind
              | [a.k.a. Invisible Girl]’, 1:11; ‘Earshot’, 3:18). However, it is Spike who
              | expresses this marginality most completely, as even members of the
              | Scooby Gang generally want nothing to do with him. He is, in effect, the
              | outcast’s outcast.
              | Not only does Spike express the marginality associated with the
              | fictional vampire more generally (neither dead nor alive, a figure on the
              | edges of humanity), he is an outcast in a fictional world that otherwise
              | embraces marginal social identities, and in a show that speaks to and from
              | the experience of outsiderdom. Shunned even by the Scoobies – them-
              | selves social outcasts – Spike suffers an extreme form of outsiderdom and

              | figure and the enormous fandom which surrounds him, for Spike’s
              | character fully articulates that which makes Buffy the Vampire Slayer such
              | a cult success – the experience of the outcast and the pain of liminality, of
              | not belonging. Williamson (in this issue) will explore this aspect of the
              | show’s, and in particular Spike’s, appeal in more depth.
              | Buffy – unsettling the codes of representation
              | Buffy the Vampire Slayer may have started out as teen TV dealing with the
              | trials of adolescence, but – as the number of books and articles that the
              | show has generated testifies – quickly transcended this generic label to
              | develop a cult following among audiences of all ages. Perhaps the key
              | reason for this is that while, at its literal level, it functions as a coming-of-
              | age story about a girl with superpowers, at the metaphorical level it deals
              | with many of the fundamental themes of existence that haunt the post-
              | modern condition (see, for example, South, 2003; Wilcox and Lavery,
              | 2002; and the numerous contributions to the online journal Slayage;
              | http://www.slayage.tv). Jean-Francois Lyotard (1984: xxiv) has summed
              | up the postmodern condition as ‘incredulity toward metanarrative’, and
              | certainly metanarratives of good and evil, the human and the monstrous,

              | systematically in a show that is formally structured around ‘good’ versus
              | ‘evil’. Each of the Scoobies in some way blurs these distinctions (for
              | example, Willow’s witchcraft spins out of control and becomes an addic-
              | tion; Buffy kills Ted, who she suspects is a monster but who might be
              | human), but it is Spike who disrupts them most fully. Spike’s ambiguity
              | and his movement between the poles of good and evil, human and
              | monstrous, upset the dichotomies on which modern Manichaean thinking
              | rests.
              | Spike’s character also unsettles the metanarratives regarding the
              | wholeness of the ‘self ’. Spike’s character poses interesting questions about
              | the ‘self ’ in our time in ways which resonate with the experience of
              | marginality, but which also raise questions about the fractured self. Just as
              | Spike expresses the outcast more fully than any other character in the
              | show’s ensemble, so too does he embody most fully the predicaments of a
              | fractured subjectivity: the idea that we have not one, but multiple
              | identities, which contend for dominance and that our subjectivities are
              | neither fixed nor stable over the course of our lives. The way in which this
              | applies to Spike is made clear in many of the articles in this issue, but
              | receives perhaps its fullest expression in Abbott’s detailed study of his
              | character in Season 7.
              | Even more challengingly, Spike’s character explores the ambiguity of
              | gender and the pleasures of the queer self, and most fully blurs the
              | persistent binary narrative governing representations of gender and
              | sexuality. Both Buffy and Angel are populated with figures who seek to
              | question traditional modes of classification, who undergo unexpected
              | transformations and who embody the polymorphous perverse (as taken
              | from Freud, but with an attempt to strip the notion of any pathological
              | connotations). Indeed, the key to the appeal of the ‘Buffyverse’ is the way
              | in which it invites the notion that binary ways of thinking are redundant.
              | The possibilities offered by challenging binary constructions of gender are
              | articulated most completely through the body of Spike. Indeed, it seems as
              | though Spike’s character performs that which other characters in the
              | series (and other sympathetic vampires in history) only promise. Where
              | other character pairings in Buffy the Vampire Slayer only promise the
              | pleasures of homosexual and/or queer desire that are never realised,
              | Spike acts out erotic desire in a manner that undermines heterosexual/
              | homosexual and masculine/feminine binaries. As this issue will demon-
              | strate, Spike thereby exemplifies Braidotti’s ‘nomadic subject’, ‘a myth,
              | that is to say a political fiction, that allows [me] to move across established
              | categories and levels of experience: blurring boundaries without burning
              | bridges’ (1994: 4).
              | In the sense that Spike acts out erotic desire, he has a great deal in
              | common with the 19th-century lesbian vampire (despite his male
              | identity). Nina Auerbach (1995) suggests that unlike her male counter-
              | parts, the lesbian vampire Carmilla (Le Fanu, 1991[1872]) performs the 281

              | promises of the sympathetic vampire, ‘she arouses, she pervades, she offers
              | a sharing of the self. This female vampire is licensed to realize the erotic,
              | interpenetrative friendship male vampires aroused and denied’ (1995: 39).
              | While the erotic relationship between the vampire Angel and Buffy
              | results in the reanimation of Angel’s bad self, Angelus, which amounts to
              | a refusal of interpenetrative intimacy and a reassertion of gender bound-
              | aries, Buffy’s pairing with Spike is far more fluid and complex. Like the
              | lesbian vampire of more than a century earlier, Spike is capable of an
              | intimacy and a sharing of the self that other males in the series (even other
              | sympathetic vampires) cannot accomplish. Thus Spike absolutely blurs
              | the line between male and female desire, and between homosexual and
              | heterosexual desire.
              | Spike, intertextuality and kinship
              | As befits its status as a canonical popular text of postmodernity, Buffy quite
              | deliberately courts an intertextuality that addresses the knowing fan-
              | reader. Seeking to supersede the vampire chronicles of Anne Rice as the
              | defining vampire text of the late 20th century, Buffy’s vampires mock the
              | portrayal offered by Rice. But at the same time the show acknowledges her
              | influence – for by making Angel Spike’s ‘sire’ it knowingly reproduces the
              | relationship between Lestat and Louis. At this point Spike is cast in the
              | role of Louis, but as befits the complexity of the ‘Buffyverse’ this identi-
              | fication is rapidly called into question. As Williamson argues in the first
              | article in this issue, Spike may be the more junior of the two vampires, but
              | at the point in time at which we encounter these two it is he, not Angel,
              | who takes the role of the modernized, sceptical vampire who does not
              | abide by the traditionally sanctioned vampire law embodied by Lestat (see
              | Gelder, 1994). This is summed up in Spike’s penultimate line in ‘School
              | Hard’ – ‘From now on, we’re gonna have a little less ritual and a little
              | more fun around here’. Much later in the show’s history (in a flashback in
              | ‘Lies My Parents Told Me’) there is a further nod to Spike-as-Lestat when
              | we find that, on becoming a vampire, one of Spike’s first acts is to ‘sire’ his
              | mother.6 As befits the non-normative kinship of vampire families, the son
              | gives the gift of unlife to the woman who gave him life.
              | Yet the show subsequently denies the erotic reading of the Angel/Spike
              | relationship implied by the initial Lestat/Louis intertextual reference.
              | Siring has always been a metaphor for sexual intercourse, as Rice’s
              | description of Louis’ siring at the hands of Lestat makes clear. Gelder
              | comments that Lestat ‘takes’ Louis like a lover in a ‘drawn-out ecstatic
              | moment which has them mingling their fluids together’ (Gelder, 1994:
              | 112). It is perhaps for this reason that, when we get to see Spike’s siring in
              | flashback in the Season 5 episode ‘Fool for Love’, the show rewrites its own
              | history to make Drusilla Spike’s progenitor (although, as so often, this
              | 282 show has it both ways with a scene shortly afterwards showing Angel(us)

              | straddling Spike and holding a stake to his chest in a classic gesture of
              | phallic mastery). Moreover, the homoerotic reading of the relationship
              | between Angel and Spike resurfaces with a vengeance in the volume of fan
              | writing that surrounds the show and provides a parallel to the canonical
              | text.
              | ‘Fool for Love’ is a notable episode in that it makes explicit the queer
              | nature of the vampire family within the ‘Buffyverse’. Of course, queer
              | vampire families are nothing new. Gelder explores the nature of the
              | family ties between Lestat, Louis and Claudia (and beyond to the original
              | vampire ‘parents’ Enkil and Akasha) in Rice’s Vampire Chronicles (Gelder,
              | 1994) and questions of family feature in the cult vampire films of the
              | 1980s such as Near Dark (Kathryn Bigelow, 1987) and The Lost Boys (Joel
              | Schumacher, 1987). However, the family dynamics in the ‘Buffyverse’
              | take questions of kinship to a new level in the very complex relationship
              | between Angel, Spike and Drusilla and a fourth vampire, Darla (the
              | woman who sires Angelus in the 18th century). But the real point about
              | kinship in the ‘Buffyverse’ is that queer kinship extends beyond vampire
              | families and into the world of the human characters. Judith Butler has
              | argued that:
              | If we understand kinship as a set of practices that institutes relationships of
              | various kinds which negotiate the reproduction of life and the demands of
              | death, then kinship practices will be those that emerge to address fundamental
              | forms of human dependency, which may include birth, child-rearing, relations
              | of emotional dependency and support, generational ties, illness, dying, and
              | death (to name a few). (Butler, 2004: 102–3)
              | If we accept Butler’s definition of kinship practices then one of the most
              | meaningful aspects of Whedon’s work (and this applies to Buffy, Angel
              | and Firefly) is the opportunity that it offers to explore the complexities of
              | affiliation which govern non-normative communities of support – thus
              | further complicating the dynamics of gender and sexuality underpinning
              | the show(s). This definition of kinship also chimes within fandom, as fans
              | often understand their practices to be part of forming alternative commu-
              | nities (see Bacon-Smith, 1992; Jenkins, 1992), and creating ‘cyber families’
              | (Williamson, 2005: 212).
              | About this special issue
              | Williamson opens this special issue by exploring what Spike has in
              | common with a much longer tradition of sympathetic vampires and,
              | drawing on empirical research, she examines the appeal of this figure to
              | fans of the vampire. Offering an historical overview of the evolution of the
              | sympathetic vampire, she explores how this figure entered the 20th
              | century as one of empathy whose ‘Otherness’ does not provoke fear, but 283

              | rather is often that which we recognize in ourselves. Williamson suggests
              | that Spike is both constructed and read through these historical and inter-
              | textual modes, but that he updates the appeal of Otherness in significant
              | ways. For example, unlike previous incarnations of the vampire, the cult
              | TV text from which Spike emerges deliberately encourages audiences to
              | acknowledge and play with its many intertextual references to previous
              | vampires; it encourages a fannish immersion in the text by constructing
              | the text as subtext, with deliberate textual winks and nods, and extended
              | plotlines which dwell on their own convoluted construction. The inter-
              | textual and sub-textual nature of the show is revealed most through
              | Spike’s construction and is clearly identifiable in the relationship between
              | Spike and Buffy, which draws on the ‘subtextual’ conventions of the ‘slash
              | fiction’ written by fans. In this sense the text offers the polymorphous
              | sexuality (through Spike) that is usually the realm of erotic fan fiction.
              | In the second piece in this volume, Amy-Chinn argues that this poly-
              | morphous sexuality is one of the many ways in which Spike transgresses
              | boundaries. She contends that Spike does not simply subvert gender norms
              | or sexual norms, but that Spike is ‘queer’. Amy-Chinn deconstructs the
              | artificial boundary between gender and sexuality through which trans-
              | gression has previously been theorized in order to demonstrate that
              | Spike’s ‘queerness’ operates through his erotic mobility. Spike’s sexuality
              | and gender are simultaneously intertwined and fluid – he performs
              | excessive masculinity and active femininity. Yet while his biological
              | maleness is never in doubt, what it signifies is endlessly shifting. Amy-
              | Chinn examines not only the ways in which Spike switches between male
              | and female, but also his ability to accommodate ‘vanilla’ sex and erotic
              | variation.
              | For example, Spike’s relationship with Buffy is often based on Spike
              | taking the traditional ‘woman’s part’ (a desire for intimacy) and Buffy
              | taking the ‘man’s part’ (sex followed by flight) and it is one based on
              | polymorphous sexual desire on both their parts. Spike refuses to define
              | their encounters as abject or degrading, despite the fact that he is rejected
              | and abused by Buffy. But, Amy-Chinn argues, it is the power imbalance in
              | their relationship (with Buffy firmly in the driving seat), rather than their
              | unconventional and socially unacceptable sex life, that makes their
              | relationship a failure. She also insists that the show has an ambivalent
              | attitude to the ‘queerness’ it depicts by locating it in Spike, who for most
              | of the seven seasons is a figure of revulsion. However, Amy-Chinn suggests
              | that for all of its hesitations, the depiction of Spike is one that contributes
              | to the breakdown of gender oppositions, and to the visibility of uncon-
              | ventional erotic practices, thus unsettling the prevailing heteronormative
              | matrix and contributing to the ‘thinkability’ of traditionally taboo
              | practices.
              | In the third article, Abbott elaborates upon the way in which Spike
              | 284 updates the conventions associated with the reluctant vampire by focusing

              | on the depiction of moral ambiguity. Abbott argues that, while previous
              | vampires walk a fine line between good and evil, Spike inhabits a far more
              | fractured self that overreaches this binary opposition. Through an analysis
              | of the narrative structure and mise-en-scène of the final series of Buffy the
              | Vampire Slayer, Abbott demonstrates that Spike undergoes the most
              | dramatic character development of any of the characters in the show, and
              | that this is effected through the presentation of multiple Spikes, a self that
              | is looking for unity, but that has been exponentially fragmented. Noting
              | Spike’s move from being ‘bad’, to being ‘chipped’ (an implant which pre-
              | vents him from harming humans), to being ‘mad’, to being ensouled,
              | Abbott examines in detail the manner in which Spike’s multiplicity is
              | overtly addressed within the narrative and dialogue of the show. She
              | relates this to the deconstruction of Spike’s leather-clad bad-boy biker
              | image in Season 7, each of Spike’s multiple selves being depicted through
              | a different visual look. Abbott examines how these multiple selves operate
              | to push the narrative forward in the final season, arguing that it is only
              | Spike’s recognition and acceptance of his own fractured nature which
              | enables him to acquire the strength he needs to sacrifice himself in the
              | season finale. Only this way can Spike contribute to the show’s ultimate
              | lesson, which abjures the privileging of uniqueness (of himself or even the
              | Slayer) in favour of celebrating the power of collective action.
              | Hills and Williams’ piece shifts the discussion from one which
              | concentrates on the textual construction of, and the fannish engagements
              | with, the character Spike, to one which examines the relationship
              | between the character and the meanings attached to him by the actor who
              | plays him, James Marsters. Hills and Williams argue that Marsters’
              | impact on our understanding of his character is ‘situated’. By this they
              | mean that Marsters does have agency in terms of interpreting Spike (both
              | on-screen and off), but that this is tempered by his role in the hierarchy of
              | production (wracked as it is with internal struggles) in which he does not
              | have an entirely ‘free hand’ in the performance of his star persona. Hills
              | and Williams consider Marsters to be a ‘subcultural celebrity’, by which
              | they mean a celebrity specific to the audience and fandom surrounding
              | Buffy the Vampire Slayer, rather than by general star recognition. There is
              | an overlapping between Marsters and Spike in a number of secondary
              | texts that circulate around the show, which Hills and Williams consider
              | not only to merge actor and character, but which also make Marsters
              | appear ‘fan-like’; they suggest that this disrupts the distance between ‘fan’
              | and ‘celebrity’. Key to this intervention is Marsters’ self-styled acces-
              | sibility to his fans. His positive encounters with fans having been
              | perfected, he manages to perform simultaneously the role of accessible
              | nice guy and enigmatic persona. In addition, rather than seeing celebrity
              | as only a product of institutional forces, Hills and Williams suggest that
              | Marsters’ celebrity indicates a need to examine more closely the way in
              | which actors participate in industry forms of promotion.

              | 2004, and combines ethnographic analysis with reflection on the
              | fan–scholar divide that has been the subject of much academic attention
              | (for example, Burt, 1998; Doty, 2000; Frith, 1990; Hills, 2002; Jenkins,
              | 1992; Michael, 2000). In his own reflections on the conference, one of the
              | organizers, David Lavery (2004), talks about almost 400 Buffy scholar-fans
              | and fan-scholars ‘having the time of their lives talking about, dissecting,
              | and singing about a show they love beyond the possibility to describe’.
              | Lavery is responding to criticism by Levine and Schneider (2003) in
              | ‘Feeling for Buffy: The Girl Next Door’ that Buffy scholars are so in love
              | with the show that their scholarship is often unreflective, narrow and
              | mistaken.
              | Yet Burr calls into questions Lavery’s emotive response to Levine and
              | Schnieder’s criticism noting that she, and several other conference atten-
              | dees who responded to her enquiries, felt stirrings of unease when it was
              | mentioned that thought had been given to inviting a member of Buffy’s
              | cast to the conference. Moreover, she notes that sessions did, on occasion,
              | veer away from academic analysis into heated discussion on topics that did
              | not seem to fit into a scholarly environment. She notes, in particular that
              | emotions ran high on the subject of Spike – and that any scholar
              | presenting a paper that sought to criticize the character was met with
              | considerable hostility. This, of course, is to show precisely that lack of
              | critical distance for which Levine and Schneider so roundly condemn
              | Buffy studies.
              | Burr does not attempt to address the reasons why Spike is such a site of
              | contention among fan-scholars and scholar-fans and we were intrigued,
              | although not surprised, that this was the case. Rather, it confirmed to us
              | that there was indeed something about Spike that resonated with fans and
              | scholars of the show in a way not found in the other supporting characters,
              | and that this warranted an in-depth analysis.
              | As far as we are aware, despite the huge volume of Buffy and Angel
              | scholarship available in print and on the internet, this is the first time a
              | single, supporting character of the shows has been the focus of an
              | academic endeavour. We hope that the articles in this issue convince the
              | reader that Spike is worth both the accolade and the effort.

              | The special issue editors would like to thank all those connected with the
              | European Journal of Cultural Studies for offering us the opportunity to turn our
              | idea for a journal issue on Spike into reality. In particular we would like to express
              | our gratitude to Joke Hermes for her advice, guidance and enthusiasm for this
              | endeavour. Thanks must also go to all our contributors, and to our colleagues and
              | families whose support has been invaluable. Copyright restrictions mean that we
              | are unable to include images of Spike in this edition; readers unfamiliar with the
              | character who would like a sense of his physical appearance are advised to visit

              | 2. Buffy the Vampire Slayer has become renowned among both fans and
              | scholars for its creative use of language and the creation of ‘Buffyspeak’. A
              | Buffy lexicon has been published by Oxford University Press (Adams,
              | 2004), and Adams will be editing the first special issue of the online journal
              | Slayage on ‘Beyond Slayer Slang: Pragmatics, Discourse and Style in Buffy
              | the Vampire Slayer’ (forthcoming).
              | 3. For an analysis of the ideological implications of Angel’s curse see Amy-
              | Chinn (2003).
              | 4. Throughout this special issue, episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer will be
              | referenced by title with the season and episode given in brackets
              | afterwards. Episodes of the spin-off show Angel will follow the same format
              | but will be prefixed with an A. Episodes are referenced in each article, but
              | only the first time that they are cited.
              | 5. ‘Siring’ is the ‘Buffyverse’ term for the process by which a human becomes
              | a vampire and involves, in keeping with vampire mythology, the exchange
              | of blood between two parties.
              | 6. In the DVD commentary to this episode the writers (David Fury and Drew
              | Goddard) reveal that they gave Spike’s mother the name ‘Anne’. They say
              | they chose this as it is Buffy’s middle name, but we might note that it is
              | also Rice’s first name.
