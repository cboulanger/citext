              | European integration has raised hopes and concerns about
              | its effect on the distribution of power among different actors,
              | and in particular on the role of the civil society. Focusing on
              | the Europeanization of public discourse in Italy as a case
              | study, this article addresses the speciﬁc problem of the
              | formation of supranational public spheres. On the basis of
              | content analyses of daily press and interviews, we argue that
              | various forms of Europeanization of the public discourse are
              | indeed on the rise, with a growing presence not only of
              | purely European actors but also of European targets and
              | frames. Europeanization appears to have been traditionally
              | a ‘top-down’ process: in fact the more Europeanized is a
              | policy, actor, target or issue scope, the less civil society
              | actors seem to have access to the public sphere. However,
              | some changes across time emerge, with the development
              | of (conﬂictual) forms of ‘Europeanization from below’.

              | The Europeanization of public discourse: An introduction
              | The growing competences of the European Union (EU) challenge parties,
              | interest groups, and social movement organizations that have mainly
              | developed at the national level. The European integration processes created
              | hopes and fears concerning the distribution of resources and power between
              | collective actors (Bartolini, 2002). Many studies have addressed the capacity
              | of the traditional actors of representative democracies to adapt to, or even to
              | take advantage of, European integration, focusing especially on their ability
              | to organize and act at the European level (for the most recent contributions
              | see Gabel and Hix, 2004; Steenbergen and Scott, 2004; Thomassen et al., 2004;
              | Wessels, 2004).
              | In this article, we want to address the issue of the impact of Europeaniza-
              | tion on national actors by focusing on their public discourse on European
              | issues. We consider the public discourse on Europe as a relevant issue in
              | normative as well as empirical terms. The accountability problem of inter-
              | national governmental organizations (IGOs) has usually been analysed in
              | terms of a lack (or a weakness, in the case of the EU) of those traditional
              | mechanisms of control developed in representative democracies: the ‘demo-
              | cratic deﬁcit’ has indeed been mainly discussed in terms of the absence (or
              | limited competences) of elected bodies. Democracies, however, require not
              | only electoral bodies but also open arenas where public decisions are subject
              | to the ‘proof of discussion’ (Manin, 1995). In democratic deliberation, issues
              | referring to the public good are debated in public spheres of different types,
              | including the mass media (Habermas, 1981, 1991): free and equal individuals
              | hold governors accountable by engaging in discussions based on reason and
              | the public good.
              | A central problem connected to the shift of power to supranational
              | institutions is the difﬁculty of subjecting their decisions to the ‘proof of
              | discussion’. Some analyses have in fact linked the weak legitimacy of
              | European institutions to the weakness of the European public sphere as a
              | precondition for deliberative legitimization as well as representative account-
              | ability. The Europeanization of the public sphere has usually been considered
              | a delicate issue, in terms of both the ﬂimsiness of the process (Gerhards, 1993)
              | and the lack of research on the topic (Le Torrec et al., 2001). Exploring this
              | issue further, a number of characteristics of EU politics have been held respon-
              | sible for the absence of a truly European public sphere: the democratic deﬁcit
              | linked to the limited powers of the European Parliament; the secretive
              | working methods of the European Commission; and the intergovernmental
              | nature of the European Council. Characteristics of the EU’s media system
              | have also been mentioned when explaining the low level of Europeanization
              | Della Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy
              | 7 9
              | in political communication, for instance the tendency of journalists to use
              | traditional categories rather than describing the novel aspects of the European
              | enterprise; the lack of a common language and a uniﬁed public; the preva-
              | lence of national agendas even in relation to purely EU news; and the preva-
              | lence of intergovernmental and elite-driven images of the EU (the European
              | Commission, for example, appearing far more frequently than the Parliament)
              | (Gerhards, 1993; Le Torrec et al., 2001).
              | The (largely pessimistic) body of research on the European public sphere
              | mainly compares the latter with the forms and institutions of national public
              | spheres, and assesses the difﬁculties encountered in the emerging European
              | mass media, political parties, etc. In our work, we do not exclude the possi-
              | bility of the formation of genuine, supranational European public spheres,
              | yet we do speculate about the presence of different paths towards the Euro-
              | peanization of a speciﬁc element related to the debate on the public sphere –
              | public discourse, deﬁned as ‘the “texts” emanating from the interaction of
              | people in public debate’ (Van de Steeg, 2002: 502), focusing our attention on
              | media texts.
              | We use the concept of Europeanization to refer not only to ‘the emer-
              | gence and development at the European level of distinct structures of govern-
              | ance’ (Risse et al., 2001: 3) but also to the impacts of these structures at the
              | domestic level in inﬂuencing the ways in which collective actors make their
              | demands visible in public discourses. In this sense, we address the ‘pro-
              | cessual’ aspects of Europeanization (Fabbrini, 2003) by analysing the recipro-
              | cal inﬂuences activated between the European and national structures – what
              | Radaelli and Franchino have recently deﬁned as ‘bottom-up Europeanisation’
              | – to indicate a research design that is pitched at the level of domestic politics
              | and policy (national or local): it starts from ‘an analysis of the system of inter-
              | action (actors, resources, problems, style, and collective problem-solving
              | rules) at the domestic level’, and raises the question of ‘whether the EU affects
              | this system of interaction and if so in what way (as a resource, as a reformu-
              | lation of the problem, as a new set of collective problem-solving rules, as a
              | constraint on what is feasible, as an alteration to the opportunity structure,
              | as a new frame of reference, etc.)’ (Radaelli and Franchino, 2004: 948). We also
              | focus on domestic actors, looking at the ways in which European institutions
              | and European issues are discussed in public discourse.
              | In particular, an analysis of public discourse allows us to address ‘soft
              | pressures’ on European integration, expressed through the alteration of the
              | beliefs and expectations of national actors (Knill and Lehmkuhl, 1999). The
              | way in which Europe is framed by different actors, together with the role of
              | discourses and ideas, public debates, and political communication on Europe,
              | is in fact gaining attention in social science research on Europeanization. If
              | 8 0
              | European Union Politics 7(1)
              | traditional theories that see European integration as driven by national
              | economic interests provided little space for the role of national debates on
              | European issues, the emergence of constructivist theories in international
              | relations, as well as institutional analyses of Europeanization, has led to
              | increasing attention being paid to the ways in which national actors perceive
              | and deﬁne the process of Europeanization. Since the mid-1990s, there has
              | been a social constructivist turn in research on Europeanization, a turn
              | developed in order to study the impact of ideas and other socially constructed
              | elements on several policy areas (Quaglia, 2004: 1097). In particular, Euro-
              | peanization proceeds through the work of norms entrepreneurs that adopt
              | and adapt European frames (see, for instance, Börzel and Risse, 2000), and
              | Europeanization has an impact on the political discourses and ideas through
              | which national actors deﬁne and justify their choices: ‘Not only can Europe
              | affect formal structures, it can also inﬂuence the values, norms and discourse
              | prevalent in member states. In turn, cognitive transformation may change the
              | preferences of policy-makers and therefore feedback into the process of
              | European integration’ (Radaelli, 2000: 2; see also Schmidt and Radaelli, 2004:
              | 184). We will indeed analyse how Europe is framed in the public discourse.
              | In this sense, Europeanization is measured not only by the active presence
              | of European actors but also by domestic actors’ references to European insti-
              | tutions and issues. If Europeanization produces multi-level governance, then
              | collective actions should adapt to intervening in and inﬂuencing the multiple
              | territorial layers of governance. As we shall see, domestic collective actors do
              | in fact seem to have adapted their action strategies so as not only to commu-
              | nicate with the various territorial levels of government but also to develop
              | strategies of ‘crossed inﬂuence’. That is, they attempt to apply pressure at the
              | national level in order to change decisions at the European level, or conversely
              | to apply pressure at the European level in order to change national decisions.
              | A typology of the different forms of Europeanization of the public discourse
              | can be built by combining the territorial scope of the claimant with that of
              | the target. In a fully supranational polity, all important claims would be made
              | by European political parties, interest groups, social movements and other
              | collective actors targeting the European institutions, or, as Imig and Tarrow
              | (2001b: 16) put it, ‘with functional interests mobilised through European
              | lobbies, territorial representatives organised in the EU Parliament, and state
              | interests represented in the European Council’. National public discourses
              | may, however, themselves Europeanize. This may, for instance, occur when
              | European actors exercise transnational pressure by intervening in national
              | public discourses, criticizing national policies or propagating European
              | integration. A third path to the Europeanization of the public discourse is
              | domestication, where debate over EU decisions takes place at the national level
              | Della Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy
              | 8 1
              | (Imig and Tarrow, 2001a). Domesticated claims are examples of claims-
              | making in which the EU or its policies are either the source or the indirect
              | target of claims by domestic actors, but where the direct target remains the
              | nation-state. In their analysis of protest in Europe, Imig and Tarrow (2001a)
              | stressed that most of the EU-related events that they singled out (406 out of
              | 490) were cases of domestication, with an increase in all protest events from
              | about 5% in 1992 to 10% in 1997. Such mobilizations may be considered as
              | proof of the dominant position of the nation-state. However, a more careful
              | look shows the emergence, in the course of these campaigns, of innovations
              | both in the organizational structure and in the frames of the protests (della
              | Porta 2003a, 2003b). Finally, a form of externalization is present if and when
              | the mobilizations and communications of national actors target the EU
              | directly: this often takes place in an attempt to put pressure on the groups’
              | own governments (Chabanet, 2002).
              | Where the degree of Europeanization of public discourse proves to be
              | more relevant than expected, an important question is: who in the discursive
              | arena gains from this shift in the territorial level of debate? Amongst those
              | who stress the relevance of the process of European integration for national
              | collective action, positions diverge on its effects in terms of the empowerment
              | of different actors and coalitions. Some scholars expect that civil society
              | actors, owing amongst other qualities to the ﬂexibility of their organizational
              | structures, will be able to adapt quickly to these changes (the increasingly
              | mentioned concept of ‘global civil society’ testifying to this expectation).
              | Others, however, are sceptical – not only that actors endowed with scarce
              | material resources will be able to invest in transnational organization-
              | building and the staging of supranational protest events, but also that they
              | can inﬂuence European politics ‘from below’ (della Porta and Tarrow, 2004).
              | European integration has had the predictable effect of multiplying both
              | restrictions and opportunities for various actors. Indeed, the construction of
              | community institutions, as well as the policies developed by the EU, is
              | increasingly the object of lively criticisms by loose networks of local, national
              | and transnational actors. As Hooghe and Marks (1995), among others, have
              | predicted, European integration no longer takes place under technocratic
              | cover; there is, instead, an explicit and continuous political conﬂict between
              | coalitions of governments, supranational bodies and national interests.
              | In particular, this article investigates the degree and forms of partici-
              | pation of various actors (institutional and non-institutional) in the Euro-
              | peanization of public discourse – that is, their capacity to take part in the
              | debates and mobilizations referring to European issues, targets and actors.
              | We will also focus on the evaluation of the process of European integration
              | by institutional actors, political parties, interest groups and social movement
              | 8 2
              | European Union Politics 7(1)
              | organizations, demonstrating that (different types of) actors are not merely
              | adapting to the transforming political context but also bearing speciﬁc visions
              | of ‘what’ Europe is and should be. In fact, qualitative information from inter-
              | views with representatives of several collective actors in Italy will indicate
              | that support (or criticism) of European integration can be presented within
              | extremely varied conceptions of Europe, which emerges in fact as an
              | ‘imagined community’ that means very different things to different collective
              | actors (della Porta and Caiani, 2005).
              | In what follows we shall describe the signiﬁcant and growing degree of
              | Europeanization apparent in Italian public discourse (see also Trenz and Eder
              | 2004), albeit with a low presence of civil society actors. Our data indicate that,
              | the more Europeanized a policy, actor, target or issue, the less civil society
              | actors seem to have access to public discourse (at least in the mainstream
              | media). However, we observe some changes across time that display a slowly
              | emerging Europeanization from below. We shall, moreover, discuss the more
              | conﬂictual attitudes of some civil society actors toward Europeanization.
              | The Europeanization of public discourse: A research project
              | The ﬁrst aim of this article is to assess and compare the degree and forms of
              | the Europeanization of public discourse. Thus, we investigate the extent to
              | which collective actors operating within (national) Italian public discourse are
              | carriers of Europeanization, by either organizing at the European level,
              | making demands on European institutions, or framing their demands within
              | European frameworks. Mainly using printed media as a data source, we
              | analyse the general features of political claims-making by various types of
              | actors, contrasting institutional and non-institutional actors – the latter often
              | being indicated by the (widely understood) category of ‘civil society actors’.
              | Focusing on the part of the public discourse represented in the printed
              | media does not imply that this is considered to be the only arena in which
              | claims are presented. In particular, some actors are less dependent upon the
              | mass media because they enjoy direct access to decision-makers; others are
              | less able to inﬂuence the mass media and therefore need to resort to alterna-
              | tive communication channels. Some may choose to address public opinion
              | because their claims resonate with the majority public opinion; others may
              | opt for less visible channels because they have more support among the elite
              | than in the wider population. However, we assume that the printed media
              | are one of the most important arenas of public claims-making, and that most
              | actors will, at one stage or another, use them in order to make their views
              | public.
              | Della Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy
              | 8 3
              | We shall analyse the presence of different types of Europeanization in
              | Italy, in a cross-time (1990, 1995, 2000, 2002) and cross-issue perspective (in
              | particular, besides the issue of European integration itself, we focus on six
              | substantive policy ﬁelds, chosen strategically in that they present varying
              | degrees of EU policy-making power). Our main assumption is indeed that
              | the degree and forms of Europeanization of the public discourse of different
              | actors will be inﬂuenced primarily by the political opportunities available for
              | them – i.e. by the set of opportunities and constraints that are offered by the
              | institutional structure and political culture of the political system in which
              | they operate (see e.g. Tarrow, 1994). In a system of multi-level governance,
              | we hypothesize a higher proportion of references to the European political
              | institutions and discourses in those policy ﬁelds, such as agriculture and
              | monetary policies, that fall under the ﬁrst pillar, where EU competences are
              | strongest; an intermediate level of Europeanization in policy areas such as
              | migration and defence, which, although based on national decision-making,
              | are discussed in intergovernmental forums (such as the Council of Ministers);
              | and the least Europeanization on education and pension policies, which are
              | affected by EU institutions through the less intrusive instrument of the Open
              | Method of Coordination. Likewise, we hypothesize a growth of references to
              | the European political institutions and discourses over time as the European
              | integration process has deepened over the past 15 years.
              | Nevertheless, since the capacity to refer to the EU level is also related to
              | the characteristics of actors, including their material and symbolic resources,
              | we also expect important differences among collective actors within policy
              | areas. The process of European integration being mainly carried out by
              | government representatives and strengthening executive power at the
              | national level (Moravcsik, 1994), we also hypothesize a larger presence of
              | institutional actors in Europeanized debate. However, as the neo-functional
              | approach to European integration has suggested, growing European com-
              | petences tend to spill over into growing contention on European issues. We
              | therefore also hypothesize that strategically oriented actors will increasingly
              | address territorial levels with growing competences. Taking into account
              | symbolic resources as well, we expect that targeting the EU level will help to
              | spread supranational frames and identities, legitimizing European insti-
              | tutions even by contesting them.
              | Although the larger project of which this article is part includes seven
              | European countries, here we will draw only on data for the Italian case,
              | although we often compare these with the general trends in claims-making
              | that has emerged in the other European countries in order to underline simi-
              | larities and differences (based upon data available on the Europub.com
              | website).1 In general, Italy has been considered to be a particularly Europhile
              | 8 4
              | European Union Politics 7(1)
              | country, with citizens (as in other southern European countries) holding low
              | opinions of their national elites and being more conﬁdent instead in the func-
              | tioning of European institutions (Sánchez-Cuenca, 2000). Faced with corrup-
              | tion and inefﬁcient public administration, public opinion as well as political
              | elites support European integration, which is perceived as an opportunity to
              | ‘normalize’ the many Italian pathologies (Giuliani, 2000; Ferrera, 2003: 243).
              | In opinion polls, Italian scores on net support for membership in the European
              | Union were in line with the European average of 49% in 2000; this was well
              | below not only Luxembourg (75%) and Ireland (71%), but also the Nether-
              | lands (64%), Belgium and other southern European countries (all above 50%);
              | however, it was above West Germany (36%), Denmark (29%), the UK (5%)
              | and Sweden (1%) (Diez Medrano, 2003: 10). Generous allocations of cohesion
              | funds may have increased the traditional support for Europe that made Italy
              | one of the founding fathers of the ﬁrst European institutions. A southern
              | European (less developed) welfare state has been cited as explaining high
              | individual support for European integration (Sánchez-Cuenca, 2000; Brinegar
              | and Jolly, 2005).
              | Bipartisan consensus on Europe was, however, challenged when the
              | corruption scandals of the early 1990s ended in the disappearance of the
              | Christian Democratic party and the emergence of the centre-right parties Lega
              | Nord and Forza Italia, both of which are much less supportive of the
              | European project. Qualitative research on the ‘framing of Europe’ yields
              | frequent references to the beneﬁts of common membership in terms of well-
              | being and economic growth, as well as a belief in the advantages of joining
              | forces with several small states, but also fears that the EU is opaque, distant,
              | unaccountable and inefﬁcient (Diez Medrano, 2003: Ch. 2). The enlargement
              | of the European Union on its eastern borders, as well as the introduction of
              | the euro and the austerity policy imposed in order to meet the Maastricht
              | criteria for entering the European Monetary Union, have however contributed
              | to breaking the permissive consensus around European integration. Most of
              | the trends that we shall mention in this article are shared across nations, and
              | the Italian case can be taken as an illustration of more general dynamics.
              | For the empirical data collection we use the methodology of political
              | claim analysis (see Koopmans and Statham, 1999, 2002), a quantitative
              | method that takes individual political claims as units of analysis and uses
              | newspapers as a source for the publicly visible part of this claims-making. A
              | claim is deﬁned as an instance of strategic action in the mass media. It consists
              | of the expression of a political opinion by physical or verbal action, regard-
              | less of the form this expression takes (statement, institutional decision, court
              | ruling, protest, etc.), and regardless of the nature of the actor (media, govern-
              | ments, civil society actors, etc.). The claim analysis approach aims to integrate
              | Della Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy
              | 8 5
              | two methodological traditions of social movement research: (quantitative)
              | protest event analysis (Tarrow, 1989; Franzosi, 1994) and (qualitative) frame
              | analysis (Snow et al., 1986; Gamson and Modigliani, 1989). By systematically
              | coding discursive dimensions, claim analysis broadens the scope of attention
              | from protest to all forms of claims-making in the public domain, including
              | conventional and verbal actions. Moreover, it locates social movement
              | organizations within a larger multi-organizational ﬁeld by including insti-
              | tutional and non-institutional actors. The main actors of claim analysis are no
              | longer ‘protesters’ but claimants, namely the subjects of a strategic action
              | (whether verbal or not) in the mass-mediated public discourse. Although the
              | use of the daily press as a source of information on protest or public discourse
              | has been criticized on the basis of the selection biases introduced by the rules
              | of journalistic coverage, in our research this risk is limited since we are inter-
              | ested speciﬁcally in public claims-making. Further, in order to reduce the
              | description bias (McCarthy et al., 1996), besides focusing on quality news-
              | papers (which have to protect their reputation), we based our coding only on
              | the factual coverage of events.
              | An act of claims-making can normally be broken down into the elements
              | shown in Figure 1: subject actor, form, addressee, issue, object actor and frame
              | (Koopmans and Erbe, 2002). In order to analyse degrees of Europeanization,
              | we coded the polity/territorial scope at which each actor, addressee, object
              | and frame are organized – distinguishing between local, regional, national,
              | transnational (multilateral/bilateral), European and supranational (e.g. UN)
              | actors.
              | Although our data set shows the claims-making of detailed categories of
              | actors (e.g. Italian unions, the Italian green party, etc.), our analysis in this
              | article will focus on the characteristics of the claims-making of general
              | categories of actors. Simplifying somewhat, we shall compare institutional
              | actors (government/executive, judiciary, police and internal security
              | agencies, military, central banks and other state executive agencies) with non-
              | institutional actors (which we shall refer to under the broad category of civil
              | society), including media and journalists, economic interest groups

              | (composed of employers’ organizations and ﬁrms, farmers and agricultural
              | organizations, economists and ﬁnancial experts and other professional
              | organizations and groups) and social movement organizations (composed of
              | unions and students’, peace, women’s, immigrants’, environmental,
              | consumer, welfare organizations, etc.). Unions have been included in the
              | category of social movements because ﬁrst analyses showed that on several
              | dimensions they had the same trends and characteristics as other social
              | movement organizations. Farmers and agricultural organizations, however,
              | display patterns similar to those of other economic interest groups. When
              | members of political parties spoke as representatives of public bodies (parlia-
              | ments, governments, etc.), we counted them as institutional actors; when they
              | did not play this role, we included them in a subcategory of non-institutional
              | actors, thereby respecting the formal characteristics of parties as voluntary
              | associations (even if close to the state). Owing to the small number of claims
              | made by members of parties that do not speak as representatives of public
              | institutions, this choice does not affect the result of our analysis; moreover,
              | in the article we will often analyse trends for speciﬁc categories of actors, thus
              | indicating if speciﬁc trends for parties will emerge.
              | Our data were gathered from the news coverage of two quality national
              | newspapers that differ in political afﬁliation: La Repubblica (left oriented) and
              | Il Corriere della Sera (centre oriented). We coded the years 1990, 1995, 2000 and
              | 2002. Articles relating to our six policy domains plus the topic of European
              | integration were collected from two issues per week for 2000 and 2002, and
              | from one issue per week for 1990 and 1995. For 2000, we also included two
              | regional newspapers (La Nazione and Il Mattino), of which one issue was coded
              | per week. The greater part of the database (90%) is constituted by articles from
              | the two quality dailies. Culture and sports sections, letters to the editor and
              | supplements were excluded from the coding; articles in the regional and local
              | sections (where present) were included only if referred to in the inter-
              | national/national news section of the paper. Data were coded on the basis of
              | a standardized codebook (Koopmans, 2002). All articles in the news section
              | and in the economic and business section of the newspapers were checked for
              | relevant acts. Inter-coder reliability tests were undertaken on both the selec-
              | tion of articles and the coding and, in addition, coders participated in regular
              | online discussions about difﬁcult cases.2 In Italy, for 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2002,
              | 1331 articles were coded for a total of 3541 claims. Among these, 957 claims
              | were selected for a reduced sample that included only articles with a European
              | dimension in either the claimant, the addressee, the issue or the object. The
              | remaining 2584 claims were selected from a full sample (all articles).3
              | In the last section of the article, we refer to yet another part of the
              | research in which, between July 2003 and April 2004, we conducted around

              | 8 7
              | 60 semi-structured interviews with representatives of the Italian organizations
              | that emerged as most important from the claim analysis in the ﬁelds of
              | European integration, agriculture and immigration. Interview partners were
              | selected according to two criteria. First, we referred to the results of the politi-
              | cal claim analysis (the frequency of appearance) concerning these three issue
              | ﬁelds. Then we integrated the lists of the most inﬂuential actors in the debate
              | with our knowledge of the core actors active in the policy domain under
              | study; we also consulted academic experts in each ﬁeld for additional sugges-
              | tions. The semi-structured questionnaire focused on changes in the communi-
              | cation and mobilization strategies of collective actors related to the process
              | of European integration. Concerning the interview sample, in each of the three
              | policy ﬁelds, ﬁve interview partners were identiﬁed from four categories of
              | collective actor (government/administration, political parties, economic
              | interest groups and social movement groups), to make a total of 20 inter-
              | viewees in each policy ﬁeld. Further details on the sampling of our interview
              | partners and the questionnaire used are available on the project website (for
              | a qualitative and detailed analysis of the interviews, see della Porta, 2004;
              | della Porta and Caiani, 2004, 2005).
              | The dominant Europeanization: From above
              | An important criterion for the analysis of the public debates and actions
              | concerning Europe is the extent to which different types of collective actor
              | participate in them. Which actors are the carriers of the Europeanization of
              | public discourse? Are they institutional actors, pushing Europeanization from
              | above, or civil society actors, bringing about a Europeanization from below?
              | Both the realist and functionalist standpoints perceive European development
              | as an elite-driven, top-down process. Institutional actors, at all territorial
              | levels, have been seen as the driving force behind policy-making (see Imig
              | and Tarrow, 2001a). Important studies in the ﬁeld emphasize institution-
              | building as a formal process involving formal actors. However, much research
              | on the formation of nation-states reveals that, over and above constitutional
              | input ‘from above’, the construction of these territorial entities involved the
              | development of a common identity through participation ‘from below’.
              | Moreover, the development of a ‘European citizenship’ is a topic of increas-
              | ing interest to both scholars and policy-makers.
              | By looking at the Europeanization of public discourse by policy domain,
              | we can test the hypothesis that discursive references to the EU increase with
              | EU competences. The hypothesis that Europeanization is facilitated by the
              | availability of organizational resources is instead tested by comparing

              | 8 9
              | institutional and non-institutional actors. When looking at which types of
              | actors make claims in public discourse according to the seven policy domains
              | covered in our research (see Table 1), we notice a decline in the presence of
              | civil society actors in those ﬁelds in which the European Union has more formal
              | competences. In the ﬁelds of monetary policy and European integration, insti-
              | tutional actors monopolize the debate and civil society has a very low presence,
              | with the partial exception of economic interest groups and parties. The range
              | of actors involved in education and pension policies is more differentiated,
              | with a signiﬁcant presence of civil society organizations. Nevertheless, the
              | correlation between the degree of institutionalization of EU competences and
              | a weak presence of civil society does not hold for troop deployment (low EU
              | competence combined with a low presence of civil society actors) and agricul-
              | ture (relevant EU competences but a signiﬁcant presence of civil society actors).
              | In the debate on education, civil society actors are mainly constituted by non-
              | governmental organizations (NGOs) and social movements, whereas in the
              | debate on pensions the range of civil society actors is more evenly distributed
              | between parties, economic interest groups and social movements. In terms of
              | Europeanization, the data indicate that, in the Italian public discourse, issues
              | of European integration as well as those concerning monetary policy and troop
              | deployment are strongly debated within the institutional arena, whereas
              | discussions on pensions and education, but also the already Europeanized
              | domain of agriculture, are more pluralistic, involving a wider range of actors.
              | When looking at claim-makers, it is worth noting that, among European
              | and supranational/transnational actors, institutional actors account for the
              | vast proportion (88–94%). We ﬁnd very few civil society actors organized at
              | the EU level (6%) and, where present, they more often represent institution-
              | alized economic interest groups than public interest associations and NGOs.
              | Surprisingly, non-EU supranational civil society actors, as well as forms of
              | transnational linkages among civil society actors through multilateral
              | contacts, are more present (12%) than EU civil society actors. These ﬁndings
              | indicate the constraints on the emergence of a transnational civil society that
              | could stimulate European integration from below, or at least high thresholds
              | for such organizations to appear in the public domain.
              | However, looking at the presence of European actors as claim-makers is
              | only one way to investigate the Europeanization of public discourse. Another
              | indicator of Europeanization, although of a different type, is the choice of
              | European institutions as the targets of collective demands. Table 2 shows that,
              | overall, although national (and subnational) actors are still the main focus of
              | collective mobilization and debate (58.3%), European actors and institutions
              | nevertheless have a role to play (17.9%). Even actors from other EU member
              | states have some role as addressees of claims-making, whereas supranational

              | and transnational (bilateral/multilateral) actors are rarely present. However,
              | what is most striking in the comparison between types of actor is that civil
              | society actors are signiﬁcantly less likely to address their political demands
              | to European and supranational institutions than are institutional actors. The
              | exceptions here are economic interest groups and the media, which frequently
              | direct their claims to European addressees; parties show similar tendencies
              | to social movements.
              | A cross-policy comparison of the scope of the targets of different types
              | of actor points to important differences. There is a strong presence of
              | European addressees for both institutional and civil society actors on issues
              | concerning European integration, monetary policy and agriculture. In
              | contrast, little attention is paid to the EU as a target of claims-making on
              | issues of immigration and even less so on issues concerning education and
              | pensions. A fairly similar picture of low European targeting emerges in the
              | policy ﬁeld of troop deployment, although here civil society actors address
              | their claims to European actors much more often than institutional actors do.
              | Another important indicator of the Europeanization of public discourse
              | is the scope of the issues that are mobilized by claims. Issue scope refers to
              | the geographical and/or political scope of the substantive content of the
              | claim. The issue scope is in principle independent from the scope of the
              | subject actor, target and/or object, referring instead to the framing of a
              | demand. For instance, if Amnesty International appeals to the European
              | Court of Justice in order to protest against the Milanese regulation that privi-
              | leges Lombards whilst discriminating against immigrants, the actor is supra-
              | national, the addressee is European, but the scope of the issue remains local.
              | However, if a local Milanese committee, acting in defence of migrants, criti-
              | cizes the Milanese city council for their migration policy on the grounds that
              | it constitutes a breach of the international conventions on human rights, then
              | the issue scope is supranational, in spite of the local scope of the actor and
              | addressee. This indicator allows us to investigate the ‘salience’ of the integra-
              | tion process in the everyday life of citizens: the question is whether the nation-
              | state remains the primary focus for debates, discourses and the formation of
              | collective identities, or whether, on the contrary, actors increasingly frame
              | their claims within a European dimension. In order to avoid overestimating
              | claims with a European dimension, in Table 3 and the following analyses
              | related (cross-time and cross-issue), claims in the ﬁeld of European integra-
              | tion are not included, since their scope is by deﬁnition European.
              | In claims made by institutional actors, issues are often framed with
              | speciﬁc reference to Europe, whereas in claims made by non-institutional
              | actors national references remain more important (see Table 3). However, the

              | Della Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy
              | 9 3
              | public discourse are slightly less evident than for the other previously
              | mentioned indicators. Amongst non-institutional actors, reference to the
              | European Union is very limited in instances of social movements’ claims-
              | making but is much more present in the claims of economic interest groups
              | and the media.
              | Yet here, too, there are signiﬁcant differences between the issue ﬁelds.
              | Monetary policy and agriculture are often framed with speciﬁc reference to
              | Europe (64.0% of claims with a European issue scope made by institutional
              | actors, and 56.8% of those made by non-institutional actors for monetary
              | policy, and 44.2% and 30.6%, respectively, for agriculture). In immigration,
              | troop deployment, pensions and education, however, claims referring to the
              | European Union are present at only a very low degree, especially in the claims
              | made by non-institutional actors (4–9% institutional actors, 2–3% non-insti-
              | tutional). Unsurprisingly, for pensions and education – ﬁelds that remain
              | under the full control of national political institutions – public debate is almost
              | entirely concentrated within the Italian national space.4 Nevertheless, in these
              | ﬁelds, especially that of pensions, a small but signiﬁcant portion of claims (in
              | the range of 7–9% for both types of actor) refers to other EU members.
              | These results may be explained by the tradition of institutional, biparti-
              | san support for European integration, as well as the weak structure of civil
              | society actors, but the Europub.com research project conﬁrmed similar trends
              | in the other six countries covered (on the basis of as many as 20,000 political
              | claims collected from 28 newspapers). Across all countries, debates on
              | European integration (compared with those on the other issue ﬁelds) turn out
              | to be highly elitist. State and party actors dominate every issue ﬁeld, but
              | nowhere as strongly as in the debates on European integration, where 81%
              | of the speakers are state or party actors (70% in the seven-issue average).
              | Economic interest groups and other civil society groups are much less promi-
              | nent in debates on European integration than in the other issue ﬁelds – respec-
              | tively, 2% (against 10% on average for all seven issues) and 5% (against 11%
              | for the seven-issue average) (Koopmans, 2004: 45).
              | The slowly emerging Europeanization from below
              | The Europeanization of public discourse seems, at ﬁrst glance, to reduce the
              | opportunities for non-institutional actors: Europeanization appears to be
              | mainly imposed ‘from above’. This is no surprise. Research on protest events,
              | usually based on newspaper sources, stresses the scarcity of protests that
              | directly target European institutions. Using Reuters World News Service and
              | Reuters Textline, Imig and Tarrow (2001a) – the ﬁrst to analyse protest at the
              | 9 4
              | European Union Politics 7(1)
              | EU level – found a very limited number of such protests. Similarly, in
              | Germany, Rucht (2002) has observed a low (and declining) proportion of
              | protests aimed at the international level (the highest levels being reached in
              | 1960–4); he concludes that, ‘as far as Germany is concerned, the Europeaniza-
              | tion and, more in general, Europeanization of protest is a myth’ (Rucht, 2002:
              | 185). Meanwhile Giugni and Passy (2002) noted how rarely protests on
              | migrants’ rights target the EU, notwithstanding the increasing Europeaniza-
              | tion of decisions on migration, at least in terms of access quotas and border
              | controls. Even environmental action is very rarely aimed at Brussels: protests
              | with EU targets ranged from 0.8% in Italy to 4.6% in Germany in the past
              | decade, with no discernible increasing trend (Rootes, 2002).
              | Our data, however, point to a signiﬁcant and slowly growing adaptation
              | among non-institutional actors to the shift in competences and discourses to
              | the supranational level. In terms of targets and issue scope, the presence of
              | non-institutional actors has indeed been slowly increasing, although not in a
              | linear fashion, over the years in Italy (see Figure 2). In particular, whereas
              | claims with a national Italian issue scope have increased (although not in a
              | linear manner) for institutional actors (from 20.3% of claims in 1990 to 42.9%
              | in 1995 to 47.4% in 2000 to 35.7% in 2002), they have decreased for non-insti-
              | tutional actors (from 71.6% in 1990 to 79.5% in 1995 to 65.8% in 2000 to 64%
              | in 2002). Instead, it is the European level that has become more and more
              | prominent over the years, especially for non-institutional actors, who have
              | tripled these types of claim in more recent years (from 4.5% in 1990 to 17.3%
              | in 2000 and 15% in 2002, compared with institutional actors with 14.4% in
              | 1990, 15.4% in 1995, 23.1% in 2000 and 36.0% in 2002). Relatively little atten-
              | tion, decreasing across the years, is paid to other EU countries by both types
              | of actor. Claims with an issue scope referring to other EU members repre-
              | sented a share of 5.9% and 3.4% for institutional and non-institutional actors
              | in 1990, 7.1% and 4.1% in 1995, 3.8% and 2.5% in 2000, 0.3% and 2.5% in 2002.
              | More precisely, in claims-making referring to Europe, economic interest
              | groups, social movements and the media in particular have increased their
              | presence over the years (economic interest groups from 11.1% of all claims in
              | 1990, to 18.2% in 1995, 43.8% in 2000 and 42.4% in 2002; social movements
              | from about 3–4% of all claims in 1990, 1995 and 2000 to 12.0% in 2002; the
              | media from none in 1990, to 11.1% in 1995, 53.8% in 2000 and 15.4% in 2002).5
              | The proportion of claims addressed to EU targets also increased signiﬁ-
              | cantly between 1990 and 2002 for non-institutional actors, and at a higher
              | speed than for institutional actors. Whereas in 1990 and 1995 only the media,
              | parties and economic interest groups addressed their claims to European
              | institutions, from 2000 onwards even social movements began to address the
              | European level; at the same time, other non-institutional actors were also

              | increasingly targeting the EU (e.g. 5.6% of economic interest groups’ claims
              | had a European addressee in 1995, growing to about 25–28% in 2000 and
              | 2002).6
              | This growing ‘Europeanization from below’ does, however, follow a
              | peculiar pattern. Applying our typology of forms of Europeanization to our
              | data on claims-making in Italy (Table 4),7 we can see that, overall, the Euro-
              | peanization of public discourse mainly assumes the forms of domestication
              | (34.6%) and externalization (31.3%). Supranational dynamics are also relevant
              | (24.6%), but transnational pressure applies to only 9.5% of cases. However, a
              | comparison of institutional and non-institutional actors points to important
              | differences in the forms of Europeanization. Focusing on claims made by insti-
              | tutional actors, supranationalization and externalization are equally
              | dominant forms of Europeanization (representing 30.0% and 33.3%, respec-
              | tively); domestication is slightly less signiﬁcant (26.9%); and the intervention
              | of EU institutional actors targeting a member state is less frequent (12.5%), at
              | least in the ‘visible’ public discourse. If we focus instead on non-institutional
              | actors, we see that the prevailing type of Europeanization is domestication
              | (55.8%) but that externalization is also important (33.3%); the presence of
              | European social actors addressing either the EU (9.6%) or national govern-
              | ments (1.2%) is much less frequent, although not negligible. In more detail,
              | parties are most often characterized by forms of domestication in claims-
              | making with reference to Europe (70.0% of all claims), whereas Europeaniza-
              | tion via domestication covers about half of all claims among economic interest
              | groups, social movements and the media (46.5%, 53.4% and 42.4%, respec-
              | tively). Finally, economic interest groups and the media are the most involved
              | in forms of supranationalization of public discourse (about 15% of all claims).

              | As for the temporal trends in the types of Europeanization, domestica-
              | tion has remained nearly constant across the years, representing about one-
              | third of claims; externalization and supranationalization have increased
              | slightly in more recent years (34.5% and 28.0%, respectively, of cases in 2000
              | and 30.7% and 27.4% in 2002, compared with a share of about 20–25% each
              | in 1990 and 1995). Domestication is typical of farmers’ protests: the majority
              | of farmers’ protests studied between 1992 and 1997 were aimed at national
              | governments and occurred within domestic political spaces, even if they
              | concerned European issues (Bush and Simi, 2001: 102). Comparative research
              | on Spain and the Netherlands has illustrated that farmers have continued to
              | hold their national representatives responsible, even if these have insisted that
              | the causes of the farmers’ grievances were beyond their control (Klander-
              | mans, 2001). Cases of transnational pressure are stable at about 10%.
              | Distinguishing the diachronic trends for different types of actor, we can
              | see that for non-institutional actors domestication was more common in the
              | past than in more recent years (moving from about 80% of cases in the 1990s
              | to 45.6% in 2000 and 54.8% in 2002). Externalization slowly decreased for insti-
              | tutional actors between 1990 and 2002 (remaining at about 30%), whereas it
              | increased for non-institutional actors (from 10.0% in 1990 to 40.8% in 2000 to
              | 35.2% in 2002). Transnational pressure is virtually absent for non-institutional
              | actors across the years, and it has remained at a nearly constant level of about
              | Della Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy
              | 9 7
              | 12–13% for institutional actors. Finally, forms of supranationalism increased
              | for institutional actors (from 30.0% in 1990 to 37.0% in 2000 and 32.5% in 2002)
              | but not for civil society.
              | To conclude, non-institutional actors seem to have more difﬁculty in allo-
              | cating resources in order to build European organizational structures.
              | However, even if transnational civil society organizations are still rarely
              | present in the Europeanized public discourse, the tendency to address the EU
              | is not insigniﬁcant. The construction of community institutions, as well as the
              | policies chosen by the EU, is increasingly the object of vigorous responses by
              | loose networks of local, national and transnational actors.
              | Consensual Europeanization or conﬂictual
              | Europeanization?
              | Another relevant dimension to investigate is the degree of conﬂict in the
              | process of Europeanization. That is, if we ﬁnd claims concerning Europe, are
              | they supportive or critical of the European polity, politics and policies? The
              | development of territorial politics follows both consensual and conﬂictual
              | paths. The nation-state evolved through conﬂicts of greater or lesser degrees
              | of politicization between the centre and the periphery, between the church
              | and the state, with both cleavages contributing to shaping the characteristics
              | of national politics (Rokkan, 1982). The mobilization of other cleavages, in
              | particular social class divides, also contributed to the building of the nation-
              | state, and the struggle to construct a national polity interacted with the
              | production of national policies (Bendix, 1964). Conﬂicts can (and do) develop
              | around both the very existence of a European polity and the speciﬁc policies
              | implemented by European institutions. In this section, we shall investigate
              | some characteristics of consensual versus conﬂictual forms of Europeaniza-
              | tion, comparing institutional and non-institutional actors.
              | Many studies have indicated a decline in support for the EU in public
              | opinion, stressing the erosion of the ‘permissive consensus’ based on bureau-
              | cratic legitimacy (Eder, 2000: 179–80). Together with the growth of protest
              | targeting the EU (Imig, 2004), the decline of trust in European institutions is
              | an indicator of the weakening of EU legitimacy by ‘output’ legitimacy secured
              | by the efﬁcacy of policy outcomes, rather than legitimacy secured by repre-
              | sentative ‘input’ procedures (Scharpf, 1999).
              | Our data conﬁrm a growing dissatisfaction with the functioning of the
              | EU, but also tensions between different images of Europe, supporting the
              | hypothesis that growing competences bring about increasing contestation. In
              | Table 5 we show the distribution of conﬂictual claims by type of actor, in both
              | 9 8
              | European Union Politics 7(1)
              | domestic and ‘European’ claims-making.8 In the operationalization of
              | domestic claims, we consider only those with a national issue scope (N =
              | 1332). Overall, the extent of conﬂictual claims is lower in European (28.6%)
              | than in domestic claims-making (36.1%). Nevertheless, Europeanized conﬂict-
              | ual claims have increased, although not linearly, over the years (from 21.2%
              | of all EU-based claims in 1990 to 34.7% in 1995, 30.7% in 2000 and 27.1% in
              | 2002), whereas the proportion of conﬂictual claims in the domestic debate
              | remained nearly constant at about one-third of the sample.
              | We may add that civil society actors (in particular, social movements and
              | parties) are much more conﬂictual than institutional actors, even in claims-
              | making with reference to Europe. Conﬂictual politics may be more present
              | in national than in European politics, but the degree of conﬂict in claims-
              | making has increased across the years in Europeanized policy ﬁelds.
              | Contrary to the expectation that channels for including ‘civilized’ actors in
              | EU policy-making would tame civil society organizations (see, for instance,
              | Mazey and Richardson, 1993), non-institutional actors are more conﬂictual
              | than institutional actors even when addressing issues of EU scope, and they
              | do not appear to moderate their repertoire of action. Imig and Tarrow (2001a:
              | 43) also ﬁnd that, concerning repertoires of EU conﬂictual politics from 1984
              | to 1997, conﬂictual actions continued to represent a substantial share of
              | claims-making addressing the EU.
              | In order to delve more deeply into the attitudes of different types of actor,

              | we can look at our data on the position of claims-makers on the issue of
              | European integration. Are the claims against any deepening of the integra-
              | tion process, or do they imply an extension of the competences of European
              | institutions? Valence position scores on Europe/European integration range
              | in our coding from –1 (against a deepening of the integration process) to +1
              | (in favour of deepening integration and the extension of the rights and posi-
              | tions of European institutions and regulations; a 0 score indicates claims that
              | are neutral or ambivalent in this respect). In Figure 3, we show the score of
              | the average valence position on Europe for each collective actor, calculated
              | by aggregating the position scores of that actor’s claims.9 The overall debate
              | in Italy about Europe appears to be characterized by a positive attitude
              | toward Europeanization (+.24), conﬁrming other data about the pro-
              | European sentiments present in Italian public opinion (della Porta, 2003c:
              | 20–3). In a cross-national comparison with the Europub.com countries, Italy
              | ranks third in support for the process of European integration (after Germany
              | and France) and is followed by Spain, the Netherlands and the UK
              | (Koopmans, 2004: 45).
              | Institutional actors have more positive attitudes towards European inte-
              | gration, although their support for Europe is not characterized by a linear
              | trend over time. Civil society actors are in general less enthusiastic about the
              | European integration process, with an increase in support for Europe up to
              | 2000, followed by a sharp decrease. Among the non-institutional actors,
              | economic interest groups have a slightly more pro-European position, and
              | social movements and the media are more critical of European integration.
              | In public positions on Europe, then, integration seems to be a project more
              | dear to the political and economic elites than to civil society actors, who,

              | although not homogeneously, feel that they are on the losing side. In cross-
              | national comparison, support for the integration process is everywhere
              | stronger among institutional and party actors (+.26 across all seven countries)
              | than among various categories of non-institutional actors – economic interest
              | groups (+.12), the media (+.13) and other civil society groups (+.13). The
              | stronger socioeconomic actors (employers and business organizations) are, in
              | most countries, more supportive of the integration process (+.20) than are
              | trade unions (+.12). In Italy, unions emerge as particularly critical of the
              | process in comparison with the more general European trend (–.13;
              | Koopmans, 2004: 43).
              | However, the support of every type of actor declines after 2000. In Italy,
              | the cross-time analysis shows a decrease in support for Europe from +.30 in
              | 1990 to +.11 in 2002. Once again, this is similar to the general trend emerging
              | in the other European countries covered by the Europub.com project: the
              | average mean for support for Europe of the seven European countries fell
              | from +.39 in 1990 to +.19 in 2002 (Koopmans, 2004: 43).
              | The general attitudes towards Europe of the different types of actor vary
              | greatly according to the issue under debate. In a cross-issue perspective, civil
              | society claims on European issues that explicitly express a positive attitude
              | to increased Europeanization are at a high level for European integration
              | (+.16) and agriculture (+.18). Education is the policy ﬁeld where non-
              | institutional actors mostly express criticism on European integration (–.11).
              | Institutional actors, in contrast, appear more cautious in supporting Europe
              | in claims-making concerning agriculture (+.07) and troop deployment (0.00),
              | as well in debates concerning monetary policy (+.15).
              | The attitudes of civil society actors towards the European process are also
              | strongly differentiated across policies. Economic interest groups are more
              | critical of Europe when the debate speciﬁcally concerns EU integration (–.09)
              | and more favourable when the claims-making concerns pensions (+.29), agri-
              | culture (+0.18) or monetary policy (+.16). Social movements, in contrast,
              | express more positive positions regarding Europe in the debate concerning
              | European integration (+.24) than when they talk about pensions (–1.00) or
              | education (–.17).10
              | Conﬂict related to the process of European integration is especially high
              | on issues relating to the welfare state and social rights, where the European
              | Union is not considered to have a good track record. These results, which
              | concern much more than the general process of European integration, there-
              | fore seem to point to dissatisfaction among non-institutional actors with EU
              | politics, conﬁrming the worry that a lack of ‘positive integration’ (Scharpf,
              | 1999) is weakening support for Europe among citizens concerned about
              | welfare issues.

              | 1 0 1
              | These ﬁndings on the conﬂictual participation of civil society actors may
              | be better interpreted by turning to the qualitative data generated from our
              | interviews. The interview partners were asked about their general percep-
              | tions and evaluation of the process of European integration, and how they
              | judged the role and performance of EU institutions in this context (‘How do
              | you perceive the process of European integration more generally? What direc-
              | tion is it taking? Do you agree with this development? And how do you see
              | the role and performance of EU institutions in this context?’). The analysis of
              | the attitudes of various national actors towards Europe conﬁrms broad
              | support for European integration, but in terms of very different conceptions
              | of Europe. Europe emerged as an ‘imagined community’ that meant very
              | different things to different collective actors. In the 1990s, in particular, the
              | European one was part of a multi-level territorial identity compatible with
              | other territorial identities (Fabbrini, 2003: 19). But different actors also tend
              | to construct different Europes. In part, these deﬁnitions overlapped with the
              | traditional distinction between Europe as an economic enterprise, based on
              | the pragmatic support of national economies (which appeared to be the view
              | characteristic of many institutional actors), and Europe as a federation based
              | upon a common destiny and common values, with a particular commitment
              | to peaceful interaction (which is the ‘model’ mentioned most often by non-
              | institutional interview partners). For example, when considering actors’
              | expectations and normative statements about the future of European integra-
              | tion, institutional actors worried more about instrumental/economic issues
              | (conﬁrming the image of a ‘regulatory’ Europe), whereas civil society actors
              | focused on the political and social construction of Europe.
              | From the instrumental point of view, enlargement and the euro are
              | perceived by centre–right institutional actors and interest groups as challeng-
              | ing decisions, especially in a period characterized by economic difﬁculties
              | (see, for example, interviews 11, 12 and 1311). Enlargement, in particular, is
              | considered to be risky by those who conceive of European integration as
              | mainly legitimized by economic advantages – all the more so for a country
              | that has, until now, enjoyed high levels of EU funding for cohesion policies.
              | In the more Eurosceptic deﬁnition, enlargement is ‘an acceleration that does
              | not take into account the problems of the assimilation of the member states’
              | (Lega Nord, interview 14).
              | Most civil society actors focused instead on identity issues – demanding
              | a democratic and social Europe, but criticizing the EU’s weakness on both
              | issues. As for the ‘democratic deﬁcit’, many NGOs stressed the need for a
              | ‘bottom-up’ process to develop European politics. As the general secretary of
              | the Movimento Federalista Europeo sums it up: ‘The EU Council is not
              | good because, from the point of view of constitutional doctrine, it is not a
              | 1 0 2
              | European Union Politics 7(1)
              | democratic institution’ (interview 1). Similarly, other social movement
              | organizations complained about the weak powers of the European Parliament
              | vis-à-vis the European Council (see, for instance, interviews 2 and 6), arguing
              | that ‘the construction of the European Union comes from the top and there
              | is no low level, except for the movements that attempt to inﬂuence ‘high
              | politics’’ (interview 5).
              | More generally, civil society actors are critical of the direction of European
              | integration, but not on the basis of a traditional ‘nationalist’ Euroscepticism
              | that defends the nation-state (Marks, 2004). Criticisms are framed using the
              | language of class cleavages rather than territorial ones. Although social
              | movement organizations agree on the importance of a European level of
              | government and citizenship, they stigmatize EU policies as being oriented
              | towards economic success instead of social equality, ‘privileging the market
              | over the people’. As the spokesperson for Rete Lilliput, a network of NGOs
              | working on global inequalities, stressed: ‘We are favourable to the process of
              | integration but we don’t agree with the political direction it is currently
              | taking’ (interview 10). The representative of the ‘critical’ union Cobas (inter-
              | view 3) conﬁrms this image of the EU as a neo-liberal institution, interested
              | in economic growth but not in social equality: ‘I disagree with the direction
              | of the process of integration because it is primarily an economic, a ﬁnancial
              | one. It is not integration by popular consultation’; a ‘Europe that liberalizes
              | more and more the free movement of commodities and dirty money but not
              | persons. It condemns thousands of citizens to death with its restrictive laws
              | on immigration’ (interview 4).
              | To summarize, the need to construct a supranational level of governance
              | is recognized but the weakness of political and social Europe is criticized.
              | This tension between general support for Europe and criticisms of speciﬁc
              | EU policies is acknowledged by, amongst others, the leader of the farmers’
              | organization Altragricoltura, who stated:
              | We are critical of the fact that integration is only a conquest of markets, and that
              | there is no reﬂection upon what kind of Europe we want. The European Union
              | is the only opportunity we have for imagining a different model of economic
              | development from the American one. We defend this possibility but we don’t
              | agree with the reality of the European Union’s concrete choices; we are living a
              | contradiction. (Interview 8)
              | Our interviews with various types of non-institutional actors indicated,
              | however, that although civil society organizations are more critical than
              | institutional actors (in terms of their position on increasing European integra-
              | tion), such organizations (including social movements) have very high levels
              | of interest in the development of European policies and consider the EU level

              | to be very important for the present as well as for the future. Social move-
              | ments express the least support for the European Union, but they show a
              | higher level of interest in it than political parties do; they share a fairly strong
              | belief in the relevance of the European policy level, and an even stronger
              | conﬁdence in its future inﬂuence.
              | The Europeanization of public discourse and civil society:
              | Some conclusions
              | Our data indicate that, at least when looking at Italy, there is a certain degree
              | of Europeanization of public discourse in terms of the presence of European
              | claimants, targets and framings of issues, but that this process has speciﬁc
              | characteristics. It is selective, insofar as it involves some policy areas but not
              | others; it is mainly top-down, in the sense that non-institutional actors are
              | less present than institutional ones in public debates on Europeanized issues;
              | and it is increasingly contested, in Italy not so much in terms of opposition
              | to a European polity (i.e. to the building of new geographical borders), but
              | more on the basis of speciﬁc European policies (in particular, the weakness
              | of social policies) and European politics ( the ‘democratic deﬁcit’ is linked not
              | only to the weakness of the elective EU body, the Parliament, but also to the
              | lack of transparency of European integration processes) (della Porta et al.,
              | 2003; della Porta and Caiani, 2004; della Porta, 2003b). Other recent studies
              | have found similar results in other countries, indicating a certain general
              | degree of Europeanization (Koopmans, 2004; Trenz and Eder, 2004) accom-
              | panied by issue speciﬁcity (Seidendorf, 2003).
              | Principally, our results have conﬁrmed that, in terms of political oppor-
              | tunities, multi-level governance is reﬂected in domestic public discourse. As
              | expected, Europe is more widely discussed in those policy areas where the
              | EU institutions have more competences (especially in monetary policy), but
              | some degree of Europeanization also emerged in policies that remained more
              | within the control of national institutions. Moreover, public discourse on
              | European actors and issues became more and more prominent over time.
              | Even if European institutions function as an additional level of oppor-
              | tunity, our research conﬁrms that the ability of collective bodies to access
              | supranational levels depends upon their ‘regulative, jurisdictional and
              | material resources’, and that ‘European integration distributed these oppor-
              | tunities of access to extraterritorial resources . . . in a differential and unequal
              | way’ (Bartolini, 2002: 8; emphasis added). In Italy, although also in other
              | European countries (Koopmans, 2004), acting at the supranational level seems
              | relatively less expensive for actors that are already resource rich at home. In

              | 1 0 5
              | addition, limited references to Europe by non-institutional actors indicate that
              | as a result of an initial focus on the negative aspects of integration – in particu-
              | lar on the free market and economic competition – Europe still does not give
              | much symbolic leverage to actors advocating EU citizenship as including the
              | protection of social rights. The higher level of reliance on institutional sources
              | by journalists covering supranational issues also seems to play a role in
              | limiting the presence of civil society actors in these debates (Bennet et al.,
              | 2003). When looking at public discourse, it seems that the processes of Euro-
              | peanization strengthen those who are already strong nationally, while further
              | marginalizing the weak.
              | Nevertheless, the growing Europeanization of claims-making by social
              | movements and associations indicates that (although perhaps making a virtue
              | of necessity) civil society actors realize that they cannot remain conﬁned to
              | their own nation-states. If decisions shift to the supranational level, then
              | claims-makers must adapt accordingly and try to reduce their disadvantages
              | in addressing a new level of governance. For resource-poor collective actors
              | in particular, it seems important to combine different territorial levels of inter-
              | vention by framing concerns in a more European dimension while simul-
              | taneously holding on to potential allies in national politics.
              | The Europeanization of public discourse does not imply increasing
              | consensus on the EU polity or policies. Our data indicate that European inte-
              | gration also involves the interplay of territory and class (or, at least, left–right)
              | cleavages, although not to the same extent as occurred during the construc-
              | tion of the nation-state. The Europeanization process is, in fact, more and
              | more conﬂictual – including within public discourse. Together with the
              | growth of protests addressing European targets (Imig, 2004), decreasing
              | support for European institutions indicates the failure of output legitimiza-
              | tion based upon results rather than input procedures. Long before citizens in
              | France and the Netherlands voted against the European Constitution, opinion
              | polls had signalled a decline in citizen satisfaction with the development of
              | EU institutions, with about half of Europeans dissatisﬁed (Pache, 2001;
              | Méchet and Pache, 2000), and European institutions are regularly criticized
              | for being ‘bureaucratic, inefﬁcient and for lacking transparent procedures’ (Le
              | Torrec et al., 2001: 8). The output of the EU seems insufﬁcient, if not negative,
              | to many collective actors. In particular, with reference to the interaction
              | between territorial and social cleavages, our research conﬁrms the presence
              | of a tension between a vision of Europe as promoting a regulated capitalism
              | that addresses social concerns and a neo-liberal vision that is opposed to the
              | expansion of EU competences and instead promotes deregulation (as stressed
              | by Hooghe et al., 2004; Marks, 2004).
              | Our research suggests that the growing criticism of the EU does not
              | 1 0 6
              | European Union Politics 7(1)
              | necessarily take the form of Euroscepticism. Even if, in Italy, support for
              | European integration tends to remain widespread, there has been a recent
              | increase in contestation of the direction of EU policies, particularly among
              | non-institutional actors. Our research allows us to go beyond the observation
              | of a growing scepticism in order to distinguish the image of Europe around
              | which consensus and/or dissent emerges. The speciﬁcity of a ‘critical consen-
              | sus’, especially on the Left, can be explained by the characteristics of the
              | European construction process and its inherent tension between instrumen-
              | tal and identitarian images, which prevail, respectively, among civil society
              | and institutional actors. Ever since its beginnings, the EU has in fact been a
              | reaction to the weakening of the European nation-state in certain key areas –
              | from the military defence of frontiers to the expansion of markets. As Bartolini
              | puts it, the process of territorial de-differentiation that is at the root of
              | European integration ‘ﬁnds its initial inspiration in two elements of the new
              | international constellation that followed on from the Second World War. The
              | ﬁrst was the evidently intolerable cost of historical rivalry between the
              | European states in an era when the destructiveness of war technology had
              | grown out of all proportion to what was at stake in said rivalry. The second
              | was the growing pressure coming from the potential economic marginaliza-
              | tion of Europe in the world economy’ (Bartolini, 2002: 405). The de-territori-
              | alization of defence and the market that was the foundation of the European
              | construction stood, however, in contrast to the maintenance at the national
              | level of decisions over redistribution issues. Even more problematically,
              | where member states have retained their competences on social policies (and
              | in particular, as we have seen, on education and pensions, which are areas
              | strictly related to national integration), monetary policies (and the related
              | ‘stability pact’) have deprived national governments of some of their main
              | instruments for intervening in matters of social inequality.
              | To conclude, our research conﬁrms that European integration demands ‘a
              | commitment to construct a system, that involves the creation of at least a level
              | of cultural identity and of citizenship able to sustain the principle of social
              | sharing of risks and mechanisms of legitimate political decisions’ (Bartolini,
              | 2002: 412). The EU’s launching of campaigns on general ethical issues, such as
              | gender equality, anti-racism and human rights (Trenz, 1999), is evidence of the
              | search for a moral basis for a collective identity. Such a moral basis would be
              | equivalent to what the nation represented in the construction of the state. Our
              | research singles out this need and the dissatisfaction with the EU’s response
              | to it, which is judged to be hopelessly inadequate.

              | historical years, and 52 days for the most recent) only claims with a European
              | scope in at least one of the basic aspects of the claim (actors, addressees, issue)
              | were coded, we based most of our analyses on full sample issues only. By
              | doing this we avoid overrepresenting claims with a European dimension,
              | thus drawing a fair picture of the degree to which ‘Europe’ is present in the
              | national public sphere. We indicate in the text when the reduced sample is
              | added.
              | 4 In general, as many as 83.5% (institutional actors) and 92.5% (non-insti-
              | tutional actors) of all claims on pensions and about 90% (for both types of
              | actor) of all claims on education have a national, Italian issue scope. Monetary
              | policy claims with a national issue scope account for a share of 9.5% for insti-
              | tutional actors and 19.6% for non-institutional actors; claims on agriculture
              | for 18.6% and 44.4%; claims on immigration for 61.3% and 83.5%; and claims
              | on troop deployment for 0% for both types of actors.
              | 5 For parties, claims with a European issue scope remain nearly constant across
              | the years (about 6–7%), with a signiﬁcant peak in 1995 (15.6%).
              | 6 Claims directed to other EU member states slightly decreased for state actors
              | (from 15.0% in 1990 to 7.4% in 2002), whereas for civil society actors they
              | remained nearly constant at about 3–4%.
              | 7 For the typology and the related analyses, we considered only claims that
              | have a European issue scope, in order to obtain a data set of claims launched
              | 1 0 8
              | European Union Politics 7(1)
              | in response to the policies or institutions of the EU (EU-based claims).
              | According to this criterion, we selected 1625 ‘EU-based claims’ from a total
              | of 3541 claims.
              | 8 We aggregated action forms into the following broad categories: political
              | decision/executive action, verbal action (e.g. communication events such as
              | press releases) and protest/direct democratic action. We considered as
              | conﬂictual all those claims in which protest/direct democratic action was
              | used, plus all those accompanied by criticism of their targets. Indeed, calls
              | and appeals for speciﬁc targets may be made either in a neutral sense or with
              | expressions of criticism or support for the actors they target. We measured
              | the evaluation of addressees, giving a score of –1 for negative judgements
              | and +1 for support, with 0 for a neutral position.
              | 9 The attitude towards increased European integration (Figure 3) was recorded,
              | for both samples, only for claims that had a European dimension in the issue
              | scope. Position scores were computed only for cells with 5 or more cases.
              | Overall, the mean for all actors during the period under study (N claims =
              | 1623) is +0.24 (+0.30 in 1990; +0.25 in 1995; +0.31 in 2000; +0.11 in 2002); for
              | institutional actors +0.28 (+0.37 in 1990; +0.27 in 1995; +0.36 in 2000; +0.14 in
              | 2002), for social movements +0.10 (0.00 in 1990 and 1995; +0.19 in 2000; +0.03
              | in 2002), for economic interest groups +0.14 (–0.11 in 1990; +0.30 in 1995; +0.21
              | in 2000; +0.04 in 2002), for parties +0.10 (+0.17 in 1990 and 1995; +0.20 in 2000;
              | –0.12 in 2002), and for the media +0.13 (0.00 in 1990; +0.17 in 2000; +0.09 in
              | 2002).
              | 10 Parties and the media expressed signiﬁcant support for Europe only in the
              | debate about European integration (from about +0.15 to +0.17); in all the other
              | policy ﬁelds they expressed neutral or ambivalent positions.
