              | Self-perception of nurses…
              | INTRODUCTION
              | C
              | urrently, the use of alcohol and other drugs is seen by the Brazilian public
              | health as a serious problem that requires actions geared toward prevention and treatment
              | of disorders associated with their consumption, with broad complexity and magnitude, since
              | their effects significantly affect the health and quality of life of users, their families and
              | society. Must be understood as a multidimensional and global problem, not restricting to
              | the relationship between the individual and the consumption of psychoactive substances.1-2
              | This being a social problem, there is a need for government intervention in order to
              | prevent its spread and to promote greater support to these users and their families.3
              | Accordingly, after the Decade of 90, there was the structuring of the network of specific
              | attention to these people, by setting standards and guidelines for the Organization of
              | services that provide assistance in mental health, such as the centers of psychosocial care
              | (CAPS), ad CAPS included, for the treatment of users of alcohol and other drugs.4-6
              | Thus, the primary health care strategy in relation to the consumption of alcohol and
              | other drugs is the ad CAPS using harm-reduction strategies as tools in prevention and health
              | promotion, particularly by supporting national programme for Integrated Community
              | Attention to users of alcohol and other drugs.7
              | Guided by psychosocial model, the ad CAPS are proposed as a space of creativity,
              | life-building, rather than delete, and should receive disciplinary medicalizing, care for and
              | build bridges with the society, considering the user in its subjective and socio-cultural
              | implications, electing him as the protagonist of your treatment.8-9
              | These nurses appears as a great contributor to this process of user assistance, not in
              | isolation, but cooperatively with the other professionals involved.10-11 This study aimed to
              | analyze the general perception of nurses about assistance to users of alcohol and drugs from
              | a day-care Center. Had specific goals: characterize the nursing assistance directed to users
              | of the ad CAPS; identify the conduct of work used during the service to users, and describe
              | the difficulties for operationalization of the attention model proposed by ad CAPS.
              | METHOD
              | The study on the screen had the backdrop of the day-care Centre for users of alcohol
              | and other drugs in the city of Sousa, Paraiba. With regard to assistance to mental health,
              | the town has a CAPS III (assistance towards hospitalization short), a CAPS i (assistance to
              | children and adolescents), ad CAPS a (service for users of alcohol and other drugs) and two
              | therapeutic homes, linked to the Municipal Health Secretariat. The ad CAPS has seven years

              | of working with a team of twenty-seven professionals (psychiatrist, doctor general
              | practitioner, psychologist, social worker, nurse, artisan, diplomacy, physical educator,
              | monitors, Cook, administrative officer and general services assistants), and the nursing staff
              | composed of three nurses.
              | As for the type it is an exploratory, descriptive study with a qualitative approach.
              | We used a non-probability sample of convenience constituted by 03 nurses who work in the
              | day-care Center alcohol and drugs from the town of Shah-PB. To choose the participants
              | delimited as inclusion criteria: being a nurse, be acting in the ad CAPS there are at least 6
              | months and agree to participate in the study through the signing of an informed consent.
              | The data were collected between October and November 2011, through a socio-
              | demographic questionnaire for characterization of participants and a semi-structured
              | interview script with the intention of seizing the perception of subjects surveyed provided
              | for research objectives.
              | Worth pointing out that only one participant allowed to record the interview, others
              | preferred to answer the written instrument. The interviews were transcribed in full and,
              | after careful reading, identified concordances in the context, that allowed the grouping of
              | topics, such as Thematic Content Analysis guides,12 which consists of discovering the nuclei
              | of meaning that make up a communication whose presence or frequency has significance to
              | the analytic goal targeted.
              | The study complied with the provisions contained in resolution 466/2012 National
              | Health Council-CNS, which deals with research involving humans. Due respect to human
              | dignity requires that all research process after informed consent of the subject individual or
              | groups by themselves and/or their legal representatives, expressing their consent to
              | participation in research. Thereby the research started by the project approval by the
              | Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Paraiba, under protocol number
              | 0513.0.133.000-11.
              | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
              | From the socio-economic data obtained in the course of the present research was a
              | characterization of the participants, while the subjective data were analyzed from Content
              | Analysis,12 technique allowing the grouping of topics organized into two categories: the

              | time of operation of these professionals in mental health services varies from 1 to 6 years,
              | with 20 working hours to 40 hours per week.
              | Nursing work
              | The nursing staff of the ad CAPS de Sousa is formed only by nurses, not existing as
              | professionals in the technical level. Nurses are responsible for all activities, bureaucratic-
              | administrative nursing and welfare that can be divided into: individual calls consisting of
              | nursing consultations (clinical intercurrences), triage, greeting, note and contact with
              | users, administration and delivery of medication, checking vitals, orientation, nursing care
              | (the patient's evolution, individual therapeutic project); group sessions (groups of health
              | guidance and proper use of the medication); workshops and family care.
              | The professionals point to the experience and the fact that the team be
              | interdisciplinary as reason facilitator for the performance of nursing activities, in addition
              | to the autonomy of the ad CAPS, to troubleshoot at all levels of health care users, the
              | availability of auto, the support of the Municipal Health Secretariat and the direction of the
              | institution and the identification with the work area. This can be verified in the
              | Testimonials below:
              | (...) There is an interest of the whole team to get resolutions on the
              | user, the municipal government help in various matters such as
              | material, structure, there's no shortage of medicines (...) has a car
              | available in the unit to go to the user if you did not attend the
              | service (...) there is a very large support that is given to us the
              | direction, coordination of mental health and all employees involved
              | in the process. (P1.)
              | First, I can totally relate to mental health, and especially with the
              | work developed in the ad CAPS, the team is also a big promoter,
              | since we are very united and we work really closely. Another
              | important factor is the level of professionals; we have enough
              | trained professionals on the team, so I learn a lot with them. (P2).
              | Join a team with more experience and multidisciplinary, is very
              | important and very helpful. (P3).
              | Difficulties faced
              | The difficulties pointed out as obstacles to exercise the nursing work in service are
              | related to lack of training/training for professionals working in this area and the absence of
              | a satisfactory health services assistance (general hospital, outpatient services) users of
              | alcohol and drugs during the night. When asked whether at some point were qualified to
              | work in ad CAPS and what kind of training, respondents have positioned themselves as
              | follows:
              | (...) When we arrived in the unit I personally only seen thing of CAPS
              | on paper and little, was only a just class, so when we got here didn't
              | know anything about the CAPS and how it would deal with the user
              | (...). (P1).
              | (...) to start the work on this service wasn't qualified, however, in
              | the period that I started the team attending monthly supervision
              | proposed by the Ministry of health and it was during these

              | supervisions that many questions about the service were clarified.
              | (P2).
              | There was a training made by the State, the municipal government
              | made a training project and in this capacity she was divided into two
              | parts, one devoted to mental health was made during the day at the
              | federal University (...) and the night was a system geared more for
              | the ad CAPS than would be the ad CAPS. (P3).
              | With respect to lack of assistance during the night period at health services users of
              | alcohol and drugs, two of the participants emphasized:
              | Most participants referred to the fact that the service is of type II, limits the ducts as
              | well as the effectiveness of the activities carried out and consider that the ad CAPS or CAPS
              | 12:0 am ad III would be a new possibility, qualified and effective assistance. And as
              | alternatives to improve the service, pointed out the need for better organization and hiring
              | more professionals.
              | The lack of a more intensive care so we could watch the user in a
              | more complex, both during the day and night, for which we had paid
              | attendance during the crisis of abstinence but also during the Detox
              | phase. Another difficulty is the lack of specific programmes for
              | crack users, as well as the lack of investments in the training of
              | professionals working in this area. (P1).
              | (...) the ad CAPS is a clinic day, many users pass through the issue of
              | abstinence and the general hospitals of the city (...) do not want to
              | answer user (...) we evaluates and administers medication during
              | the day, but when it comes to the end of the afternoon send home,
              | he gets the care and suffering of the family (...) it would be
              | interesting to the creation of the ad CAPS III with ease of access.
              | (P3).
              | (...) We listen to our users on a daily basis the difficulty facing the
              | night on the streets, especially those who can't stay abstinent and
              | that require a period to Detox. The ad CAPS II limits the
              | effectiveness of treatment. Have the ad CAPS III 24 hours would be
              | good, because it would solve the greatest difficulty of users which is
              | the night. (P1).
              | (...) The ad CAPS II treatment needs to be complemented at the ad
              | CAPS III, since there are different stages of treatment. The ad CAPS
              | III would be for users who require intensive care to undergo a
              | detoxification and the ad CAPS II would continue treatment with the

              | The participants reported being part of a team that acts of interdisciplinary and
              | intersectoral manner.
              | (...) The reform, especially in relation to the users of the ad CAPS
              | (...) Enables a resocialization. (P1).
              | (...) I see a great freedom of thought from the user, a larger range
              | of offers treatment options, he stays in the unit because he wants at
              | his interest (...) So in my view this reform of the psychiatric
              | evaluation for the CAPS for users with problems with drugs ad CAPS
              | is the great evolution (...). (P2).
              | (...) Everybody integrates and is part of all (...) on individual
              | therapeutic project all professionals will be part (...) so without the
              | weekly meetings to discuss the causes and problems of the users,
              | the people would be a bit lost in the treatment (...). (P1).
              | (...) We invite every once in a while someone from a. (...) currently
              | also the Masonic lodge does activities with users (...) the people
              | invites to do lectures teachers from the University, some users with
              | problems in justice, always maintaining this partnership. We are
              | discussing the possibility of a law favoring the drug user, who hire a
              | drug user pay less taxes (...) currently sense society has shown
              | greater interest in the person and not the fact that she use drugs or
              | not. (P3).
              | The nurses had knowledge about the harm-reduction policy and apply it in CAPS,
              | fashion ad not advocated, adopting strategies such as syringe Exchange programs (SEPS),
              | Methadone maintenance programs or with the integration of professional Damage reducers
              | to the community health Agents program (PACS), but running harm reduction encouraging
              | progressive withdrawal. One can observe this through the following speeches:
              | It's a new way to reducing the harm associated with the use of
              | psychoactive drugs by focusing on prevention. However, if we had a
              | professional damage reduction would be implemented more
              | effectively. (P1).
              | Yes, people use the service damage reduction (...) with the time we
              | began to understand that these users were an evolutionary process
              | (...) in recovery and any proposal for intervention that make him
              | reduce the amount of drugs they are using is positive (...) the little
              | that they can too. (P3).
              | Of the nurses who participated in the research, it might be noted that these do not
              | use the Systematization of nursing care (SAE) as a way of organizing the assistance
              | provided, in accordance with the following lines:
              | At the moment, no. (P1).
              | No (P2)

              | the assistance provided to the services performed in the ad CAPS, as evidenced by two of
              | the participants:
              | SAE is a way of visualizing more complex clinical diagnoses of our
              | users and so we can watch them, too, so more complex. (P1).
              | It is a way to view the user beyond the dependency. (P2).
              | Of the participants surveyed only one believes that SAE does not improve the
              | assistance because it believes this applies better clinical pathologies and not changes of
              | behavior and psychological needs.
              | I think so maybe the individual therapeutic project is an adaptation
              | that we did for the CAPS than would be more like the
              | systematization of nursing care (...) the therapeutic evaluation of
              | the project here is long-term, the systematization as we get more
              | clinical patients she's kinda developed more to the clinic, such
              | assistance is kind daily (...) but here the more you go moving
              | surfacing the issues of psychological area you will see that they are
              | more in the long run, so this doesn't get daily revaluation (...). (P3).
              | Interaction with the family
              | In relation to the family triad-user-professional, participants pointed out benefits of
              | this relationship and it was observed that this is of the utmost importance, as you can see in
              | the following lines:
              | The benefits are when the family accompanies the user, the
              | treatment is more effective. (P1).
              | Since the founding of the ad CAPS the symbol that we initially used
              | was a triangle with three hands, one hand would be the user, other
              | professionals and the third of the family, without the three
              | treatment doesn't work (...) the family participates enough (...) is
              | always interested in the treatment of users (...) without the
              | participation of her treatment is in half (...) the answer is being
              | very positive (...). (P2).
              | Our unit conducts weekly meetings with the family because it is very
              | important to have this family-team interaction. Nursing has great
              | access to the user's family, since, in the vast majority, the family
              | accompanies the user to medical consultation, but also in the
              | delivery of medication. It is very important that there is feedback
              | between staff and family. (P3).
              | The vast majority of households have a feeling of revolt with the
              | situation because they feel that there is nothing more to do for that
              | user recovery and that at any moment all come back again, so his
              | family wants to get rid of that problem, sometimes it's something
              | even unconscious (...).(P2).
              | One of the participants shows that the main difficulty in the family relationship with
              | the user:
              | Is explicit that this service professionals seek to carry out interaction with the
              | family, considering it as part of the treatment team as you can see in the following
              | statements:
              | (...) as the family begins to understand what's going on, what is our
              | policy and what are the expectations, she spends to help in the

              | team to treat the user (...). (P2).
              | (...) We have to keep this family together and following the
              | proposed treatment, showing that you have a recovery time (...).
              | (P3).
              | Generally speaking, you can see through the lines of the nurses that there was a
              | major breakthrough in assisting those users, but there is still much to be achieved in this
              | area, and especially in the institution search. The lack of training and failures in the
              | structure and dynamics of service compromises the quality of assistance provided. However,
              | to have a team committed to the therapeutic project, with the inclusion of the user in this
              | process is the best way to achieve abstinence, effectively.13
              | The participants emphasize that the interdisciplinarity of the team and intersectoral
              | approach in the municipality are facilitators for the performance of nursing activities. This
              | fact could be perceived through the autonomy demonstrated by professional ad CAPS to
              | troubleshoot at all levels of attention. This result is in line with a study, which found that
              | the professionals shared their knowledge and realized the need for training within the work
              | environment.14
              | The insertion of the nurse in the ad CAPS seems to be facilitated by the good
              | relationship with the multidisciplinary team that has, in terms of interdisciplinarity, the
              | ability to absorb the knowledge of nurses and recognize that this is important to the success
              | of the proposed therapy. The interdisciplinary work requires team members to socialize
              | their roles, providing reduction of hierarchical organization for collective work and
              | egalitarian.15
              | The context evidenced in speech of participants consistent with the opinion of other
              | studies by saying that the intersectoral approach must represent an area of knowledge
              | sharing, of structuring new languages, new practices and new concepts. Its construction is
              | part of a transformative process in plan, perform and evaluate the actions in order to
              | promote a reordering in the implementation of specific manifestations in the set of public
              | policies.16
              | The difficulties pointed out as obstacles to exercise the nursing work in service were
              | related to structure and dynamics, as lack of professionals, absence of CAPS and support
              | services of empowerment/training. Referred to by professional dissatisfaction about the
              | absence of qualification confirms with the study that shows that nurses have received little
              | information and training about the context of alcohol and other drugs, which contributes to
              | the lack of theoretical basis.17 This question deserves highlight by little mobilization of
              | managers to offer appropriate training for professionals who participate in work as specific
              | as that service.
              | With the psychiatric reform it needs professionals in the area of mental health in
              | order to achieve the necessary quality for watching humanly the user. The knowledge
              | arising from specialization courses or training programs allow nurses a better preparation
              | for dealing with patients with mental suffering and the possibility of creating new forms of
              | work organization, which consider the relationships between users, the team and the
              | community, in addition to become safe and self-critical about their assistance.18

              | Of the nurses who participated in the survey, could not use the SAE, however,
              | understand the importance of this process and consider that their deployment could
              | improve the assistance provided. On this context, the literature states that SAE is vitally
              | important to plan and execute individualized care to the user.9 Nursing processes, linked or
              | not to theories of nursing, are based on the method of scientific resolution of problems and,
              | therefore, its proposal phases information, the problem definition, the option for a solution,
              | testing it by evaluating their results and trying other solutions if the first has not been
              | satisfactory.19
              | According to reports, one realizes that the nursing staff uses a therapeutic project
              | that meets the unique needs of each subject, in order to ensure that a link in the
              | relationship between nurse-user. Thus, the end compares the individual therapeutic SAE
              | project, because, in a way, systematizes the ducts and goals for each user with a unique
              | difference: there is no diagnostic formulation.
              | All participants agree that the deinstitutionalization was and is a process of change
              | that offers better expectations and freedom not only for the user, but also to the
              | professional. However, point to a flaw that possibly, if well-articulated, could improve not
              | only the assistance provided, but that would be the deployment of 24 hours CAPS.
              | It was noted further that the family is perceived as co-responsible for the user, but
              | to see him accompanied by CAPS attempts to "abandon" the problem by placing the
              | responsibility on the team and only on the institution itself. Thus, the professionals report
              | that seek to encourage and strengthen this bond with the family focusing on the well-being
              | of every user.
              | Such a situation consistent with a survey conducted in one of the ad CAPS of Minas
              | Gerais in the Southeast region, in which the participation of the family was so effective, not
              | restricting only the meetings in which they discussed matters about the medication and how
              | to deal with particularities of the disease. In this approach, the family participation within
              | the ad CAPS must overcome the role of just object from the actions, but also become
              | subject to actions that get involved with the issue in order to promote the process of
              | reintegration and social rehabilitation, as well as the rescue of their citizenship.20
              | CONCLUSION
              | The issues scored in this study demonstrate the importance of the process of change
              | that happened with the psychiatric reform movement, pointing out that the resocialization
              | and rehabilitation increases the freedom of users and professionals and allow ample
              | possibilities of interventions that, at the same time, produce care and give visibility to the
              | diverse demands of this population in relation to society. Such interventions should be
              | designed in such a way, using intersectoral the concepts of "territory", of "network" and
              | extended logic of harm reduction consistent with the guidelines of the Brazilian psychiatric
              | reform.
