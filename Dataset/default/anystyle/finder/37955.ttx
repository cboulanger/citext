              | Julia Preece
              | This paper describes and analyses various perspectives on participatory
              | rural appraisal and the relationship between its rhetoric and practice,
              | particularly regarding its claims to give voice to the marginalised and
              | contribution to development needs. Drawing on relevant literature that
              | both critiques and provides examples of practice, the paper analyses two
              | case studies to explore what lessons we can learn about the approach
              | and its applicability as a methodology for marginalised social groups in
              | European contexts.

              | 1. Introduction
              | Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) … is a holistic, all encompassing data
              | collection exercise about a whole community. The research process is put
              | as far as possible into the hands of ordinary people. Although ‘experts’
              | (the community educators) are involved, their role is to facilitate, not take
              | over, the investigation. It has very practical goals. The aim of the inquiry
              | is to obtain a detailed understanding and analysis of a specific local con-
              | text; then for local people to prioritise their needs based on this enhanced
              | understanding. The outcome of this process is a community action plan,
              | devised with a view to helping local communities solve their own prob-
              | lems through different local initiatives. The PRA embraces diversity. It
              | can be applied in a range of adult education contexts, such as health, agri-
              | culture, biodiversity and urban planning. It is used to address specific Af-

              | rican problems such as desertification, low food production, declining
              | productivity and fuelwood shortage. PRA, then, is: ‘built on the premise
              | that participation by the beneficiaries in any project is fundamental’ and
              | that ‘locally developed technologies are more likely to succeed’ in build-
              | ing community confidence and capacity (Egerton University 2000, 4). Its
              | strategy is to encourage the use of local cultural values, organisations and
              | knowledge systems for solving problems. The community is involved in
              | every stage of the PRA process (Chilisa/Preece 2005: 198).
              | PRA emanated from countries in the global South1 as a strategy to involve
              | poor rural communities in their own development. Drawing on relevant lit-
              | erature this paper will explore to what extent PRA lives up to its rhetoric, and
              | how effectively it contributes to sustainable outcomes. The paper will also
              | explore what lessons we can learn about PRA and its applicability as a meth-
              | odology for marginalised social groups in European contexts. We begin with
              | a brief introduction to the evolution of PRA as a participatory methodology.
              | 2. Evolution of participatory methodologies
              | Traditional research approaches are often criticised for failing to address is-
              | sues of ownership and control or power relations between the ‘expert aca-
              | demic’ and practitioner or layperson involved in the study (Green et al.
              | 1995). Countries from the so called developing world have particularly
              | voiced their concerns about the way powerful outsiders investigate local
              | communities with only partial knowledge of local contexts (Mulenga 1999).
              | The concept of participatory research, as an antidote to these criticisms, has
              | evolved from a number of directions. On the one hand development agencies
              | and policymakers who sought quick access to socio economic data were re-
              | sponding to critiques of trickle down economic development theory and con-
              | cerns about top-down development without consultation with local communi-
              | ties (Boyde 2000; Campbell 2002; Hayward et al. 2004); on the other hand

              | which are seen as in need of development aid. All terms have derogatory and someti-
              | mes inaccurate connotations. It was felt that this particular term is less offensive than
              | other ones currently in use, whilst recognising that no term accurately describes such a
              | range of countries or their circumstances.

              | communities themselves have increased their demands to be included in deci-
              | sions that affected their daily lives (Hayward et al. 2004). Furthermore, in the
              | past decade there has been increasing emphasis on the need to respect multi-
              | ple voices and a reluctance among researchers to speak for the ‘other’ in con-
              | texts where there were significant power differentials between the researcher
              | and the researched (Cottrell and Parpart 2006). Collaboration and participa-
              | tion have now become an ethical issue in their own right, particularly for the
              | poor and marginalised:
              | In order for pro-poor development to become a reality, poor people them-
              | selves must be not only involved as respondents, but also have access to
              | the information generated, a role in its analysis and in identifying the prac-
              | tical implications for change (Chambers/Mayoux 2005: 7).
              | Gray et al. (2000: 244) argue that the philosophical commitment to participa-
              | tory research has been influenced by these two traditions – third world devel-
              | opment and action research – now ‘subsumed under the unifying umbrella of
              | participatory research’. Participatory methods claimed to produce knowledge
              | that was more valid and reliable in representing context specific ways of
              | knowing the social world (Campbell 2002).
              | The range of terminologies that come under this unifying umbrella are
              | considerable. They include: participatory research, participatory action re-
              | search, action research, collaborative enquiry, emancipatory research and par-
              | ticipatory rural appraisal amongst others (Green et al. 1995). They are seen as
              | being positioned within a range of radical theories such as neo-Marxism,
              | critical theory and feminist frameworks (Mulenga 1999). Fox (2006) suggests
              | that many of these research terms are complementary but different in their
              | approach and purpose. They seem to lie along a continuum of radical to lib-
              | eral goals. At the more radical end he includes amongst them such terms as
              | ‘power-structure research’- as pioneered in Latin America. Here the goal is to
              | reveal injustices and pressure points in the system that causes these injustices
              | so people’s anger will provoke them into targeted action (Fox 2006: 27). On
              | the other hand he sees the ‘testimonial research’ of many feminist scholars as
              | a means of enabling marginalised voices and histories to be heard, so that the
              | ‘other’ is better understood in context. Other participatory research may be
              | focused on making invisible problems visible, so as to redefine what counts
              | Participatory Rural Appraisal 201
              | as a problem and enable us to see, for example, that environmental threats are
              | intertwined with issues of race or class. But there is a common goal of all
              | these terms to shift the focus away from the researcher, who simply raises
              | awareness amongst the researched, to a goal of mutual learning and agenda
              | sharing amongst researchers and participants.
              | So what are the distinctive features of participatory rural appraisal? And
              | does it achieve what it claims to do?
              | 3. Participatory rural appraisal
              | To answer these questions we must briefly explore the origins of the term and
              | look at some of its characteristics. Southern contexts such as Latin America
              | (Percy 1999) and Africa (De Vos 1998 and Mulenga 1999) are often cited as
              | the source of participatory research as a response to development methods
              | that were being overshadowed by neo-colonial interference:
              | Critics of African development such as Julius Nyerere of Tanzania argued
              | that any meaningful development could only be achieved if the people’s
              | culture and popular knowledges were integrated into the process (Mulenga
              | 1999: 3).
              | There were problems with the term participatory research in African devel-
              | opment contexts, however. Development agencies were using the word to-
              | kenistically without transferring any real ownership of the research process or
              | its outcomes. Centralised, top down approaches to development had left the
              | rural poor increasingly dependent on public provision with no sense of own-
              | ership over their own destiny (Chilisa/Preece 2005: 197). Since 2002 decen-
              | tralised governance systems in many countries have provided the impetus to
              | cascade decision making responsibilities down to local communities. This re-
              | quired in most cases a re-training of institutional officers to build confidence
              | in community leadership structures.
              | To facilitate this transition, participatory rural appraisal was offered as a
              | response to policy maker and aid agency needs for quick access to socio eco-
              | nomic data at local levels (Campbell 2002). Drawing on Chambers’ work,
              | Campbell (2002: 21) states that it embodies five principles: to function as a
              | trade-off between the traditional preference for quantifiable data and the real-
              | 202 Julia Preece
              | ity need to collect relevant information; to counteract the biases of develop-
              | ment tourism; to serve as a triangulation method; to provide a flexible way of
              | learning directly from and with rural people; and to be an interactive process
              | that embraces diversity and multiple realities. The goal of PRA is to maxi-
              | mise the skills, knowledge, expertise and analytical skills of village commu-
              | nities through a process of data collection, discussion of issues and possible
              | solutions and the creation of an agreed community action plan that will not
              | only include action by community members themselves, but also engage offi-
              | cials over an agreed timescale. Sometimes the community may raise a par-
              | ticular problem, but more often than not a change agent initiates the process.
              | The people engaged in PRA are not necessarily trained researchers, as the
              | case studies cited in the latter part of this paper demonstrate. Often, therefore,
              | there is a requirement that officials, such as extension workers in rural com-
              | munities, have to review their whole approach to their development responsi-
              | bilities. Instead of seeing farmers or other client groups as mere recipients of
              | new techniques or information provided by the extension workers, for in-
              | stance, the participatory appraisal approach requires a new form of engage-
              | ment, whereby extension workers listen and farmers articulate their local
              | knowledge in a shared process of learning and working together to look for
              | solutions to identified problems (Percy 1999). It is sometimes argued that the
              | main gain from this process is what the researcher-facilitators learn about
              | their clients’ own skills and understanding, rather than new technical knowl-
              | edge that can guide the goal for change or development (Doyle/Krasny
              | 2003).
              | PRA has now evolved into a methodology for use in a variety of situations
              | including urban communities, and it is often now simply known as participa-
              | tory appraisal (PEANuT 2005). While its primary goal is to transfer owner-
              | ship of knowledge creation to communities, it does more than simply gather
              | data, however, since action is the intended outcome. There is an explicit aim
              | to reduce the distance between the researcher and the researched (Gray et al.
              | 2000) and the research process has come to be defined as:
              | Systematic inquiry, with the collaboration of those affected by the issue
              | being studied, for the purposes of education and taking action or effecting
              | social change (Green et al. 1995: 54).
              | Participatory Rural Appraisal 203
              | The process
              | The goal of the participatory appraisal (PA) process is to be as inclusive as
              | possible in collecting views from across the community population. This usu-
              | ally involves several people acting as facilitators, rather than interaction with
              | one researcher. Data collection techniques are designed to be useable
              | amongst communities where literacy levels are low. PA has been described
              | as embracing a family of methods and approaches that involve group based
              | learning and planning, using different techniques to investigate an issue from
              | several different angles (Kapoor 2002). The aim is to gradually build up a
              | knowledge base of whole communities through visual activities, walks, dis-
              | cussions, role play, interviews, photos, seasonal calendars, diagrams – ex-
              | ploring what people think, how they live their lives and specific cultural do-
              | mains of those lives. By recording information from such a diverse range of
              | techniques, and feeding back to community members they are challenged to
              | consider perspectives other than their own in the effort to find common solu-
              | tions. Many of the techniques are borrowed from qualitative social research,
              | though the emphasis is on visual and group data, rather than individualised
              | information.
              | Handbooks for conducting the PA process are documented from a variety
              | of sources (for example Egerton University 2000; Trust for Community Out-
              | reach and Education 2001; Chambers 2002). Although diversity and flexibil-
              | ity is encouraged there is a recommended approach that maximises commu-
              | nity involvement. The Egerton University PRA Field Handbook (2000, 4)
              | proposed eight steps for an external facilitator in the African village context,
              | in the following order: site selection; preliminary site visits to establish con-
              | tact and build relationships; public announcement of activities through tradi-
              | tional information dissemination meetings; data gathering; data collation and
              | analysis; preparation of the community action plan; adoption of the plan and
              | strategies for its implementation; and then ongoing participatory monitoring
              | and evaluation. Community members are usually recruited as co-research fa-
              | cilitators, and also to bridge communication gaps with various population
              | sectors. Whilst the notion of ‘community’, for these purposes, originated as a
              | ‘village community’ it may in different contexts be translated more broadly
              | 204 Julia Preece
              | as, for example, business community (Michaels et al 2001) or special interest
              | group community (Taylor 1999).
              | Data is collected over an extended period. Since this is done in a variety
              | of ways it is often fragmented and needs to be organised by the facilitators,
              | whilst allowing the community members themselves to make sense of the
              | whole. It is often the style of data collection which gives participatory ap-
              | praisal its distinctive feel. Maps are often constructed out of local materials
              | on the ground and only copied onto paper once they are completed. The map
              | evolves through discussion and identification of particular issues. A ‘transect
              | map’ is effectively a walking map, where community members walk through
              | a particular area and talk about various landmarks or activities. In similar
              | fashion, people can discuss interagency links by physically grouping them-
              | selves into large Venn diagrams drawn on the ground, using coloured ribbon
              | or other resources to signify connections or communication links, depending
              | on the community context (Michaels et al. 2001). Other examples of data col-
              | lection include timelines that list key events in the life of a community, sea-
              | sonal and daily calendars that record activities for men and women, liveli-
              | hood maps that list the resources a household needs on a daily basis and
              | where they collect them from. Issues for men and women are often discussed
              | separately, revealing the problematics of gendered decision making in one
              | African context, as the following extract shows:
              | It was no surprise that the problems which the women raised were differ-
              | ent from those of the men. Shortage of wood for fuel is a major problem
              | for the women, for example, as they often have to spend many hours
              | searching for it, and they were therefore very interested in economical
              | stoves. Traditional harmful practices such as circumcision were also men-
              | tioned by the women.
              | The men were more interested in training in non-agricultural fields. In
              | both villages in Oromia, almost half the population no longer have enough
              | land to be able to live off what it produces. These men, most of whom are
              | young, have to hire themselves out as wage labourers on other farms, as-
              | suming that they find work at all (Burkhardt 2000: 310-311).
              | Participatory Rural Appraisal 205
              | During all these activities problems issues and solutions are discussed and re-
              | corded. Occasionally technical data (such as soil testing) is included at the
              | request of the community.
              | If the discussions have been facilitated effectively the causes and potential
              | solutions to problems will be emerging throughout the process in readiness
              | for action planning. At this stage community members often divide into the-
              | matic groups to address particular issues in more detail. The PA team facili-
              | tate decision making by drawing attention to the recorded discussions, includ-
              | ing references to solutions that may have worked in the past. Community ac-
              | tion planning is undertaken through the same participative process, including
              | any identification of training needs that would facilitate action and monitor-
              | ing. An example of such a discussion process is taken from the Trust for
              | Community Outreach and Education (TCOE) Training Manual (2001). This
              | particular scenario represents the final stages of a community empowerment
              | process, facilitated by Nondwe, and designed to address poverty issues in a
              | South African township:
              | Together they analysed the summaries … After a while clear patterns be-
              | gan to emerge …. After a short while, as people calmed down, Nondwe
              | put up a big drawing …. Then she asked … ‘why is there a higher rate of
              | gastroenteritis among children living on the south side of Umzekelo along
              | the banks of the river?’ ‘Because they play in the river most often’, said
              | someone. ‘Yes but who lives there?’ …’the poorest of the poor live in that
              | area’ … Then Eunice got up again and said: ‘That’s another thing our in-
              | vestigation revealed. Gastroenteritis is more prevalent in the areas of
              | greatest poverty in Umzekelo. And infants who get gastroenteritis are
              | more likely to die from dehydration’ ….With Nondwe’s careful facilita-
              | tion, people first began to use their growing understanding of local condi-
              | tions (TCOE 2001: 185) …All that was left to do now was to plan ….
              | Several women … said they would like to present a play based on what
              | they had learnt …Eunice said that she would like to borrow her church
              | minister’s camera and document the health and sanitation problems
              | (TCOE 2001: 191).
              | This example demonstrates that the facilitator needs to be highly skilled at
              | group dynamics, organisation data management and critical awareness rais-
              | ing. Participatory data collection evolves into participatory education in order
              | 206 Julia Preece
              | to arrive at collective action for empowerment and change. Freirian notions
              | of conscientisation or Brookfield’s (1987) description of critical thinking
              | would be appropriate pedagogical skills for the facilitator-as-researcher here.
              | The effectiveness of the process is heavily dependent on how it is managed
              | by the research leaders.
              | 4. Critiques of the process
              | The rhetoric of participation, empowerment and development and the poten-
              | tial of the process to produce sustainable outcomes have come under increas-
              | ing scrutiny, however. The criticisms relate to methodological, outcome and
              | ethical concerns.
              | 4.1
              | Participation techniques
              | Hayward and Simpson (2004) point out that the experience of participation is
              | not always a positive experience for the participants in developing countries
              | in terms of inclusiveness and ownership. Often this reflects poor training on
              | the part of facilitators who are either trained by or are Westerners. The choice
              | of technique may reflect the importing of implicit western cultural bias into
              | different cultural contexts (Campbell 2002). Some data gathering tools can
              | fail to address issues of gender, age or lifestyle (Boyde 2000) meaning that
              | the participants themselves often have to learn new skills in order to partici-
              | pate at all and the nature of the data collected still reflects the goals of the re-
              | searchers. Boyde points out that PRA techniques, in their effort to counteract
              | criticisms of bias in quantitative methods, fail to acknowledge that no data
              | gathering tool is entirely value free. For example visualisation strategies de-
              | signed to enable local people to conduct their own analysis and action plans
              | may fail to take into account the controlling role that facilitators play in steer-
              | ing the group deliberations. Similarly group interviews themselves may ‘not
              | address the problem of selecting members to groups, the composition of the
              | group, or the role of the moderator’ (Campbell 2002: 24). In close association
              | with this concern Green et al (1995) highlight the concern of representative-
              | ness. If only a few self selected individuals take part in the appraisal process
              | they may purport to represent the views of many when this is not the case.
              | Participatory Rural Appraisal 207
              | Chambers and Mayoux (2005: 26) acknowledge that there may be problems
              | in who participates or people’s willingness to contribute. Campbell sums
              | these issues up as a lack of transparency in reporting the techniques and pro-
              | cedures used and lack of flexibility in adjusting to context.
              | Boyde (2000) adds to these concerns by pointing out that PRAs are often
              | conducted by non governmental organisations (NGOs) which are rarely lo-
              | cally owned so this results in a ‘subtle top-down intervention, controlled and
              | managed by external forces’ so that participation actually becomes ‘covert
              | manipulation’ (pages unnumbered). He also reminds us that many of the
              | problems which communities unearth can be attributed to wider structural
              | concerns, over which the facilitators of PRA projects have little control.
              | Sometimes these issues become so large that the process pays insufficient at-
              | tention to highlighting local strengths that could solve more focused prob-
              | lems. At other times there are attempts by researchers to claim more gener-
              | alisable outcomes than localised context specific situations can reflect.
              | The issue of power relations in PRA methodologies, can therefore be hid-
              | den in the discourse of ‘participatory’, thus re-creating all the problems that
              | participatory research claims to overcome. For instance Kapoor (2002) states
              | that there is no quality assurance over the PRA process to ensure that discus-
              | sions are coercion free or the facilitator is not abusing his or her power and
              | authority (p.108). Kapoor also points out that it is unclear how PRA provides
              | opportunities to critique which community claims are erroneous. Further-
              | more, Boyde (2000), Mulenga (1999) and others’ concerns that there is an in-
              | evitable tension between the development practitioner’s values and personal
              | agendas and those of the more career oriented and institutionally pressurised
              | academic require a constant trade-off between the ideology of participation
              | and the reality of the research process. Cottrell and Parpart (2006) suggest
              | that frank and open discussions from the beginning may help to resolve some
              | of these issues.
              | Finally Kapoor (2002) articulates the concern that participatory appraisal
              | literature is under-theorised. Although issues of empowerment and participa-
              | tion are central to its work, there is almost no reference to theoretical notions
              | of power or democracy. He cites Foucault’s concept of power as a relation-
              | ship and the role that power plays in legitimising knowledge. He also refers
              | 208 Julia Preece
              | to Habermasian literature that discusses deliberative democracy as a strategy
              | for challenging the state. The absence of such a critical theoretical overview,
              | he argues, means that ‘difference’ is denied in the pursuit of consensus and
              | political activism is suppressed in favour of liberalism (Kapoor 2002: 114f.).
              | Many of the above criticisms could apply to the mis-use of any methodol-
              | ogy, of course. Chambers and Mayoux (2005) suggest we should look at the
              | problem slightly differently. For instance we should ask how reliable is the
              | alternative – quantitative, top down collected data - in addressing the above
              | concerns, especially those of power relations and the inter-linkages between
              | multi-dimensional aspects of poverty (Chambers/Mayoux 2005: 4). From
              | here we can look for ways to enhance the quality of participatory methodolo-
              | gies, to minimise their deficiencies. Chambers and Mayoux point out that lo-
              | cal people’s knowledge is more useful for community analysis than ‘official’
              | information. But, as the TCOE extract indicated, there is a need for appropri-
              | ate training of facilitators, cultural sensitising and pilot testing of methods.
              | Also analysis should be ongoing, rather than short, one-off exercises. The tri-
              | angulation process is necessary to offset concerns of bias or representative-
              | ness, but the range of tools used need not include diagrams or methods that
              | are inappropriate for any particular circumstance. Chambers and Mayoux ar-
              | gue that although empowerment cannot be assumed, the methods, when used
              | sensitively and correctly have greater potential to increase accountability in
              | the development process:
              | The main challenge is not rigour, but how to enable the poorest to have a
              | voice in definitions and policies for pro-poor growth and civil society de-
              | velopment in the face of institutional prejudice against a process which
              | challenges conventional norms of expertise and power relations (Cham-
              | bers/Mayoux 2005: 18).
              | 4.2
              | Ethical questions
              | So, they and others argue, it is down to questions of ethics as to whose voices
              | are taken seriously and to whom the data belongs. Such concerns include en-
              | suring sensitive community data is not put into the wrong hands – at commu-
              | nity or local government level. Questions that must be asked of the PA pro-
              | ject include: Whose interests are being served? Whose indicators are most
              | Participatory Rural Appraisal 209
              | relevant for assessing the development process? Whose numbers count?
              | Whose analysis is most relevant and reliable? Who needs the information?
              | Who is most likely to be empowered in the process? (Chambers/Mayoux
              | 2005: 18). Boyde (2000) adds a further question: ‘Is this a search to discover
              | something from which all parties can learn?’ (pages unnumbered) and invites
              | us to consider whether the documented outcomes will really help to improve
              | the situation of the least powerful. In other words, whose voices are being
              | heard? Chambers and Mayoux (2005) also raise the issue of how much com-
              | munity time it is ethical to demand of people who are using all their energy to
              | sustain themselves and how much of the data should be removed for analysis
              | from outside of the community itself. Kapoor, however, points out the danger
              | of placing so much emphasis on accepting the validity of community data at
              | the expense of injecting a critical stance into the process:
              | To privilege what is is often to unquestioningly accept the status quo …
              | can mean simplifying or ignoring broader relationships between say local
              | communities and socio economic power structures (Kapoor 2002: 102).
              | We can see, therefore, that the participatory appraisal approach requires sen-
              | sitivity, cultural awareness, and a commitment to giving voice to the disad-
              | vantaged. At the same time it requires an ethical commitment to respect di-
              | versity and difference whilst also facilitating awareness raising and ultimately
              | empowerment through highlighting contradictions in people’s stories, situa-
              | tions and perspectives. The action plan must tread a fine line between too
              | much or too little control and the creation of realistic agendas for change. In
              | particular participants must be facilitated in such a way that they learn to cri-
              | tique themselves and their findings. In adult education terms this cuts across a
              | Frierian conscientisation process or Habermasian concept of deliberative de-
              | mocracy, within feminist or similar critical frameworks that are sensitive to
              | issues of power. An analysis of two case studies taken from very different
              | situations shows the degree of reflexivity required by researchers if they are
              | to maintain an ethical balance. They show the trade-offs or compromises as
              | well as potential for flexibility that participatory appraisal generates and they
              | also demonstrate the applicability of this approach in widely different con-
              | texts.
              | 210 Julia Preece
              | 5. Case studies
              | The author of this paper has used certain aspects of PRA methods as a re-
              | searcher (see Preece/Ntseane 2003 for example)2 and has also been privy to
              | discussions amongst rural development government officers in Botswana
              | about community action plan implementation concerns, and the degree to
              | which PRA can overcome ethnicity exclusions (Mompati and Prinsen 2000).
              | However, recent funding failures have delayed the opportunity for a planned
              | comparative study in PRA. This paper therefore draws on existing literature
              | to critique two case studies in an attempt to reflect on the learning that took
              | place between the researchers and their target participants and the extent to
              | which action for change took place.
              | 5.1
              | Example one
              | The first example is taken from a World Bank funded project in April 1995
              | (Massiah 1997). Its significance lies in the fact that this was, at the time, an
              | innovation for World Bank engagement in non quantitative studies. Its sig-
              | nificance also lies in the extent to which the report could be assessed as fol-
              | lowing a community agenda that would result in community owned out-
              | comes. The report describes the first phase of a project to prevent sexually
              | transmitted diseases and HIV infection in three communities in Nigeria’s Pla-
              | teau State. The research team consisted of personnel from the State Ministry
              | of Health, AIDS Action Managers in the participating local authorities, a uni-
              | versity academic and representative from the World Bank. University stu-
              | dents who spoke the local languages served as interviewers during the field
              | work.

text          | The author was a member of a small team which conducted several open ended focus
              | group discussions with employees in Botswana based companies where employees
              | discussed culturally contextual issues, concerns and possible solutions to the country’s
              | HIV/AIDS pandemic. These responses were then organised into a three-person dialo-
              | gue drama that was played back to the focus groups who responded in terms of action
              | they were prepared to agree with, or not. The author has also participated with African
              | and British students and academics in a participatory appraisal training workshop whe-
              | re participants undertook a variety of appraisal activities including thematically
              | organising and prioritising issues raised by the group, pair ranking and action plan-
              | ning, visual construction of concepts and producing historical time lines.
              | Participatory Rural Appraisal 211
              | The problem situation identified by the researchers was that HIV and
              | syphilis prevalence rates in Nigeria were increasing and the Plateau State had
              | the highest levels in the country. The goal was to collect information about
              | STD/AIDS that could inform subsequent monitoring activities in the areas.
              | The criteria for site selection was that each district contained at least one pri-
              | vate or public health facility and was accessible by road. The three sites are
              | briefly described as follows. Jos North local government authority includes
              | the capital city and is a prime trading centre for long distance truck drivers. It
              | also includes two smaller and more traditional communities that have three
              | different ethnic populations. Mangu local authority has both an urban and ru-
              | ral settlement with four different ethnic groups and the third local govern-
              | ment authority, Langtang, is primarily rural with limited transport facilities.
              | The process of involvement was conducted by the local authority AIDS
              | Action Managers through village elders who introduced the team to their
              | communities. The precise means of selecting the target group is not described
              | in the report (merely saying that ‘participants were selected by their own
              | communities’ (Massiah 1997: 42), but they consisted of professional health
              | workers, traditional healers and pharmacists, male and female community
              | members, long distant truck drivers and STD patients. Interviews with com-
              | mercial sex workers and village elders were conducted by the AIDS Action
              | Managers. Questions related to identifying and prioritising development con-
              | cerns and health concerns. A total of 16 data collection methods were used,
              | including social and institutional mapping, interviews, and matrix ranking.
              | Data was collected over a period of two weeks.
              | Findings were reported bilingually by the team to community meetings, in
              | the form of participatory workshops consisting of participants in the field-
              | work. The research coordinator summarised the research findings and com-
              | munity members commented on issues, prioritised and added to them. A key
              | recommendation in relation to the focus of the study was that health educa-
              | tion should be provided in local languages and be distributed through more
              | traditional communication routes rather than as posters written in English. A
              | number of recommendations for decreasing confusions about picture content
              | in the HIV/AIDS prevention posters were also made. In addition problems of
              | literacy, education, roads and water supply were highlighted by the commu-
              | 212 Julia Preece
              | nity, along with general health concerns such as malaria. Cultural and reli-
              | gious norms impacted on health and sexual behaviour generally. An impor-
              | tant recommendation included the need to foster collaboration between tradi-
              | tional and medical care providers, since community members relied on tradi-
              | tional healers far more than the professionals had realised.
              | Commentary
              | A significant feature of the findings was that the communities themselves did
              | not rank STDs and HIV/AIDS as their main health concerns:
              | In general, women perceive childhood diseases as priorities, and they rank
              | them higher than men do. Among women, the main health concerns are
              | measles, dysentery / diarrhea, and hypertension; men’s main health con-
              | cerns are meningitis, typhoid, and hernia. Malaria is mentioned more by
              | men than women ….. Doctors and nurses identify similar health priorities
              | (Massiah 1997: 16).
              | Indeed lack of health care facilities generally were secondary to wider devel-
              | opment concerns related to poverty, such as existence of potable water, ac-
              | cess to credit and agriculture markets (Massiah 1997: 14). Yet the project’s
              | priorities were STDs and AIDS. This remains the title of the project and these
              | items are the only ones identified in the report summary. This would suggest
              | that although the consultation process was adhered to as a strategy, the re-
              | search team still filtered out the issues that they intended to spend their ener-
              | gies on.
              | Another concern is the nature of who participated. Whilst key people were
              | identified through traditional community structures, it has already been high-
              | lighted that minority ethnic groups are often marginalised in this process
              | since traditional expectations of entitlement and participation can intercede.
              | Mompati and Prinsen (2000), for instance, describe how the participatory ap-
              | praisal process in Botswana resulted in minority ethnic groups and women
              | being systematically excluded from consultation opportunities, or being
              | withdrawn from meetings if they spoke out against dominant values. The
              | World Bank report makes no observation about problems that may have
              | arisen during consultation processes, other than recognising that the lack of
              | Participatory Rural Appraisal 213
              | sustained support at community action planning stages is a reason for failure
              | to implement changes. Furthermore, whilst the field work of two weeks was
              | identified as time consuming, reference is not made to the length of time the
              | workers took to gain access to these communities. Although some of the
              | teams would have been relatively well known to the communities, some may
              | not have been, suggesting that barriers of trust may not have fully dissipated
              | during such a short time-frame.
              | Nevertheless reflection amongst the researchers suggested that the activity
              | itself had built cross-sectoral partnerships and raised the professionals’ con-
              | sciousness of their own biases towards community members, a clearer under-
              | standing of the dynamics of community behaviours and interpretation of
              | health messages, and the potential of communities to identify solutions to
              | their own problems (Massiah 1997: 2). These latter features were a signifi-
              | cant finding of Youngman and Maruatona (1998) during their assessment of a
              | pilot PRA project in Botswana. A key learning curve for appraisal teams is to
              | realise that their communities have relevant skills and knowledge and can ac-
              | tively engage in programme research.
              | For the community members it was felt that the PRA process had facili-
              | tated new partnerships and lines of accountability though they expressed
              | scepticism about the likelihood that action would be taken without sufficient
              | follow-up and input from relevant professionals (Massiah 1997: 2). The issue
              | of sustainability is highlighted particularly when there is a perceived distance
              | between the appraisal team and community members themselves. In spite of
              | its innovatory nature for the World Bank, this project still reflected a top
              | down structure whose limitations filtered through to the participants them-
              | selves. A theoretical understanding in terms of power relations or group dy-
              | namics was not discussed.

              | Community gardeners in the US tend to be low-income minorities and re-
              | cent immigrants living in apartment buildings in neighbourhoods with lit-
              | tle open space and few grocery stores that carry fresh fruit and vegetables.
              | They voluntarily work in the gardens, which provide a place to socialize,
              | relax and appreciate nature, and a means of accessing fresh produce
              | (Doyle/Krasny 2003: 94).
              | The project was stimulated by cooperative extension educators who wanted
              | to use PRA as an educational/community action tool for local youth from the
              | same minority backgrounds as the adult community gardeners. The youth
              | would be trained as PRA researchers to document gardening practices and
              | then conduct community action based on their results. The idea was to stimu-
              | late interest in ‘urban agro-ecology and food systems’ to compensate for the
              | lack of grocery stores. The youth in this case were therefore both researcher-
              | facilitators but also community members who would be expected to subse-
              | quently undertake their own action with their elders. The educators both
              | trained the youth and maintained a presence throughout the PRA exercise,
              | sometimes sharing responsibility for the data collection when the youth en-
              | countered difficulties. The self reflection process therefore took place at three
              | levels – the gardeners, the youth researchers, the educators. Six PRA methods
              | were used – a visual time-line and interviews to document garden history,
              | mapping of plots and gardens and seasonal calendar to identify planting prac-
              | tices, soil tests, Venn diagrams to locate resource flows within the wider
              | community, followed by a shared action plan between gardeners and youth to
              | identify problems and solutions. The project took place over several weeks
              | during the long summer vacation.
              | A total of 31 educators involved 85 youth to work with 26 gardeners
              | across seven neighbourhoods. Youth participants were drawn from commu-
              | nity centres and school gardening programmes serving low-income children.
              | The project author (Doyle) conducted her own assessment of the total process
              | through observations, interactions and interviews at the beginning, middle
              | Participatory Rural Appraisal 215
              | and end of the programme, supplemented by end of project focus groups and
              | youth diaries. Ultimately only four sites followed the full PRA process.
              | A significant action outcome for the project was that youth at two sites
              | started their own garden and at a third site youth developed long term men-
              | toring relationships with their neighbourhood gardeners. They also gave
              | presentations about their findings to gardeners and community members at a
              | garden event and county fairs.
              | Doyle and Krasny (2003) report that the youth experienced some chal-
              | lenges in facilitating the more hands-on activities such as mapping and dia-
              | grams and sometimes the educators helped to adapt the processes, for exam-
              | ple by encouraging the youth to interpret the Venn diagram activity as a
              | ‘puzzle about how the people fit together within the garden’ (p.96). There
              | were also some language and cultural differences between the youth re-
              | searchers and minority ethnic community members. More practical issues to
              | do with time management, transport and attention spans were also cited
              | (Doyle/Krasny 2003: 103). The youth found interviewing a more familiar
              | technique, stimulated by the fact that the gardeners loved telling stories, but
              | the gardeners felt more awkward when asked to draw a map or diagram.
              | Nevertheless, they eventually became deeply engaged in mapping their plots,
              | when the youth started drawing a map and asking gardeners for help in filling
              | the details. The message here, of course, is to fit methods to context.
              | The expertise of the older, minority ethnic research ‘subjects’ and the age
              | differentials for the youth researchers suggest that perhaps power differentials
              | and the subsequent learning processes were unusually complementary in this
              | project. So, for instance, the youth acquired substantial historical knowledge
              | about the evolution of the gardens, the influence of surrounding environment
              | such as pollution on the gardens and connections between the garden and
              | broader city. They increased their knowledge about soils and soil testing.
              | Through the necessary listening process of interviewing they were able to
              | build a relationship with the gardeners. By the same token the educators
              | learned to respect the young adults’ own ability to take initiative:
              | I would say [to the youth], ‘Do you want me to go over to the gardener
              | with you? Do you want me to do anything or just be here?’ They’d say,
              | 216 Julia Preece
              | ‘No, just be here,’ and they’d come back and I’d let them tell me how it
              | went. …(Educator, Philadelphia) (Doyle/Krasny 2003: 97)
              | The activities also generated insights about people and emotions associated
              | with gardening, as well as sustainability issues and the contribution the prod-
              | ucts made to the community. From the gardeners’ perspectives the interac-
              | tions enhanced their own self respect and feeling of belonging (Doyle/Krasny
              | 2003: 104).
              | Commentary
              | Reflections on the total action research process highlighted the difficulties in
              | balancing a complex set of research, education and community action objec-
              | tives. It was felt that the educational outcomes were achieved more success-
              | fully than research outcomes, with consequences for sustainable action.
              | Equally the ‘total participation’ of youth and gardeners in determining objec-
              | tives and devising research questions was subliminated by the educators’
              | overall control of the whole process, although youth were encouraged to add
              | research questions of their own. The gardeners themselves were confused
              | about their role in the exercise, sometimes believing they were teachers rather
              | than participants in a shared objective. The youths’ own communication and
              | academic skills varied, with consequent outcomes for their engagement in all
              | the activities. A general observation was that all participants needed longer
              | preparation time to fully understand the PRA process.
              | This was a complex and ambitious arrangement that made genuine at-
              | tempts to involve people who would not normally have a voice in their own
              | community. It perhaps lacked direction in that the objectives for change were
              | not clear, and the mutual roles of each layer of participant were not always
              | understood. Perhaps the greatest gain – as for the World Bank study – was in
              | the breaking down of misconceptions and inter-generational stereotype ex-
              | pectations of each other.
              | 6. Lessons to be learned?
              | A number of observations can be made concerning the relevance of literature
              | arguments about Participatory appraisal in analysing these two case studies.
              | Participatory Rural Appraisal 217
              | On the plus side the above cases demonstrate the versatility of the partici-
              | patory approach to a variety of situations around the world. The distinctive-
              | ness of participatory rural appraisal – or participatory appraisal (PA) as it is
              | now coming to be known – originated as a methodology that was applied to
              | rural communities where literacy levels were low and were people felt re-
              | moved from public decision making processes. These issues can be applied
              | globally to marginalised groups and people whose levels of literacy, or
              | knowledge of technical language, is less than that of people making decisions
              | that affect their lives. PA not only broadens the range of strategies available
              | to low literacy groups. It can also be effective in community mobilisation.
              | The studies demonstrated the opportunity for data collection partnerships that
              | would not otherwise have existed and created new dynamics between the re-
              | searchers and participants. As a result of these opportunities and dynamics,
              | knowledge was secured that would otherwise have been hidden (for example,
              | the extent to which community members in the African context use tradi-
              | tional healers in relation to conventional medical resources). New knowledge
              | often then emerges as a re-working of solutions that are context sensitive.
              | The outcomes should not be overstated, but methods can be used to provide
              | innovative ways of engaging with marginalised social groups, and adapted to
              | suit particular circumstances. In addition to the above examples it has been
              | used in situations that can range from health care situations (Gray et al 2000),
              | to team building (Michaels et al 2001).
              | However, there are some pervading issues. For instance, another continu-
              | ing distinctiveness of participatory appraisal from other forms of participa-
              | tory research perhaps lies in the criticism that it is under-theorised. Therein
              | lies the rub. A more theoretical approach (perhaps using Third World Femi-
              | nisms or post colonial analysis as a framework) might give the methodology
              | academic credibility within institutions. Consequently, its strength as a user-
              | friendly signifier of research that de-mystifies its language and accessibility
              | to marginalised research participants might be compromised and challenge
              | the overall purpose of retaining knowledge within the community. Another
              | weakness of many participatory appraisals is not so much the collection or re-
              | liability of data, but the effectiveness of subsequent action plans. Perhaps a
              | way forward would be to persuade funding sources to support research pro-
              | 218 Julia Preece
              | grammes that allowed for more deliberative community engagement over
              | longer periods of time to enable communities themselves to critique, rather
              | than simply participate in, participatory research.
              | Both cases also highlight that the situation to be changed is rarely identi-
              | fied by the target participants. It is the external agent who stimulates the ex-
              | ploration of the issue and the participants contribute to identifying the com-
              | plexity or detail of the issue or problem situation. Therefore, the extent to
              | which participatory appraisal is a truly grass roots led process is entirely de-
              | pendent on how flexible the researchers are prepared to be regarding research
              | outcomes. In the World Bank study for instance, the target issue of
              | HIV/AIDS was not a priority for the participant communities. It is question-
              | able, therefore, what sustainable outcomes would have been achieved from
              | the community perspectives, since funding would have been linked to an
              | agenda for HIV/AIDS change strategies alone. In the urban garden project
              | follow up action did ensue, but it was not necessarily action for change and it
              | was not clear whether any such action had been prioritised.
              | An overall criticism of the quality of, and suitability of, data gathering
              | techniques lies, arguably, not just in the newness of those techniques but also
              | in the quality of facilitation training. The case studies cited above seem to
              | share the need for facilitation skills that derive from good adult education
              | practice. So participatory appraisal methodologies require a combination of
              | pedagogical and cultural sensitivity skills that stretch beyond those normally
              | required of a lone researcher who may be more practised at moving into a re-
              | search environment, collecting data and then moving back out to analyse it
              | independently. Whilst methods are adaptable, there is sometimes an apparent
              | mismatch between the researcher-facilitator’s skills and the participants’
              | skills and understanding. Again time and flexibility need to accommodate
              | these concerns.
              | Other criticisms of PA’s credibility as a research approach must also take
              | into account that no research is value free. Participatory research is not de-
              | signed to produce a universal truth but it does aim to produce something
              | valuable for the participants. Action research is centred around engaging
              | people in a critique of their present situation to improve practice for the fu-
              | ture. Both case studies were attempting to contribute to the quality of life of
              | Participatory Rural Appraisal 219
              | poor communities. The impact on sustainable development and poverty re-
              | duction will depend to what extent the outcomes can move us towards that
              | goal. In view of the fact that poverty is multi dimensional and multi-
              | directional (Eversole/Routh 2005) it would seem important to operationlise
              | the findings at several levels. As researchers we also have a responsibility to
              | reach as large an audience as possible. So whilst we may be furthering our
              | own careers in the dissemination process we can do so ethically – by using
              | data that draws on community voices but also presents that data in a form that
              | will be accepted by those wider structures in society that continue to provide
              | marginalising infrastructures, legislation and attitudinal barriers. At the same
              | time the process needs to give local people the skills, understanding and
              | knowledge to raise their own voices. Our ethical responsibility is in respect-
              | ing difference, being open about power differentials but trying to avoid ex-
              | ploitation of these differences in a way that will undermine the very people
              | we are trying to help. It is the purpose (participation at all stages with a view
              | to local empowerment) that should be the focus, and attention to ethical re-
              | sponsibilities (a commitment to methods that are appropriate for purpose, a
              | willingness to listen and recognise local indigenous strengths and abilities)
              | that will achieve new knowledge production and political will (letting go con-
              | trol) that can, in turn, enable grass roots led action for change, but perhaps as
              | a longer term strategy than PA alone can allow.
              | We must be realistic, however. It is highly unlikely that participatory or
              | any other engagement with human beings will produce consensus within any
              | community of different voices. Perhaps the best we can hope for is to start a
              | process of deepening understanding and allow the natural course of events to
              | slowly drip feed into an improvement in sensitivities and recognition of the
              | positive elements of this kind of research. The process, however, has to be
              | linked to wider development initiatives that can build on what PA has started.
              | This, then, is the final justification for participatory appraisal. If participa-
              | tory methodologies provide access to data that is otherwise unavailable, then
              | it has a part to play in filling the gap in knowledge about disempowerment
              | and poverty production from the perspectives of the least empowered in soci-
              | ety. This holds true for all countries in the world.
