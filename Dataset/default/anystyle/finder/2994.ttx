              | Abstract: After asking what is typical or general in the life
              | history of Hülya as a migrant worker in Germany and what
              | is exceptional or unique (Section 1) the biographical proc-
              | esses of her life history up to the most central episodes of
              | her conventional and estranging pre-arranged marriage and
              | her way out of it through divorce after having stayed in
              | Germany for several years will be delineated (Section 2).
              | Before reaching this turning point Hülya not only undergoes
              | the “common” type trajectory of a migrant worker—the tra-
              | jectory of being a cultural stranger, of being void of lan-
              | guage, of being exploited by hardest sorts of work—, but, in
              | addition, her personal biographical development is retarded
              | by the exceptional, but probably not totally untypical ex-
              | perience of being trapped within a situation of compulsory
              | labour (resembling slave labour). For a long time she also
              | feels obliged to remain in her trajectory position of an iso-
              | lated migrant worker, since originally she had mainly meant
              | to go to Germany in order to support her poverty stricken

              | the fear that she will get self-alienated and “petrified” like
              | the older women with whom she dwells and works together
              | Hülya accepts a pre-arranged marriage (probably mainly
              | negotiated by her mother) as the only way out of her pre-
              | dicament. But willy-nilly Hülya must learn that she—alrea-
              | dy embarked on her way to an individualized and emanci-
              | pated existence—cannot live in such a superimposed
              | arrangement, and therefore she distances herself from her
              | husband through the biographical escape action schemes

              | 1. Introduction: Common and Unique Features of Hülya’s
              | Life History
              | -
              | The interview with Hülya shows numerous aspects of life histories of Turkish
              | migrant workers coming to Germany, which we consider as typical for the
              | organised work migration to Germany in the sixties and early seventies. But it
              | also shows features, which are unique and outstanding. Common structural
              | features are, for example, the institutional processing of the workers by the
              | recruiting, examination and selection strategies in Turkey and the intake and
              | exploitation strategies by German firms (in Germany). Of course, all of these
              | structural features are connected with deep experiences of extended suffering:
              | of being dehumanised by the selection and intake procedures; of being alien-
              | ated by not understanding the language and culture of Germany; of being her-
              | metically isolated; of being the despicable marginalized stranger, who doesn’t
              | understand anything of importance to Germans; of being emotionally and mor-
              | ally disoriented by being a cultural hybrid; of doing hard industrial work which
              | one is not used to yet; of feeling estranged from oneself; of getting sick by
              | exhaustion; etc.—But there are some other features in the interview with Hülya
              | that are not as common as the just mentioned features. These other features
              | include:
              | -
              | Hülya comes to Germany in 1972, when she is extremely young (she
              | just turns 17 years old, and she still is almost a child at the time of her
              | arrival);
              | Hülya is a young woman, who migrates to Germany all by herself; and
              | she continues to stay alone as a marginalized person during the entire
              | fourteen-year period of her work and residence in Germany up to the
              | time of the interview;
meta          | 108
text          | - for one year—i.e., in her first year in Germany, when she is on contract
              | work in a slaughter house for chicken—her work reveals not just the
              | normal type of exploitation and estrangement features of the underpri-
              | vileged migrant worker’s occupational situation in general, but, in
              | addition, the features of compulsory work as typical for concentration
              | camp or slave labour organisations. This might be closely connected to
              | her biographical condition of being an inexperienced, shy and very
              | young woman, who does not speak the language and from whom, there-
              | fore, the employer and his plant organisation do not expect any type of
              | systematic resistance;
              | - nevertheless: during her long stay in Germany, Hülya emancipates her-
              | self from her rural family background and dares to speak for herself and
              | thereby overcomes a disastrous biographical crisis situation; she ac-
              | quires an emancipated and individualized personal identity;
              | - but most important is the following extraordinary feature: Hülya’s in-
              | tention to come to Germany is linked to an unbearable material con-
              | dition in which her family lives. She attempts to free her family from
              | the burden to care for her as the dependent youngest daughter, and, in
              | addition, she even intends to help her mother, father, and siblings—in
              | so far as they are still dependent—out of their poverty-related
              | predicament and of humiliating dependence on her oldest brother (who
              | took over the family household) by earning enough money in Germany
              | to support the family.
              | Putting the common and the unique features of the life history of Hülya to-
              | gether: Hülya develops an attitude regarding the course of her marginalisation
              | and cultural hybridisation, which shows many features of productive individu-
              | alisation. The question is how Hülya would acquire her remarkable competen-
              | cies for individualizing biographical work taking into regard all the disastrous
              | difficulties of her life history.
              | 2. Biographical Processes in the Life History of Hülya.
              | Biographical Processes up to the Life Episodes of a Pre-
              | arranged Marriage and the Way out of it Through Divorce
              | In order to understand the mixture of uniqueness and common features in
              | Hülya’s life history that is mainly patterned by her work migration to Germany,
              | it is necessary to briefly recapitulate the biographical processes and the most
              | important phases of these biographical processes in her life history. This short-
              | ened version of her biography is methodically grounded on the analytical pro-
              | cedures of text sort analysis, structural description, and analytical abstraction
              | (SCHÜTZE 1983, 1984). Text sort analysis looks at the features of ongoing
meta          | 109
text          | interaction in the interview situation and at the differential involvement of the
              | communicative schemes of narration, description and argumentation in the
              | informant’s follow-up of the line of rendering of her or his personal experi-
              | ences. Of particular interest in this stage of analysis are background construc-
              | tions (SCHÜTZE 1992, 2001a), which deal with disorderly chunks of bio-
              | graphical experience, and argumentative commentaries (SCHÜTZE 1987,
              | 1991a), which express biographical work of the informant. Structural descrip-
              | tion is the analytical procedure, by which the unfolding of the story telling in
              | its formal textual features is articulated1 and at the same time the unfolding of
              | biographical processes is sequentially followed up and delineated (SCHÜTZE
              | 1981, 1984, 1991, 1994, 1995, 2001b). Most important is the analytical activity
              | of “pragmatic breaching”, which envisions the formal and substantive features
              | of the autobiographical text as expressions of a recapitulation of re-enacting or
              | even “re-enlivening” (formerly) evolving biographical process structures that
              | the informant has been involved in. One basic step in the analytical abstraction
              | is the integrated follow-up of the sequential order and/or simultaneous conflict
              | of the supra-segmental units of the narrative text; these lump together narrative
              | units into integrated biographical contexts that reveal stretched-out biographi-
              | cal process structures. The aim is to reach an empirically grounded concept of
              | the overall biographical structuring of the whole life history as told in the auto-
              | biographical narrative interview (SCHÜTZE 1981, 1991, 1994, 2001a). In this
              | following article a full application of the analytical apparatus cannot be articu-
              | lated. However, I articulate my understanding of the overall biographical struc-
              | turing of Hülya’s life history by lumping together the narrative units of Hülya’s
              | narrative. I use the supra-segmental sequential organization of Hülya’s overall
              | autobiographical narrative as a guide. But this is only possible on the base of a
              | meticulous segmentation of the entire text into local narrative units or it would
              | be impossible to differentiate between segmental und supra-segmental units. In
              | addition, it would be impossible to appreciate the vague or even “oblique”
              | ways of textual rendering of disorderly and hurting experiences, which she
              | specifically expressed through background constructions dealing with her pre-
              | arranged marriage and her divorce.
              | 2.1. The family trap (ll.122-154)
              | In the beginning of Hülya’s life history there is her family’s collective trajec-
              | tory of being unable to autonomously support itself. Hülya’s parents do not
              | have the capacity to give a proper education to three of five children, still de-
              | 1 These include narrative units, sub-segmental phenomena (like background constructions
              | and descriptive detailing) and supra-segmental meta-units of sequential biographical con-
              | texts dealing with biographical process structures (like biographical action schemes, bio-
              | graphical trajectories of suffering, biographical processes of identity metamorphosis and the
              | pursuit of institutional expectation patterns of the life course).
meta          | 110
text          | pendent on their support. Hülya’s father became severely ill, fell into unem-
              | ployment, and has not worked since. He was not able to uphold his own house-
              | hold, because he did not have health or invalidity insurance. Instead, the oldest
              | son took over, and he now controls the household budget covering all depend-
              | ant family members (including his father and mother). This might be a typical
              | intergenerational relationship in a rural society with patrilocal succession
              | (which goes back to ancient times). The oldest daughter is an exception to the
              | difficult situation in which other family members live: she married a well-to-do
              | farmer. Hülya’s family including herself took the opportunity to work on the
              | farm of the rich son in law during the summer season of harvest.
              | The absence of the household autonomy of Hülya’s inner family means hu-
              | miliation for her father, mother, the bright youngest brother (who cannot go to
              | university), and herself. Hülya cannot get a vocational training, although she
              | has been successful in school. And nobody seems to be concerned about it—
              | contrary to the concern about the educational situation of her youngest brother.
              | Hülya is apparently expected to become a traditional housewife. (Later we
              | learn that Hülya’s father might possibly have had different ideas, but he had
              | been removed from his former authority position as head of the family—
              | ll.1074-1077.) In the early days of her life Hülya identifies intensely with her
              | mother, who cannot reign her own household and, hence, is unable to function
              | properly as a traditional housewife and mother. She suffers a lot and seems to
              | be emotionally quite unstable. Hülya doesn’t see any future perspective for her
              | mother, for her father, for her brother and for herself. She witnesses the mal-
              | functioning or even deterioration of the traditional rural family system in Tur-
              | key. It does not fit the modern requirements for the development of autono-
              | mous, individualized biographical identities which Hülya is oriented to; her
              | father’s advice probably plays an important role in this context. Taking into
              | account the absence of a protecting health and unemployment insurance sys-
              | tem, one realises that no welfare state or civil society serves as a substitute for
              | the lack of protection and social solidarity meant to derive from the traditional
              | Turkish rural family system. This explains Hülya’s subsequent high apprecia-
              | tion for the German system of social security produced and permanently upheld
              | by state and cooperative institutions.
              | 2.2. Hülya’s biographical action scheme of work migration and
              | of supporting her family through it (ll.156-195)
              | Hülya develops the plan not only to escape from the family trajectory of heter-
              | onomous determination, of being dependent on the (probably not freely given)
              | support of her very controlling oldest brother, of the humiliation of her parents
              | and herself and of not having any developmental personal future for the family
              | members and herself, but also to rescue her family from its predicament. Hav-
              | ing seen Turkish guest workers in the neighbourhood coming back from West-
meta          | 111
text          | ern Germany during vacation times, who seem to be affluent in their life style
              | (ll.145-146), Hülya at first fantasizes about and then plans to embark on a
              | labour migration to West Germany as soon as possible. Her fantasies can in
              | part be ascribed to having been misled by the show-off displayed by migrant
              | workers having come home; here we therefore have the opportunity to study
              | the power of “pull” mechanisms of labour migration.
              | There are two features of Hülya’s action plan to go to West Germany as a
              | guest worker, which seem to be special. First, Hülya is the youngest child of
              | the family and it can legitimately be asked, why is she the only member of the
              | inner family who develops and pursues the plan to rescue the family through
              | labour migration? Being very young and female she seems to be the least fit
              | family member for this type of rescue action—to be accomplished through hard
              | corporeal work, which is associated with cultural alienation and social isola-
              | tion. Second, although Hülya painstakingly attempts to give the impression that
              | her family—especially her father and her mother—does not like to send her
              | abroad, it is her father, who finally assists in the legal procedure of “making her
              | younger” to the effect that she can apply in advance to the administrative guest
              | worker program. One of her brothers—probably the eldest brother as head of
              | the family—accompanies her to Istanbul, the location of the selection process
              | in the administrative recruitment procedure for getting promising (healthy,
              | bright, well educated, hard working) guest workers. He obviously is not only
              | her protector and emotional supporter, but also controls her pursuit of labour
              | migration. For example, he harshly criticizes her when she reacts with panic at
              | the long needles used for drawing blood for the compulsory blood tests.
              | One gets the impression that it is not just Hülya, who pushes through her
              | biographical action scheme, but also that the family is indeed quite suppor-
              | tive—perhaps even pushy—regarding her pursuit and realisation of the plan.
              | Though being the youngest child, she appears to be the least embedded and
              | least rooted within the family structure and social structure of rural Turkey; she
              | therefore is the one most “available” for uprooting and migration to Germany
              | (from where she serves as the supporter of the family from afar). In addition, as
              | the youngest child she can least be helped in getting a good education and a
              | proper vocational training at a time when the material position of the family
              | continuously deteriorates.
              | 2.3. The intake procedure for guest workers that Hülya is
              | encountering (ll.197-258)
              | Hülya undergoes the institutional procedure of being tested, examined and
              | selected for “guest work” in Germany. This procedure resembles the intake
              | procedure of being drafted into, or incorporated within, an army—especially
              | taking into account the medical examinations and mental ability tests adminis-
              | tered to the applicants. But it also shows some additional features of checking
meta          | 112
text          | and scrutinizing that are harsher than any army intake procedure: scrutiny
              | resembling that given a horse or slave to be sold. In addition, a phase for the
              | presentation of the work to be done in Germany and for the signing of the
              | contract is built into the institutional selection procedure for guest workers, for
              | example, for activities of advertising and of formal contract reciprocity.
              | The selection and contract procedures are formally controlled by the na-
              | tional Turkish work administration agency. But they seem to be more effec-
              | tively moulded by the interests and interventions of German firms that plan to
              | hire Turkish personnel. Two facts reveal the low efficacy of official Turkish
              | control during the intake procedure and later on (when Hülya has worked in
              | Germany for some time). First, Hülya had just turned seventeen when she
              | underwent the selection and intake procedure and her age is not checked care-
              | fully. Second, the Turkish labour administration agent visiting Hülya’s firm
              | (ll.390-409) does not—unlike Gogol’s “auditor”—seem to do autonomous
              | checks of the circumstances under which the Turkish labourers work and live.
              | He obviously does not check if somebody of the Turkish work personnel is
              | actually missing—in this case Hülya, who is severely ill at the time (due to an
              | accident at work) and has been hidden from his eyes by being placed in a wait-
              | ing room for a whole day with the false announcement that she was seeing the
              | physician.
              | Generally speaking, a systematic collusion between the public Turkish la-
              | bour agency and exploitative German firms apparently had been established to
              | the disadvantage and detriment of the selected and hired guest workers.
              | 2.4. The biographical trajectory of compulsory labour
              | (ll.260-409)
              | During her first year in Germany, Hülya is trapped within the dynamics of a
              | prisoner’s or slave worker’s trajectory of confinement and forced labour. When
              | Hülya arrives at Germany, she experiences not only the normal type of immi-
              | gration trajectory (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE 1991) but also the much harsher
              | ones of confinement and compulsory labour.
              | In Hülya’s case, the normal type of an immigrant’s trajectory means that for
              | a certain while she would not be able to proceed under the auspices of her
              | biographical action scheme of labour migration—earning surplus money in
              | support of her family back home in Turkey. Or more generally speaking, in the
              | course of a normal immigration trajectory expectation patterns—following up
              | the action scheme of establishing oneself within the new life situation in a
              | circumspect way, earning “real money”, and improving by this one’s own
              | material life situation—are impaired or even eliminated for a while. This is so,
              | since everything within the new life situation turns out to be different from how
              | it had been expected prior to the journey and immigration. The experience of
              | being culturally and socially strange to the new life situation, that is, of having
meta          | 113
text          | to live and proceed under conditions that are unknown, would for a while
              | overwhelm and impair the immigrant’s capacity to follow up her or his own
              | line of intentions and orientations by circumspect action. For a while, the im-
              | migrant would only be able to react to the overpowering conditions of the
              | strange, very urging new life predicament. For example, she or he would be
              | forced to follow up the conditional relevancies of the new situation with its
              | unexpected necessities. At the same time the immigrant would also be isolated
              | socially. Especially due to the language barrier, she or he would not be able to
              | communicate with others and would feel alone. In addition, she or he would be
              | disoriented by the falsification of her or his own cultural and social expectation
              | patterns brought into the new cultural and social situation (SCHÜTZ 1964a).
              | The immigrant would feel self-alienated by her or his incapacity to follow up
              | former intentions.
              | Then, in the course of the normal type of immigration trajectory, the immi-
              | grant would need some time to learn the ropes of the new social and cultural
              | situation—acquiring the language, managing to get in contact with others,
              | communicating with them, and understanding the regulations, conditions and
              | action possibilities of the new life and labour situation. All of this would be
              | quite difficult initially. But after some time, the immigrant would be able to re-
              | cover her or his own action capacities for following up the old overall action
              | scheme of earning surplus money and to improve her situation. For example,
              | Hülya could really start to support her family in Turkey, and in addition to this
              | she could develop a new biographical action scheme (e.g., to establish her own
              | autonomous existence in Germany). Of course, to a certain extent, she would
              | remain a cultural stranger. She still would compare her old cultural expecta-
              | tions with the new cultural orientations that she has learned in between
              | (SCHÜTZ 1964a, 1964b). But as such an “enculturated” stranger she surely
              | would be able to act autonomously again. In addition, as a cultural hybrid
              | (BHABHA 1994) she increasingly would envision certain opportunities for
              | orientation, reflection, deliberation and action that are not open to autochtho-
              | nous members of the immigrant receiving German society. On the other hand,
              | she would still suffer from being positioned between the two cultures and so-
              | cietal bodies as a marginal personality (STONEQUIST 1961).
              | As mentioned above, Hülya’s new predicament of confinement and compul-
              | sory labour is more severe than the normal type of life situation of an immi-
              | grant. She gets deprived of her passport by having it stored in the administra-
              | tion bureau of the recruitment firm, and she does not receive a permit of
              | residence for the whole time span of her work in the firm; her permit of resi-
              | dence does not include the five days of extra work which are required from her
              | after the expiry of her contract and she is not aware of the specific legal re-
              | quirements, she only learns about them later on. The firm does not explain to
              | the newly recruited foreign workers what their civil liberties and work rights
              | are, and nobody else—for example, the Turkish labour administration or Ger-
meta          | 114
text          | man institutions such as the German labour administration, German unions,
              | controlling public bodies (e.g., the Gewerbeaufsichtsämter) or representatives
              | of the German employer organisations (like the Industrie- und Handelskam-
              | mer)—does this either. Hülya insinuates—and she seems to be correctly as-
              | suming—that the firm deliberately takes advantages of the ignorance of the
              | newly recruited workers, since after the year of official contract nobody likes to
              | stay in the firm, and, instead of this, the firm recruits new personnel in Turkey
              | that too is exploited and systematically deprived of its work rights and civil
              | liberties. The firm does not proceed legally, but it is remarkable that it can
              | enact these practices in such a systematic and effective manner. Striking struc-
              | tural similarities exist to slave labour in Nazi firms and concentration camps2
              | or—maybe this comes closer—to prostitution into which unsuspecting young
              | women from Eastern Europe have been trapped who are lured and often “im-
              | ported” to Western Europe.
              | Hülya has to live in a small room with four others young women in some
              | sort of army barracks situation. She has to work from six o’clock in the morn-
              | ing to ten o’clock at night: in addition to her normal work at the chicken
              | slaughter house assembly line, she cleans the workplace together with three
              | other women without receiving any substantial payment. The safety regulations
              | in the factory are poorly enforced. Hülya gets injured twice, and her medical
              | predicament is exacerbated by the negligence of the factory physician. In both
              | 2 It might be seen as an exaggeration to state structural similarities between compulsory
              | labour in a concentration camp and Hülya’s overload of work in the slaughterhouse for
              | chicken. One could argue, that Hülya always had the legal right to quit her work contract
              | and to work somewhere else or—at least—to return to Turkey without a proper annulment
              | of the contract. And in fact, by physical force nobody endangered Hülya’s life at all.—But
              | on the other hand, decisive is the fact, that Hülya did not know about such alternatives. She
              | mistakenly assumed that she was forced to remain in her work position in the slaughter-
              | house for chicken and, in addition, that she had to carry her overwhelming burden of work.
              | The management of the slaughterhouse systematically reckoned with the ignorance of the
              | newly recruited workers and was, thus, able to organize a hermetically closed system of
              | exploitation of its neophytes. In addition, there seemed to be at least some bit of vague col-
              | lusion of German state institutions, public agencies and professional bodies with the man-
              | agement of the slaughterhouse: the union, the agency for factory safety and health control,
              | the governmental job centre, the chamber of industry and commerce, the local medical doc-
              | tors and local hospitals tended to look away, to circumvent the ominous establishment, to
              | keep quiet and to leave the inmates in all their ignorance about their work rights, health
              | rights and human rights in general. Although this collusion of German official institutions,
              | bodies and professional actors was vague, it was—in fact, on a quite systematic scale—
              | morally irresponsible nevertheless. (In this regard Hülya is especially critical about the lo-
              | cal union; see ll.421-422.) Hülya was not forced through physical violence to do all the ex-
              | tra work—and at least formally she probably even got some extra pay for it, although it
              | was, then, factually reduced from her regular pay again. But she was systematically ma-
              | nipulated to mistakenly assume that there was no alternative from doing that extra work. In
              | exactly this sense she was forced to do the extra work; and in this sense, too, the manage-
              | ment of the slaughterhouse had successfully set up a modern organisational arrangement for
              | compulsory work: it accomplished it through a cunning strategy of making use of the igno-
              | rance of its dependants from foreign countries.
meta          | 115
text          | cases of accident Hülya does not receive proper treatment and is forced by the
              | factory physician or the shop steward to work until late at the night. The man-
              | agement of the firm knows that the treatment by the factory physician is inade-
              | quate: it would not have hidden the injured and ailing Hülya from the eyes of
              | the Turkish labour administration inspector.
              | Hülya assumes to be forced to stay in the slaughterhouse for the first year in
              | Germany. She does not have her passport. She is in debt to the firm, since it
              | issued her an advance payment to her at the beginning of the contract. Hülya
              | thinks that there is no legal escape from the contract and that it is totally impos-
              | sible to change from one firm to the other during the first year, the contract
              | year, as guest worker in Germany. (The slaughterhouse officials do not correct
              | this assumption when they refuse a slightly premature ending of the one-year
              | contract.) It is a nightmare for Hülya to imagine the “worst case scenario”:
              | being forced to go home without ending the contract and returning to Turkey as
              | a failure. (The company probably knows that its Turkish employees do not see
              | a feasible escape from the situation by returning home to Turkey. Pride, self
              | esteem, reputation and the moral state of being righteous would be overwhelm-
              | ingly at stake.)
              | The compulsory work situation has three features of biographical impact.
              | First, it isolates the persons in the same predicament from each other. At the
              | beginning of Hülya’s stay there is no solidarity of mutual help and consolation
              | between the newcomers and the other dormitory dwellers and co-workers.
              | Second, it is a life and work situation of extreme humiliation: Hülya knows
              | about her exploitation—too much and too hard work and far too little pay—but
              | she cannot change it. Her central biographical problem is to be forced into a
              | situation that is unjust and unfair. Moreover, her situation makes little sense
              | with respect to her former biographical action scheme of supporting her family
              | in Turkey. She realises that her suffering is not only an everyday burden, but
              | also does not matter in terms of future biographical developments and perspec-
              | tives. Hülya feels and fears to be seen as a grumbler after she has been injured
              | by the two work accidents and complaining about them and the pain involved.
              | Her me-images (MEAD 1934) are impaired. She would like to be seen as a
              | hard efficient worker and she feels to be approached like a malingerer. Third,
              | Hülya is forced to postpone learning German and being socialized into German
              | culture, because there is no chance of having private social contacts with Ger-
              | mans (even buying groceries is difficult, since she has to work from 6 to 22
              | o’clock). There is no time and little energy left to attend any type of language
              | lessons. (It is remarkable that neither the employer nor the labour administra-
              | tion or the union provide related opportunities or support.) In addition, there
              | might be an emotional barrier to learn the language and culture of a society in
              | which such a despicable systematic work situation of unfairness, loss of bio-
              | graphical sense, and personal humiliation is possible. It is remarkable that
              | Hülya learns German and gets into German culture only eight years later, when
meta          | 116
text          | she seriously considers building a life in Germany rather than in Turkey and
              | after going through a pre-arranged marriage and her divorce. The delay of
              | learning German and getting involved in German culture might be due not only
              | to a lack of opportunity but also to a systematic attitude acquired in this early
              | occupational “hell” of enforced, exploiting and isolating work. This means that
              | work arrangements do not always have a socializing impact on acquiring the
              | competence to do collective identity work (dealing with the neighbourhood,
              | with networks of acquaintances, friends and voluntary associations, with the
              | cultural region, with Germany and Turkey as nation states and their productive
              | relationship to each other, with civil society and the welfare state, with public
              | discourse arenas, with Europe and the universal world society as frames of
              | moral and political orientation). The contrary can also be true. If work situa-
              | tions are experienced as disastrous, they can retard the biographical develop-
              | ment of competencies for collective identity work (including learning pertinent
              | languages).
              | 2.5. Liberation from the compulsory labour trajectory
              | (ll.411-475)
              | Nearly at the end of her first year of contract work, Hülya is visited by remote
              | relatives living in Hamburg, who have been asked by her own inner family to
              | look after Hülya. In this concern of her own inner family, especially her par-
              | ents, might be implied their consideration of how Hülya would be able to find
              | another job at all, since an extension of her first job contract seems to be un-
              | bearable for her and should be avoided by all means. (However, Hülya does not
              | consider this question as the implied intention of her inner family in turning for
              | help to their remote relatives in Hamburg.) The remote relatives from Hamburg
              | immediately realise how deplorable and despicable Hülya’s present work situa-
              | tion really is. They attempt to immediately take her with them. But the factory
              | management insists that Hülya would have to fulfil her contract up to the last
              | day; it even requires Hülya to work five days longer than that stipulated in the
              | contract, since her actual employment after coming to Germany started only
              | five days after her arrival at the factory location. These five days are actually
              | quite important in legal terms, because for them Hülya and her roommates
              | don’t have a permit of residence, since the one year permit expired five days
              | earlier. By accident the brother of one of the roommates realises the lack of a
              | valid permit of residence for the five young women, including Hülya, when he
              | attempts to take his own sister with him to his place of residence. (Not having a
              | valid permit of residence at one’s disposal would mean the danger of being
              | extradited immediately when checked by the police by chance or when getting
              | into contact with the governmental work administration or with other possible
              | employers.) The circumspect brother of Hülya’s roommate can manage to get a
              | hearing for the five young women with an understanding and professional
meta          | 117
text          | agent of the governmental work administration in a neighbouring city. This is
              | the first German state representative mentioned by Hülya who fulfils his civil
              | servant duty by professionally criticising and controlling the dehumanising
              | work exploitation practices that are illegally imposed on guest workers. He
              | checks the legal status of the five young women for their entitlement to work in
              | their former firm of employment and the lack of correct administrative prac-
              | tices of its management to deal with that legal entitlement and the occupational
              | and civil rights implied in it in a direct phone communication with the firm
              | management. He criticises the disgusting administrative and legal performance
              | of the firm management right away and outspokenly. And then, without any
              | bureaucratic delay, he issues the permits of residence to the five young women.
              | In the course of her liberation from the former compulsory work situation,
              | Hülya also becomes aware of the social base of sisterly solidarity and mutual
              | love between her and the other four roommates who now have to part from
              | each other. Only now, in retrospect, she can understand and appreciate the
              | mutual emotional support and practical help of her and her roommates for each
              | other as an important experience in her life. Only now she realises the value of
              | friendships apart from the family. This is in contrast to the solidarity platform
              | of the traditional Turkish family, which step by step deteriorates under the
              | impact of societal modernization, or at least does not produce biographical wel-
              | fare to its individual members. This realisation of the value of private friend-
              | ship is an important early step of biographical work that Hülya, in the follow-
              | ing years, will do so impressively. Hülya now notices that a network of private
              | friends is extremely important in a situation of isolated life as a migrant worker
              | separated from her own family of origin. Hülya starts to understand—and later
              | on she realises even more closely (see, e.g., the coda part of Hülya’s autobio-
              | graphical narrative of the main story part of the interview on ll.857-861)—that
              | in the future the networks of private, individualised friendship might become a
              | new platform of social solidarity in life situations of social isolation and indi-
              | vidualisation. This new solidarity platform might substitute for a malfunction-
              | ing or even deteriorated platform of solidarity provided by the traditional rural
              | family in Turkey. (In her biographical insight, Hülya’s deliberation resembles
              | the analytical assessments of the early Chicago sociologist of the impact of
              | rapid modernisation, especially industrialisation and metropolisation, on the
              | biography constructions, social relationships and solidarity bases of modern
              | men and women, especially on work migrants and immigrants with their “mar-
              | ginal personalities” [THOMAS & ZNANIECKI 1927, PARK 1967, STONE-
              | QUIST 1961]).
              | With the help of her remote relatives from Hamburg Hülya gets a work posi-
              | tion in a metal processing firm in a small town near Hamburg. This might not
              | be the work she would have liked most. (First, the remote relatives tried to get
              | her into a big hospital as a nurse assistant or cleaning woman, but she was not
              | accepted.) But looking at her formulations in the text of her autobiographical
meta          | 118
text          | rendering (e.g., ll.819-823) it becomes clear that Hülya develops a biographical
              | identification with hard industrial work she would like to do with circumspec-
              | tion, effectiveness, trustworthiness, dependability and biographical pride—very
              | much similar to the value features Max WEBER (1988) has conceptually con-
              | nected to the orientation pattern and cultural tradition of the protestant work
              | ethic. Probably Hülya does not like to be conditioned by a network of social
              | relationships that may be difficult to handle in her own family of origin. In-
              | stead, the industrial work situation can be handled without much complicated
              | communication and negotiation.
              | Having been rescued from the life and work situation of compulsory work,
              | Hülya intensely expects from the future to find situations that she can shape
              | herself and that allow her to have some biographical rest to start learning to live
              | in Germany. Not to find such a new life situation would be extremely disap-
              | pointing to her. After a first step of biographical work she seems to be ready for
              | a biographical metamorphosis (SCHÜTZE, 1991, 1994) of education, learning,
              | acquiring new cultural orientations, i.e. she yearns to leave behind the depres-
              | sive predicament of a self-alienating trajectory experience, of being the igno-
              | rant cultural stranger and of being forced into a exploitative compulsory work
              | trajectory.
              | 2.6. Intensification of the biographical experience of suffering in
              | a self alienating trajectory of work exploitation (ll.480-544)
              | Contrary to her own biographical expectation, the trajectory experience of
              | extreme work exploitation does not vanish when Hülya enters the metal pack-
              | aging and metal processing firm. This amounts to a very complicated bio-
              | graphical problem constellation, since Hülya has allowed herself to open up to
              | new hope because she could finally manage to escape from the forceful trap of
              | compulsory extra labour in the slaughterhouse for chicken. Now, in contrast to
              | the experience of this extraordinary form of exploitation, Hülya must encounter
              | the “normal type” of a biographical trajectory of occupational exploitation of
              | migrant workers in Germany. She has to do hard bodily work and gets a typical
              | disease from it: tendovaginitis and the swelling of her operating arm, through
              | which she pursues her industrial work tasks. (She has to continually push heavy
              | levers for closing the lids of tin cans.) After two years of this extremely strenu-
              | ous work she has to change her work place in order to avoid having her work
              | disease become chronic and to escape from this mechanism of corporeal trans-
              | formation of her entrapment predicament of exploitation trajectory. But—as
              | typical for the fateful mechanisms of a full-blown trajectory dynamics—she
              | falls out of the frying pan into the fire, i.e. she has now to lift roughly 800
              | cardboards a day onto pallets. The total exhaustion of her body partially condi-
              | tioned by this causes Hülya to become dangerously underweight, although a
              | mental state of depression is also part of the structural conditions for her weight
meta          | 119
text          | loss. The latter of course is a second phenomenon of corporeal transformation
              | of the work exploitation trajectory and of the biographical experiences of se-
              | vere suffering connected to it.
              | The private accommodation situation of Hülya is difficult, too. She has to
              | live with three other persons in a small room and at least one or two of these
              | other persons are on different shifts. In addition, all of these other persons seem
              | to be much older than Hülya. She always must keep quiet if she is present in
              | the room. Only later she can live with other young women, albeit they are from
              | countries other than Turkey, and since she is still not able to speak German,
              | that means that there cannot develop such warm feelings of mutual sisterly
              | support and solidarity, which she had experienced being with her young Turk-
              | ish roommates in her first place of residence when she worked in the slaughter-
              | house. The life situation of Hülya is sharply exacerbated by the future projec-
              | tion of her own life and personal development looking at the example of the
              | older roommates of her accommodation room and of the other older Turkish
              | guest workers in her new firm. Looking at the psychosocial features of these
              | persons she envisions a “natural history” of deterioration of the personal identi-
              | ties of those guest workers getting older in Germany who are totally isolated,
              | do not allow themselves to conduct their own private lives and therefore are
              | just work and salary oriented. In Hülya’s view, these old and worn out guest
              | workers became personally isolated exactly by losing the social ties of family
              | and friendship networks in their country of origin. In addition, from the point
              | of view of Hülya, their ability to relate to interaction partners in Germany with
              | feelings of solidarity, sympathy and understanding permanently deteriorated,
              | too, because they did not understand that a substitution of the lost family ties
              | by other social relationships (e.g., of getting married in Turkey or Germany, of
              | engaging oneself in Turkish and/or German voluntary associations, of finding
              | Turkish or German friends) would be pivotal. In Hülya’s view, it seems to be
              | that they necessarily became selfish, de-cultured and extremely materialistic. It
              | is the perspective of Hülya that today, at the end of this process of “natural
              | history”, the old and isolated migrant workers envision themselves and their
              | work partners just as good or bad machine operators, i.e. as just biotic, corpo-
              | real parts of the machine system, according to the rhythm of industrial work.
              | One has to take into account that here Hülya is using a common Turkish
              | contrast set of categorisation regarding life in rural Turkey (with all its expecta-
              | tion features of idyllic landscape, of freely given and trustworthy solidarity and
              | emotional relating to each other), on the one hand, and regarding the life under
              | the condition of industrial work (e.g., cf. MAURENBRECHER, 1985), on the
              | other. But she doesn’t assume that this difference is just imposed by the clash
              | of the mental forces of two different cultures, but that it is caused by the overall
              | life course and life situation of the isolated and exploited migrant worker,
              | which conditions the deterioration of their personal identities and culturedness.
              | Hülya overcomes the common German image that almost every migrant wor-
meta          | 120
text          | ker—especially those from Turkey—comes in “family packs” to Germany. She
              | draws the attention to the very fact that many migrant workers—and that is a
              | structural feature of the life of one important category of them—are utterly
              | alone in their German life situation and become even more isolated during their
              | time of permanent stay in Germany (because they are stigmatised, confined to
              | their own living quarters and self-restrained since they are not willing to invest
              | in social relationships to home-national, other-national and German partners in
              | Germany having in their mind the plan to return to their country of origin any-
              | way). Hülya has—as stated already—a “Chicago Sociology” type of perspec-
              | tive on work migration to Germany, being progressively forced into structural
              | processes of social isolation and individualisation (THOMAS & ZNANIECKI
              | 1927, PARK & MILLER 1921, ZORBAUGH 1929).
              | One of the riddles of the autobiographical narrative interview with Hülya is
              | the fact that she marks the biographical suffering related to her second work
              | position as even more intense than the biographical suffering in the slaughter-
              | house for chicken. Comparing the work organisations of the two positions the
              | second one does not have the characteristic features of the compulsory work
              | situation as the first one has. One can find compulsory work situations in pris-
              | ons, in institutions of enforced prostitution and slave trade with women and
              | children as well as in concentration camps. All these institutions exert an ex-
              | tremely dangerous impact on bodily existence and biographical identity. It is
              | remarkable, that Hülya herself reveals that she was always reminded by the
              | outfit of the mass shower room of the dormitory connected with the slaughter-
              | house for chicken—it was actually an old school building—to the gas cham-
              | bers of concentration camps (l.455). But nevertheless, the biographical suffer-
              | ing in the second work position and in the accompanying accommodation
              | situation seems to be even worse. Hülya marks the working-through of this
              | suffering as one of the important “switch stations” of her managing her migrant
              | worker trajectory. She delineates that experience and the biographical suffering
              | connected to it as a “hard blow” for her (l.512); she cries all the time (l.518),
              | and the janitor admonishes her that her permanent crying would finally kill her
              | (ll.527-528).
              | There are three reasons for the utter bleakness of Hülya’s second work tra-
              | jectory experience: First, Hülya had hoped to escape from the trajectory trap of
              | exploitative and alienating work when leaving the slaughterhouse for chicken.
              | Understandably, she had assumed that her first work situation in Germany
              | would be extraordinary through its open illegality and coercion. Now she has to
              | realise that even under correct legal conditions the dynamics of the trajectory of
              | exploitative and alienating work, in which migrant workers in Germany can be
              | entrapped, goes on and on. She also has to acknowledge, that this trajectory
              | dynamics and its organisational structural context are an overwhelmingly well
              | organised system, and that her chances for escaping them are small. Second, in
              | her second work position and the housing connected to it Hülya feels even
meta          | 121
text          | more isolated than in her first work and dwelling situation, since she lost her
              | young solidarity group of sisterly Turkish roommates. Third—and this is the
              | most important reason—Hülya envisions, looking at her future life course, how
              | her own biographical identity could develop, when she would permanently
              | remain as an isolated migrant worker in Germany. She looks into the mirror
              | image of older women who underwent the isolated migrant worker trajectory
              | for extended periods of their lives. She realises the mechanisms of becoming
              | alienated from one’s own identity connected with that isolated migrant worker
              | trajectory. Of course, she stresses in her argumentative commentary (ll.515-
              | 522) that she is different in terms of her essential features of identity “lay-out”
              | as inherited from her family and home culture. But when she explains that she
              | is “still sentimental, sensible today” she insinuates that she has already gotten
              | hardened, too (l.519). It is a nightmare for her to imagine, that she could be-
              | come just a working machine and—connected to it—could get utterly selfish
              | and materialistic like the older women with whom she lives. She realises the
              | danger of losing her own biographical identity by a systematic process of self-
              | alienation connected to the isolated migrant worker trajectory. Now she knows
              | that she has to make a serious attempt to change her life situation drastically.
              | This is her next step of biographical work: to analyse the isolated migrant
              | worker’s trajectory and to decide to hinder such a gloomy development by
              | searching for a way out.
              | 2.7. Hülya’s pre-arranged marriage as an unsuccessful attempt to
              | escape from the isolated migrant worker’s trajectory (ll.546-573,
              | 671-731)
              | Not earlier than almost two years after her coming to Germany Hülya is able to
              | go on a vacation to Turkey. Only then her mother fully realises how much her
              | daughter has suffered: she is only a shadow of herself, having lost 40 pounds.
              | And Hülya, in turn, realises how much her mother, too, has suffered from her
              | being abroad: she became severely ill immediately after Hülya’s leaving for
              | Germany. During her stay at home mother and daughter—perhaps the whole
              | family—must have understood that Hülya would not have a realistic chance to
              | become affluent in Germany and that her worker’s existence in Germany might
              | be connected to too much suffering. And note again, that immediately before,
              | while still in Germany, Hülya had detected for herself the danger of becoming
              | estranged from herself by permanently remaining entrapped in the isolated
              | migrant worker’s trajectory in the future. The double insight of Hülya, on the
              | one hand, and of her family on the other, and the communicative exchange
              | about it between Hülya and her family, especially between Hülya and her
              | mother, must have been followed by thinking about a marriage for Hülya dur-
              | ing this first stay at home, although she doesn’t report it.
meta          | 122
text          | During her next visit to Turkey, two years later (in 1976), Hülya gets mar-
              | ried to a relative belonging to the maternal part of her own extended family.
              | Hülya explains that she did not love her cousin (“...well, that was
              | ...no...marriage with great love”—ll.556). And at the same time she conveys
              | two other tacit considerations that don’t really fit well with each other: that
              | there was no alternative marriage candidate available and that she generally
              | was not in the mood to get married at all (“..., but I didn’t love anybody so
              | much either or something.”—ll.556-557), since she was still exhausted and
              | suffering from her trajectory experience of an isolated migrant worker who did
              | not find the time even to think about young men. And in addition, such a tradi-
              | tional pre-arranged marriage was not developmentally adequate for her any-
              | more, having already started to do the biographical work of one’s own life
              | historical personalisation and individualisation. The young couple remained
              | together only for one week (ll.697). Hülya gets a first impression even at the
              | wedding ceremony that her husband would not be the right partner for her:
              | “Well, we didn’t quarrel and so on, but I had...right at the...we...” (ll.696-697).
              | “But I knew this /eh/ right a way /eh/ that we didn’t harmonise. That it
              | wouldn’t end well, even if I would return home forever” (ll.706-708). And
              | during the one week of living together Hülya realises the difference between a
              | relative who is a nice, morally proper man and a husband to be loved: “Well,
              | you just expect something different from relatives and /eh/ something different
              | from your husband and ...He was .../eh/ not like I had ...imagined.” (ll.699-700)
              | It becomes clear from Hülya’s way of storytelling that her return to Turkey
              | in order to get married was originally meant to stay in Turkey and live with her
              | husband there (ll.546-547). This assumption about her original plan is in total
              | accordance with her biographical insight into the migrant worker’s trajectory of
              | exhausting exploitation, of getting culturally alienated and of losing one’s own
              | personal identity—an insight, she could win by looking into the mirror image
              | of the older women living with Hülya in the same dormitory connected to her
              | second job. Hülya envisions her marriage as a biographical action scheme of
              | escaping from the exploitation and self-alienation trajectory of the isolated
              | migrant worker.
              | But due to her experiences on the marriage day and in the following week of
              | living together, Hülya develops the action plan of returning to Germany for one
              | year; two years are not allowed by the parents by law and by her own mother.
              | Hülya gives as the official explanation for her action plan of returning to Ger-
              | many that she would like to earn the money for and buy electrical household
              | equipment and other household goods in order to let her future children learn
              | about the former migrant worker’s life of their mother (ll.565-570). Both rea-
              | sons given are not false; to the contrary, they are biographically plausible, and
              | they underline the life historical and individualized attitude of Hülya to her
              | own life. But on the other hand, these two reasons, why Hülya should return to
              | Germany again, disguise and rationalise Hülya’s new distance towards her
meta          | 123
text          | legal marriage partner. The change of her mind—first she plans to stay in Tur-
              | key with her husband and not to return to Germany, and then she develops the
              | action plan to return to Germany to earn additional money in order to buy
              | household equipment—is only understandable by assuming that she has second
              | thoughts about her marriage and wants to stay apart from it for a while in order
              | to reconsider it.
              | After her return to Germany Hülya becomes severely ill for a year, and
              | when she comes home again to Turkey one year later, she is still so weak that
              | in the beginning of her time there she can only stay with her mother. Not earlier
              | than during her last week in Turkey she finally visits her husband, who lives
              | quite far from Hülya’s parents. Hülya’s in-laws feel insulted by her late visit to
              | her husband, and he himself blames her for not having visited him immediately
              | after her arrival in Turkey and for not returning from Germany even earlier.
              | Hülya is very disappointed that he does not ask her about her health situation
              | and her suffering at all. Such a deeply felt attitude of compassion would have
              | been the only road for rapprochement and transgressing the conventional ex-
              | pectation patterns of traditional gender relating and family life. But it is obvi-
              | ous that Hülya’s husband is trapped into the mold of traditional male conduct.
              | Hülya returns to Germany again not keeping the promise to stay with her
              | husband. After some argumentative letter exchanges during the following year
              | she decides to get a divorce from him since she acknowledges that he as a very
              | traditional man with his conventional ideas about male pride is totally unfit to
              | serve as an understanding husband of an individualised young woman having
              | lived alone for a long time. Hülya follows up her action scheme of getting the
              | divorce, although her in-laws and even her own mother implore her to stay in
              | the marriage. Through her autonomous action scheme of getting the divorce
              | Hülya emancipates herself from traditional rural Turkish family culture with all
              | its responsibilities and expectations. She pursues this against the deep wishes of
              | her own mother. The dissent and emotional cleavage between mother and
              | daughter must have been very difficult for Hülya since she loves her mother so
              | dearly, and she always kept a close emotional bond with her. But here, on the
              | other hand, she has to notice and to accept a dramatic difference of the outlook
              | on life between mother and daughter.
