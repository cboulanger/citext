              | International Human Rights Law Aspects of Forced Migrations, Evictions and Displacement:
              | Current Issues and Challenges
              | Paper Presented at the „New Trends in Regional Development” Conference, Siena, June 3rd
              | 2016.
              | Summary: The aim of this paper is an analysis of the categories of evictions, forced migrations and
              | internal displacement in the context of international human rights law. Forced migrations and
              | selected categories of internal displacement are important issues of international human rights law
              | and international humanitarian law for more than forty years. The UDHR, adopted in 1948, does not
              | contain any provisions related to forced human mobility and internal displacement. Despite this fact
              | we can mention many important international law regulations focused on citizenship and human
              | mobility. The growing interest of international community on the above-mentioned issues can be
              | dated back to the nineties of the last century. First in-depth studies focused on environmentally-
              | induced displacement and development-induced displacement can be dated back to the seventies
              | and eighties of the last century. Since nineties we are observing the growing number of published
              | on these issues, inter alia by Michael M. Cernea, Bogumil Terminski, Thayer Scudder, Etienne
              | Piguet and many others. The issues of forced migrations, evictions and internal displacement are
              | currently very important areas of international cooperation. Presented articles is focused on global
              | estimations concerning the scale and dynamics of these categories (part 1), international
              | cooperation and its international human rights law aspects (part 2) and the socio-legal consequences
              | of forced migrations, evictions and internal displacement.
              | Resume: Le but de cet article est une analyse des catégories d'expulsions, les migrations forcées et
              | les déplacements internes dans le cadre du droit international des droits humains. catégories forcées
              | migrations et sélectionnées de déplacement interne sont des questions importantes du droit
              | international des droits de l'homme et du droit international humanitaire depuis plus de quarante
              | ans. La DUDH, adoptée en 1948, ne contient pas de dispositions relatives à la mobilité humaine
              | forcée et le déplacement interne. En dépit de ce fait, nous pouvons citer de nombreux règlements du
              | droit international importantes axées sur la citoyenneté et la mobilité humaine. L'intérêt croissant de
              | la communauté internationale sur les questions mentionnées ci-dessus peut être datée des années
              | nonante du siècle dernier. Tout d'abord des études approfondies ont porté sur les déplacements
              | provoqués par l'environnement et le déplacement induit par le développement peuvent être
              | remontent aux années soixante-dix et quatre-vingt du siècle dernier. Depuis des années nonante,
              | nous observons le nombre croissant de publié sur ces questions, entre autres, par Michael M.
              | Cernea, Bogumil Terminski, Thayer Scudder, Etienne Piguet et beaucoup d'autres. Les questions de
              | migrations forcées, les expulsions et les déplacements internes sont actuellement des domaines très
              | importants de la coopération internationale. Les articles présentés sont axés sur des estimations
              | globales concernant l'ampleur et la dynamique de ces catégories (partie 1), la coopération
              | internationale et de ses droits de l'homme aspects de droit international (partie 2) et les
              | conséquences socio-juridiques des migrations forcées, les expulsions et les déplacements internes.
              | Global Trends in Forced Migrations, Evictions and Internal Displacement:
              | Internal displacement: While the above stresses two important elements of internal displacement
              | (coercion and the domestic/internal movement), it is important to note that, rather than a strict
              | definition, the Guiding Principles offer "a descriptive identification of the category of persons
              | whose needs are the concern of the Guiding Principles". In this way, the document "intentionally
              | steers toward flexibility rather than legal precision" as the words "in particular" indicate that the list
              | of reasons for displacement is not exhaustive. However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, "global
              | statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights
              | violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even
              | more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence." Thus, despite the non-exhaustive
              | reasons of internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if
              | they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but name is often applied
              | to IDPs. It is very difficult to get accurate figures for IDPs because populations aren't constant. IDPs
              | may be returning home while others are fleeing, others may periodically return to IDP camps to take
              | advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur,
              | western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to
              | larger towns and cities. It is necessary in many instances to supplement official figures with
              | additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground. Thus,
              | the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate. Additionally, most official figures only
              | include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters. Development-induced IDPs often are not
              | included in assessments.
              | So-called cluster approach constitute an important area of migration studies and research on
              | internal displacement. The cluster approach designates individual agencies as ‘sector leaders’ to
              | coordinate operations in specific areas to try to plug those newly identified gaps. The cluster
              | approach was conceived amid concerns about coordination and capacity that arose from the weak
              | operational response to the crisis in Darfur in 2004 and 2005, and the critical findings of the
              | Humanitarian Response Review (HRR) commissioned by the then ERC, Jan Egeland. Egeland
              | called for strengthening leadership of the sectors, and introduced the concept of "clusters" at
              | different levels (headquarters, regional, country and operational)’. Unlike the case of refugees, there
              | is no international treaty which applies specifically to IDPs. Some have advocated re-thinking the
              | definitions and protections for refugees to apply to IDPs, but so far no solid actions have come to
              | fruition.IASC Principles deemed it unnecessary to apply the cluster approach to four sectors where
              | no significant gaps were detected: a) food, led by WFP; b) refugees, led by UNHCR; c) education,
              | led by UNICEF; and d) agriculture, led by FAO. The original nine clusters were later expanded to
              | include agriculture and education.
              | The cluster approach operates on the global and local levels. At the global level, the
              | approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key ‘gap’ areas by developing better surge
              | capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced
              | material stockpiles, and securing the increased engagement of all relevant humanitarian partners. At
              | the field level, the cluster approach strengthens the coordination and response capacity by
              | mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond
              | in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable
              | lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies at the global level both
              | participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within
              | their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at
              | the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as ‘providers of last resort’, which represents
              | the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response
              | in their respective areas of responsibility. The cluster approach was part of a package of reforms
              | accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian
              | crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and
              | evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.
              | Prevention of forced migrations is another important area of international human rights law.
              | Forced migration has accompanied persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has
              | only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is
              | the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced persons to flee to nations far removed from
              | their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that
              | the destabilizing effects of forced migration, especially in parts of Africa, the Middle East, south
              | and central Asia, ripple out well beyond the immediate region. Development-induced displacement
              | can be understood as a subset of forced migration. Such displacement is the forcing of communities
              | and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of economic
              | development, conservation of nature, dams, urbanization, re-urbanization and population
              | redistribution schemes.
              | Though the procedures for evictions differ depending on the specific laws of various
              | jurisdictions, the general process consists of 1) giving notice to the tenant (and any other person
              | residing there as well) to take prompt action to either correct the problem or otherwise leave the
              | premises (or, in some cases, unconditionally leave the premises), 2) if the tenant fails to leave the
              | premises, filing a lawsuit to evict the tenant and regain possession of the property (along with
              | amounts owed for damages, unpaid rent, and/or court costs and attorney's fees) and appearing in
              | court, and 3) if the tenant still remains in the premises, forcibly removing the tenant from them via
              | legal action. Most jurisdictions do not permit the landlord to evict a tenant without first taking legal
              | action to do so (commonly referred to as a "self-help" eviction; such actions include changing locks,
              | removing items from the premises, or terminating utility services). Such evictions are generally
              | illegal at any time during the process (including after a landlord wins an eviction suit); a tenant
              | facing such measures may sue the landlord. However, self-help evictions may be permitted in some
              | jurisdictions when commercial tenants are involved, as opposed to residential tenants.
              | Prior to filing a suit in court for eviction, generally the landlord must provide written notice
              | to the tenant (commonly called a notice to quit or notice to vacate). A landlord may evict a tenant
              | "without cause" (i.e., the landlord simply desires to end the landlord-tenant relationship without the
              | tenant being in breach of the lease, such as when a lease is about to expire) or "for cause" (i.e., the
              | tenant is in breach of the lease, such as non-payment of rent or allowing criminal activity to take
              | place on the premises). The notice to vacate may either be conditional (i.e., the tenant may remain
              | in the premises if certain actions are taken prior to the specified date, such as payment of rent and
              | late fees due; this is sometimes known as cure or quit) or unconditional (i.e., the tenant can not do
              | anything to avoid the eviction and must leave by a specified date, an example would be due to a
              | tenant engaged in criminal activity). If the termination is without cause, the tenant is generally
              | given a longer period of time (generally 30 days) to vacate than if the termination is for cause, in
              | which case the tenant may have a short amount of time (perhaps as few as three days) in which to
              | correct the violation. In some jurisdictions, landlords may not be able to terminate a lease without
              | cause (such as in rent control jurisdictions). Where the law permits, a landlord and tenant may agree
              | to a different period of time for notice requirements than specified in the law.
              | The issue of land-grabbing is another important category of evictions and displacements
              | worldwide. The issue of agricultural development is a significant driving factor, within the larger
              | umbrella of development, in target governments' agreement to investment by outsiders. The
              | Ethiopian government's acceptance of cash crop-based land acquisitions reflects its belief that
              | switching to cash crop production would be even more beneficial for food security than having
              | local farmers produce crops by themselves. Implicit in the characterization of African agriculture as
              | "underdeveloped" is the rejection of local communities' traditional methods of harvesting as an
              | inadequate form of food production. Foreign investors, through large-scale agriculture, increase the
              | effectiveness of underused resources of land, labor, and water, while further providing additional
              | market connections, large-scale infrastructure development, and provision of seeds, fertilizers, and
              | technology. Proposed increases in production quantity, as touted by investors and hosts, are
              | exemplified by Ethiopia’s Abera Deressa, who claims that “foreign investors should help boost
              | agricultural output by as much as 40%” throughout Ethiopia. In a joint research project between the
              | FAO, IIED, and IFAD, Cotula et al. found that the majority of host countries lacked basic data on
              | the size, nature, and location of land acquisitions through land registries or other public sources, and
              | that “researchers needed to make multiple contacts…to access even superficial and incomplete
              | information.”. The World Bank’s own lack of land size information on over half of the reported land
              | grabs that it researched points to the difficulties inherent in gaining access to and researching
              | individual land acquisitions. We can also mention some notable cases of land grabbing as a specific
              | category of internal displacement. In Madagascar, the anger among the population about land sales
              | led to violent protests. The South Korean corporation Daewoo was in the process of negotiations
              | with the Malagasy government for the purchase of 1.3 million hectares, half of all agricultural land,
              | to produce corn and palm oil. This investment, while one of many pursued in Madagascar, attracted
              | considerable attention there and led to protests against the government. In South Sudan, numerous
              | large-scale land acquisitions have taken place in spite of the country's unresolved political and
              | security situation. One of the most prominent, involving a former AIG partner named Philippe
              | Heilberg, garnered attention in Rolling Stone for his provocative pursuit of land in conflict-ridden
              | regions. Heilberg, who is planning to invest in 800,000 ha of land in partnership with many of
              | South Sudan's top generals and civilian officials, attracted criticism with his remarks (regarding
              | Africa and land grabbing) that "the whole place is like one big mafia — and I'm like a mafia head."
              | Development-induced displacement and resettlement (DIDR) is the forcing of communities
              | and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of economic
              | development. According to Bogumil Terminski (2012) approximately fifteen million people each
              | year are forced to leave their homes following big development projects (dams, irrigation projects,
              | highways, urbanization, mining, conservation of nature, etc.). Anthony Oliver-Smith (2009) and
              | Michael M. Cernea (2006) are also estimating that current scale of DIDR amounts to 15 million
              | people per year. An increase in alcoholism due to displacement has led to a marked rise in domestic
              | violence in India. In the Lincoln Park Community of Chicago, Illinois, where Jose (Cha-Cha)
              | Jimenez founded the human rights Latino organization: Young Lords, Mayor Richard J. Daley
              | displaced tens of thousands Puerto Ricans and the poor. This displacement helped to proliferate
              | growing street gangs. Today these gangs enterprises with murder for hire, arson for profit and drug
              | sales as its prime motivation. Displacement has made men feel helpless or insecure and turned
              | women and children into scapegoats. Displacement also leads to deterioration in health and high
              | mortality rates as services in those selected areas are the first to be cut. The nutrition and health of
              | women, which is worse than that of men even under normal circumstances, is bound to go down in
              | the event of an overall worsening in health caused by displacement. According to Michael M.
              | Cernea the main causes of development-induced displacement include: water supply (construction
              | of dams, artificial reservoirs, irrigation projects), urban infrastructure, transportation (roads,
              | highways, canals); energy (mining, power plants, oil exploration and extraction, pipelines),
              | expansion of agriculture, parks and forest reserves and population redistribution schemes.
              | According to Bogumil Terminski the principal causes of DIDR include: 1. the construction of dams,
              | hydroplants, and large irrigation projects, 2. the building of highways, roads and railroad networks,
              | 3. urbanization and social services (expansion of cities, urban transport, water supply), 4. expansion
              | of agriculture (especially monoculture plantations), 5. mining (oil exploitation, gold, copper, coal
              | mining), 6. conservation of nature, 7. population redistribution schemes, 8. other causes.
              | International Human Rights Law Aspects of Evictions, Forced Migrations and Internal
              | Displacement
              | Legal aspects of forced mobility, internal displacement and evictions is an issue well-
              | discussed in existing scientific literature. Guiding Principles of Internal Displacement (1998) ant the
              | Kampala Convention (2009) are the only international instruments devoted to this issues he
              | Kampala Convention (formally, the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of
              | Internally Displaced Persons in Africa) is a treaty of the AU that addresses internal displacement
              | caused by and large-scale development projects in Africa. The Convention was adopted in October
              | 2009. As of 2015 it has been signed by 40 and ratified by 24 of the 54 member states of the African
              | Union. The Convention entered into force on 6 December 2012, 30 days after its ratification by the
              | 15th state. Article 5(4) specifically establishes state responsibilities for the protection and assistance
              | of internally displaced persons, whose displacement is the result of "natural or human made
              | disasters, including cvlimate change. Centre of Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) is
              | important NGO actor in the field of evictions worldwide. COHRE’s work was based on the
              | assumption that the role of the affected communities is of crucial importance in addressing housing
              | rights violations. The poor themselves should be directly involved in formulating and implementing
              | solutions and alternatives. Communities have a vital contribution to make, without which most
              | housing-related projects simply will not succeed. In housing rights or eviction cases where COHRE
              | became directly involved, COHRE therefore strived to build alliances and partnerships and to
              | embark on joint campaigns with groups and support organisations working at community level.
              | Working at community level is often not sufficient in itself. As national, regional and international
              | action can be very effective in cases of major housing rights violations, COHRE also formed
              | partnerships with organisations working at these broader levels. Another tool is the collection of
              | relevant, accurate information. COHRE regularly sends multi-disciplinary fact-finding teams to key
              | focus countries. They typically conduct in-loco investigations, conduct interviews with the main
              | role players, study relevant laws, policies and programmes and do any additional research required
              | for an assessment of the nature and scope of land and housing rights violations in a particular
              | situation. This would provide the basis for drawing up recommendations and alternatives. These
              | missions are usually conducted at the request of, and in collaboration with, local partners. COHRE
              | used the draft fact-finding reports as tools for consultation and negotiations with key role-players,
              | including governments. This strategy has proven effective in convincing government to grapple
              | with the extent of the violations and the implications of proceeding with current policies and
              | practice. Once finalised, COHRE fact-finding reports are used as information resources for local
              | human rights organisations and the affected communities; for lobbying the relevant government to
              | introduce new policies, laws and programmes. Fact-finding reports are also useful tools at regional
              | and international level to place pressure on the relevant governments; and to form the basis of
              | shadow reports for submission before UN human rights mechanisms and other regional and
              | international bodies. COHRE promotes policy and legislative reform at national, regional and
              | international level, to ensure that housing rights and delivery frameworks and legal instruments are
              | improved where it is possible.
