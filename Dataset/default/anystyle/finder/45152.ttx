              | Abstract
              | Sport’s historic attraction for policy makers has been its claims that it can offer an economy of remedies to seemingly
              | intractable social problems—“social inclusion”, “development”. Such usually vague and ill-defined claims reflect sport’s
              | marginal policy status and its attempts to prove its more general relevance. The dominance of evangelical beliefs and
              | interest groups, who tend to view research in terms of affirmation of their beliefs, is restricting conceptual and meth-
              | odological development of policy and practice. There is a need to de-reify “sport” and to address the issue of sufficient
              | conditions—the mechanisms, processes and experiences which might produce positive impacts for some participants.
              | This requires researchers and practitioners to develop approaches based on robust and systematic programme theo-
              | ries. However, even if systematic and robust evidence is produced for the relative effectiveness of certain types of pro-
              | gramme, we are left with the problem of displacement of scope—the process of wrongly generalising micro level (pro-
              | gramme) effects to the macro (social). Although programme rhetoric frequently claims to address social issues most
              | programmes have an inevitably individualist perspective. Further, as participation in sport is closely related to socially
              | structured inequalities, it might be that rather than sport contributing to “social inclusion”, various aspects of social in-
              | clusion may precede such participation. In this regard academics and researchers need to adopt a degree of scepticism
              | and to reflect critically on what we and, most especially, others might already know. There is a need to theorise sport-
              | for-change’s limitations as well as its “potential”.

              | 1. Inflated and Vague Promises
              | Despite claims that sport-for-development or sport-for-
              | change is “new”, the historic rationale for investment
              | in sport has consistently been based on supposed ex-
              | ternalities—sport’s presumed ability to teach “lessons
              | for life”, to contribute to “character building” (Presi-
              | dent’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 2006)
              | and its supposed ability to contribute to the reduction of
              | a variety of social problems. Sport’s attraction for policy
              | makers has been a perception that it can offer an econ-
              | omy of remedies to seemingly intractable social prob-
              | lems (e.g., crime, “social inclusion”, “development”).
              | Social Inclusion, 2015, Volume 3, Issue 3, Pages 19-23
              | Despite the absence of systematic, robust support-
              | ive evidence (Coalter, 2007; President’s Council on
              | Physical Fitness and Sports, 2006), sports evangelists
              | have made wide-ranging, if rather vague and ill-
              | defined, claims about sport’s capacity to address issues
              | of personal and social development. In part this re-
              | flects Weiss’s (1993) contention that inflated promises
              | are most likely to occur in marginal policy areas which
              | are seeking to gain legitimacy and funding from main-
              | stream agencies. For example, Houlihan and White
              | (2002) contend that sport tends to be opportunistic
              | and reactive—a policy taker and not a policy maker. In
              | such circumstances “holders of diverse values and dif-
meta          | 19
text          | ferent interests have to be won over, and in the pro-
              | cess a host of inflated and unrealistic goal commit-
              | ments are made” (Weiss, 1993, p. 96).
              | These processes were given a major boost by two
              | broad shifts in social policy in the late 1990s. Firstly,
              | starting in the UK, but soon spreading worldwide
              | (Bloom, Grant, & Watt, 2005; The Australian Sports
              | Commission, 2006), was a shift from the traditional wel-
              | fare approach of developing sport in the community, to
              | seeking to develop communities through sport (Coalter,
              | 2007) as sport promoted itself as being able to contrib-
              | ute to the new, ill-defined, “social inclusion” agenda.
              | The second opportunity arose with the United Na-
              | tions’ embrace of sport to support the achievement of
              | the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Like the
              | concept of social inclusion, the MDGs shifted the focus
              | of investment from economic capital to social capital,
              | with a focus on personal and “social inclusion” issues—
              | strengthening education, improving community safety
              | and social cohesion, helping girls and women and
              | youth at risk and addressing issues of public health (in-
              | cluding HIV and AIDS) (Kidd, 2008). Such people-
              | centred objectives resonated with many of sport’s tra-
              | ditional claims about contributing to personal and social
              | development. However, as with social inclusion, the
              | concept of sport-for-development remains “intriguingly
              | vague and open for several interpretations” (Kruse,
              | 2006, p. 8).
              | Kruse’s comment indicates that, despite sport’s
              | new opportunities (and its opportunism), there are a
              | number of unresolved issues with the assertions made
              | by the conceptual entrepreneurs of sport-for-change.
              | For example, Coakley (2011, p. 307) argues much of
              | the rhetoric of sports evangelists can be viewed as
              | “unquestioned beliefs grounded in wishful thinking”.
              | Hartmann and Kwauk (2011, pp. 285-286) refer to “an-
              | ecdotal evidence, beliefs about the impact of sport in
              | sound bites of individual and community transfor-
              | mation, packaged and delivered more often than not
              | by those running the programs”.
              | 2. From Faith to Theory
              | Firstly, the presumed developmental impacts and out-
              | comes of such programmes tend to be vague, ill-
              | defined and lack the clarity and intellectual coherence
              | that evaluation criteria should have. There is a general
              | conceptual weakness, with a widespread failure to of-
              | fer precise definitions of “sport”; a failure to consider
              | the nature, extent and duration of participation to
              | achieve presumed impacts; the precise nature of indi-
              | vidual impacts (i.e., the effect of sport on participants)
              | and the nature of their presumed causal relationship
              | with outcomes (the resulting individual behaviour
              | change). Such variety and lack of precision raise sub-
              | stantial issues of validity and comparability and reduce
              | greatly the possibility of cumulative research findings.
              | Social Inclusion, 2015, Volume 3, Issue 3, Pages 19-23
              | This conceptual imprecision is accompanied by
              | methodological weaknesses. It must be admitted there
              | are generic methodological difficulties in defining and
              | measuring the impacts and outcomes of many social
              | interventions and attributing cause and effect in any
              | simple and straightforward way. However, such basic
              | issues of social science methods are often ignored, es-
              | pecially by the evangelists. In part this is because some
              | view research in terms of affirmation rather than un-
              | derstanding or critique. In the words of Johan Koss,
              | President of Right to Play, “we invite people to do re-
              | search into things like sport and development, sport
              | and peace. We need to prove what we say that we do”
              | (van Kampen, 2003, p. 15). Or, UNICEF (2006, p. 1) ar-
              | guing that there was “a shared belief in the power of
              | sport-for-development [and] a shared determination to
              | find ways to document and objectively verify the posi-
              | tive impact of sport”.
              | These beliefs exist despite the existence of an ex-
              | tensive body of sport and related research which raises
              | fundamental questions about the validity of the overly
              | generalised assertions about sport’s capacity to
              | achieve certain developmental impacts (Coalter, 2007).
              | It is significant that such research is frequently ignored
              | on the basis of the spurious, legitimating, claim that
              | this is a “new” area of policy and practice.
              | More fundamentally and related to the lack of clari-
              | ty is the issue of sufficient conditions. Participation in
              | “sport”, however defined and however provided, is a
              | necessary but not sufficient condition to obtain any
              | supposed benefits. In this regard Coakley (1998, p. 2)
              | argues that we need to regard “sports as sites for so-
              | cialisation experiences, not causes of socialisation out-
              | comes” and Hartmann (2003, p. 134) argues that “the
              | success of any sports-based social intervention pro-
              | gram is largely determined by the strength of its non-
              | sport components”. It might be argued that the wide-
              | spread use of sport plus approaches (Coalter, 2007) in-
              | dicates a recognition of the developmental limits of
              | “sport”. Consequently, there is a need for more sys-
              | tematic, analytical information about the various
              | mechanisms, processes and experiences associated
              | with participation in “sport”. We require a better un-
              | derstanding about what sports and sports’ processes,
              | produce what impacts, for which participants and in
              | what circumstances. One possible approach to such is-
              | sues is provided by a theory of change (Granger, 1998),
              | or programme theory (Coalter, 2013a; Pawson, 2006;
              | Weiss, 1997).
              | A programme theory seeks to identify the compo-
              | nents, mechanisms, relationships and sequences of
              | causes and effects which programme providers presume
              | lead to desired impacts and outcomes—a theory of val-
              | ue, attitude and behaviour change. It seeks to under-
              | stand the nature of sufficient conditions—the processes
              | and experiences necessary to maximise the potential to
              | achieve desired impacts. Such an approach:
meta          | 20
text          |  Assists in the formulation of theoretically coher-
              | ent, realistic and precise impacts related to pro-
              | gramme processes and participants;
              |  Enables the identification of critical success fac-
              | tors enabling a more informed approach to pro-
              | gramme design and management;
              |  Explores potentially generic mechanisms, thus
              | providing a basis for generalisation in order to in-
              | form future programme design.
              | 3. Displacement of Scope and Structural Inequalities
              | However, even if systematic and robust evidence is
              | produced for the relative effectiveness of certain types
              | of programme, even if we can identify the generic
              | mechanisms which enable some programmes to con-
              | tribute to the personal development of some partici-
              | pants (Coalter, 2013b; Pawson, 2006), we are left with
              | the problem of displacement of scope (Wagner, 1964).
              | This refers to the process of wrongly generalising micro
              | level (programme) effects to the macro (social). This in
              | part relates to old debates within social science about
              | the relationship between the individual and the social,
              | or even between values, attitudes, intentions and be-
              | haviour.
              | Although programme rhetoric frequently claims to
              | address social issues—crime, social exclusion, “devel-
              | opment”—most programmes have an essentially, and
              | inevitably, individualist perspective. Weiss (1993, p.
              | 103) suggests that many social interventions fail be-
              | cause they are “fragmented, one-service-at-a-time
              | programs, dissociated from people’s total patterns of
              | living”. Further, Weiss’s (1993, p. 105) more general
              | comment about social policy interventions and their
              | “blame the victim” perspectives can be viewed within
              | the context of sport-for-change programmes:
              | We mount limited-focus programs to cope with
              | broad-gauge problems. We devote limited re-
              | sources to long-standing and stubborn problems.
              | Above all we concentrate attention on changing the
              | attitudes and behaviour of target groups without
              | concomitant attention to the institutional struc-
              | tures and social arrangements that tend to keep
              | them “target groups”.
              | In relation to such structural issues the work of Wil-
              | kinson and Pickett (2009) raises even more fundamental
              | issues. Their core argument relates to the central im-
              | portance of the relative inequality of income and low
              | levels of social mobility in explaining a range of social
              | problems. Their data illustrate that many of the prob-
              | lems commonly associated with social exclusion (and
              | to which sport offers solutions)—crime, obesity, poor
              | general health, poor educational performance, weak
              | community cohesion—are strongly correlated with so-
              | Social Inclusion, 2015, Volume 3, Issue 3, Pages 19-23
              | cietal levels of relative inequality, with more equal
              | countries having much lower levels of such problems.
              | Further, it is clear that sports participation is related to
              | structural issues underpinning social inclusion. For exam-
              | ple, van Bottenburg, Rijnen, & van Sterkenburg (2005)
              | illustrate that the level of educational achievement is
              | the most important determinant of sports behaviour.
              | Also given the very strong relationship between social
              | class and educational opportunity, it is not surprising
              | that there is a strong relationship between social class
              | and sports participation. Also, the level of female
              | sports participation is clearly strongly correlated with
              | the relative status of women in society (Coalter, 2013c;
              | van Bottenburg et al., 2005)—one which is closely re-
              | lated to levels on inequality.
              | Such consistent relationships between social struc-
              | ture and sports participation have led one major inter-
              | national review of the effectiveness of sports policy in-
              | terventions (Nicholson, Hoye & Houlihan, 2011, p. 305)
              | to conclude that:
              | It is evident…that government policies designed to
              | increase sports participation have had limited suc-
              | cess….Some have had success…within small com-
              | munities or specific cohorts…[but] the same level of
              | success has not been apparent within the mass
              | population….It is also clear that governments and
              | researchers don’t know enough about the way in
              | which complex systems of organisations function to
              | either induce or disrupt sports participation pat-
              | terns.
              | Such persistent differentials raise important issues for
              | policies of ‘sport and social inclusion’, whose success de-
              | pends on achieving the necessary condition of increased
              | participation in sport by many socially marginal and con-
              | sistently “under-participating” groups. In this regard van
              | Bottenburg et al. (2005, p. 208) raise significant ques-
              | tions about using sport to address social issues via an
              | individualistic perspective, by arguing that exercise and
              | sport are thoroughly social phenomena and that “the
              | choice to take part in sport, how, where, what and with
              | whom is directly related to the issue of how people see
              | and wish to present themselves…socio-culturally de-
              | termined views and expectations also play a role here”.
              | The broad conclusion to be drawn from the above
              | analyses is to reverse the current fashion for arguing
              | that sport can contribute to increased “social inclusion”
              | and suggests that various aspects of social inclusion
              | precede such participation. Further, even if sport pro-
              | vides some degree of individual amelioration for some
              | of these problems, Wilkinson and Pickett (2009, p. 26)
              | offer a salutary warning about neo-Liberal, individual-
              | ized approaches to such problems:
              | Even when the various services are successful in
              | stopping someone reoffending…getting someone

              | know that our societies are endlessly re-creating
              | these problems in each new generation.
              | 4. A Need for Scepticism
              | Black (2010, p. 122) argues that the recent expansion of
              | sport-for-development policy and practice has not been
              | underpinned by “critical and theoretically-informed re-
              | flection” and others have suggested that there is a need
              | to step back and to reflect critically on what we and,
              | most especially, others might already know (Coakley,
              | 2011; Crabbe, 2008; Tacon, 2007). In this regard Portes
              | (2000, p. 4) argues that “gaps between received theory
              | and actual reality have been so consistent as to institu-
              | tionalize a disciplinary skepticism in sociology against
              | sweeping statements, no matter from what ideological
              | quarter they come”. The need for scepticism is nowhere
              | more relevant than in the area of sport-for-change. Such
              | an approach can contribute to the intellectual and prac-
              | tical development of sport-for-development by placing it
              | within a much wider world of knowledge and research
              | and by theorising its limitations as well as outlining its
              | “potential”.
