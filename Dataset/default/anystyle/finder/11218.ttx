              | Assessing the Migration Decision of Indian IT-Graduates: An Empirical
              | Analysis *
              | by Talat Mahmood and Klaus Schömann
              | Research hypotheses from various migration-theory approaches are tested
              | through a study focusing on a sample of 1,560 IT university students in India,
              | just prior to the completion of their studies. The representative survey was
              | conducted across India during the summer of 2003. The effect of economic and
              | socio-political factors on the students’ willingness to migrate was examined by
              | using variance analysis. The results show, on the one hand, a generally high
              | willingness among those surveyed to migrate to industrialised countries, but on
              | the other hand, a substantial number of IT-students want to stay in their home
              | country, India. Economic factors tend to play a much greater role on their
              | migration decisions, rather than say the sending or receiving country’s
              | institutional or socio-political aspects. The significance test of individual factors
              | shows that economic as well as institutional considerations; such as good
              | career opportunities, a high income, and a high living standard, are
              | considerably more important than other socio-political as well as institutional
              | factors. Indian IT graduates evaluated better career opportunities much higher
              | in their home country as compared to other locations. In an explicit location
              | comparison of Germany with India and the United States/Canada — the classic
              | immigration countries — as one of the potential host countries, the respondents
              | rated only language/culture significantly higher for the United States/Canada
              | than for Germany. The remaining economic and socio-political factors were
              | rated higher for USA/Canada but do not show any significant differences
              | between Germany, India, and USA/Canada. Interestingly, a location
              | comparison of India with Germany and United States/Canada shows that IT
              | graduates evaluated (salary, career opportunity, self employment,
              | language/culture and social networks) significantly higher for their native
              | country than for Germany and United States/Canada. Hence, in an international
              | competition for skilled labour/best IT specialists, India has also emerged as an
              | attractive location.

              | Zur Bewertung der Migrationsentscheidung von IT-Hochschulabsolventen
              | aus Indien: Eine Empirische Untersuchung
              | Wir testen Forschungshypothesen aus migrationtheoretischen Ansätzen
              | anhand einer Stichprobe von 1,560 kurz von dem Studienabschluss stehenden
              | IT-Hochschulabsolventen aus Indien. Die repräsentative Befragung wurde im
              | Sommer 2003 landesweit in Indien durchgeführt. Mit Hilfe der Varianzanalyse
              | wird die Wirkung der ökonomischen sowie gesellschaftspolitischen
              | Einflussfaktoren auf die Migrationbereitschaft der Hochschulabsolventen unter-
              | sucht. Die Ergebnisse zeigen einerseits eine hohe generelle Migration-
              | bereitschaft der indischen IT-Absolventen in Industrieländer. Andererseits ist
              | aber das Verbleiben in ihrem Heimatland Indien eine starke Alternative.
              | Ökonomische Gründe spielen generell für die Migrationentscheidung eine viel
              | wichtigere Rolle als andere institutionelle oder gesellschaftspolitische Aspekte
              | im Herkunfts- und Empfängerland. Der Signifikanztest der einzelnen
              | Einflussfaktoren bestätigt, dass ökonomische Gründe wie gute Karrieremöglich-
              | keiten, hohes Einkommen und besserer Lebensstandard bei allen Empfänger-
              | ländern signifikant wichtiger sind als die gesellschaftspolitischen Determinanten
              | (wie Ausländerfeindlichkeiten, Aufenthalterlaubnis, Sprache und Soziale
              | Netzwerke). Indische IT-Hochschulabsolventen bewerten gute Karrieremöglich-
              | keiten höher in Ihrem Heimland als bei allen Empfängerländern. Bei einem
              | konkreten Standortvergleich zwischen Deutschland, Indien und dem
              | klassischen Immigrationsland USA bewerten die Befragten die Determinanten
              | (wie Soziale Netzwerke, Karrieremöglichkeiten, Möglichkeit der Selbstständig-
              | keit, das Gehalt und Sprache) signifikant wichtiger für Ihr Heimatland als für die
              | USA und Deutschland. Im Wettbewerb um die besten IT-Experten ist Indien im
              | Vergleich zu Nordamerikanischen Ländern und Deutschland ebenfalls ein
              | attraktiver Standort.

              | Introduction
              | The starting point of current discussions about foreign immigration into Germany has been
              | skill shortages on the German labour market. Particularly for specialists in information and
              | telecommunications technology, the mismatch on the German labour market has now
              | reached the critical point where it is actually inhibiting growth. Both the increasing worldwide
              | competition for highly qualified specialists and managers and globalisation trends, in general
              | have resulted in increased emigration of German skilled workers and, at the same time,
              | create the need for greater immigration into growth markets. The problem has recently been
              | attracting growing attention from actors in industry and commerce, public policy and politics
              | (Unabhängige Kommission Zuwanderung, 2001). The demand for information technology
              | (IT) specialists is particularly strong with respect to specific types of technical knowledge
              | (e.g. programming languages) and special “international skills”, such as opening up foreign
              | product markets for companies and their partners.1
              | The most influential factors behind these trends are increasing globalisation and
              | demographic changes. Stalker (2000) referred to the strong globalisation effect in connection
              | with a heightened degree of labour mobility in the twenty-first century. Labour mobility —
              | caused by growing pressure on the labour supply, increasing disparities in income between
              | respective countries and, above all, the revolutionary development of information and
              | communication technologies — will play an increasingly important role in the international
              | dissemination of knowledge and technology. On the other hand, demographic changes over
              | the last few decades have been leading to a population decline in Germany and are having
              | unwelcomed side-effects on economic development and innovative capacity.
              | The consequences of these trends for Germany have become all too evident: more
              | intense international competition for the most talented, a growing demand for well-qualified
              | workers, an expansion of the markets, and a competitive disadvantage in the information and
              | communication technology fields as a result of high wage costs.
              | Two main reasons are given for the shortage of specialists in Germany: first, the
              | constantly changing state of the computer technology and its continued rapid growth
              | worldwide, and, second, the failure of German universities and polytechnic colleges to
              | provide workers with training that is adequately geared to the needs of the labour market.
              | Therefore, in order to roughly meet skill needs further training and retraining schemes for the
              | available domestic labour force are necessary, as are efforts, already underway, to build up
              | the number of students and graduates in these fields (Neugart, 2000).
              | This long-term labour shortage is considered to be the overall cause for the
              | emergence of so-called migration flows. To solve this problem, the German Federal

              | Zukunft der Arbeit [Institute for the Study of Labor], Bonn), for which 340 telephone interviews in
              | Germany and 170 interviews each in France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were
              | conducted (Winkelmann, 2001).
meta          | 1
text          | Government, in cooperation with industry and commerce, has now established a “Green
              | Card Emergency Programme to Meet the Demand for IT-Specialists” (Green Card
              | Sofortprogramm zur Deckung des IT- Fachkräftebedarfs:
              | http://www.bma.bund.de/download/broschueren/a232.pdf) which enables such specialists
              | from non-EU countries to work in Germany for up to five years. In view of the prevailing
              | domestic labour market problems, economic migration was not a desirable option. Most do
              | agree, however, that a selective migration policy would bring overall economic benefits to
              | recruitment countries (Zimmermann, 1996).
              | Migration research shows that the scale of international migration will increase
              | overall. Little, however, is known about the determinants of past and present migratory
              | movements, in particular those of IT specialists and highly educated persons, who could
              | generate such migration flows (Regets, 2001). Current discussions still focus on whether a
              | selective policy would bring overall economic benefits. What is more, the topic of immigration
              | itself seems to be a controversial matter in Germany, both socially and politically.
              | Particularly with regard to immigration from developing countries, no extensive
              | empirical research has been carried out to date, which takes into consideration not only the
              | economic and social aspects of migration but also the political and institutional factors.
              | Vogler (1999) has analysed these factors using an aggregated panel data set of asylum-
              | seekers who migrated from developing countries. A study by Fiedler (2000) deals with the
              | question of the conditions for which highly qualified IT workers migrate from India to
              | Germany. To conduct this study a questionnaire was used to interview 48 employees of an
              | IT company: the results confirm the participants’ willingness to migrate based on migration-
              | specific factors.
              | Most empirical studies carried out thus far discuss in detail the question of which
              | factors influence decisions to migrate. The aim of these studies is to ascertain the best
              | strategy for the countries involved from a migration-policy perspective, in order to control
              | economically motivated migratory movements. The data basis of such research is for the
              | most part, official statistics with the use of various methodological approaches. These studies
              | place an emphasis on immigrants who have completed the migration process, whereas
              | those remaining in their native country are not included in such studies. In the current
              | economic environment the international labour market situation, as described above,
              | requires a change in outlook: mutual mobility is desirable, especially in the case of high-tech
              | workers.
              | The aim of this study is to ascertain, on the basis of information gained through
              | surveys, the economic and socio-political determinants of the decision to migrate. While
              | using variance analysis, we empirically analyse the effect of these determinants on migration
              | decisions by IT university students in India, just prior to the completion of their studies, as if
meta          | 2
text          | they would migrate to Germany or some other high-wage country.2 In addressing this
              | question, we test existing theories from migration research and draw conclusions for the
              | German case which pertain to the various decision factors.
              | In the second section of this paper we discuss several basic theoretical
              | considerations from which the examined research hypotheses are derived. The survey data
              | and the variables of the statistical analysis are then introduced. The fourth section presents
              | both the descriptive findings and the test results from the variance analysis. The final section
              | discusses implications of the research results and provides an outlook for further planned
              | research.
              | 2.
              | Theoretical Considerations
              | According to Han (2000), migration is a complex process, which, as far as its emergence and
              | development is concerned, is continually determined through a multiplicity of causes and
              | factors. As a rule the causes triggering this process are a mixture of objectively compelling
              | exogenous factors (e.g. company contacts or attraction through foreign research laboratories
              | and resources) and subjectively justified decisions (e.g. good career opportunities, starting a
              | family). A classic approach to explaining the complex and multicausal determinants of
              | migration can be found in the theory of so-called push and pull factors.
              | Push factors (migration factors) comprise all those conditions of the migrants’ country
              | of origin that induce them to migrate or temporarily migrate, such as political or religious
              | persecution, economic crises and international wars. Pull factors (factors that attract
              | migrants) are those circumstances in the host country that motivate and encourage them to
              | migrate. Factors that may attract migrants are, for example, political stability, a democratic
              | social structure, economic prosperity, better education and wage/salary opportunities relative
              | to those in one’s own country. It is generally assumed that with modern information, and
              | communication and transportation capabilities, push and pull factors are becoming ever more
              | important to individual migration decisions. Gatzweiler (1975) pointed out that in the end
              | every migration decision is the result of push factors from the source country and pull factors
              | from the target country working together.
              | An array of approaches in the migration-theory literature aim to identify and explicate
              | important determining factors for an individual’s willingness to migrate or for aggregated
              | migration flows. The starting point of most theoretical models attempting to explain individual
              | migration decisions is the neo-classical approach. The majority of micro-economic models is
              | based on this approach, which views migration as a form of investment that is worthwhile or
meta          | 2
text          | After successful completion of this pilot study, other Asian countries and/or East European
              | countries will be brought into the research project.
meta          | 3
text          | “profitable” for some individuals, but not so for others. The human capital approach maintains
              | that migration takes place when the cost directly incurred through it will be reimbursed or will
              | “pay for itself” through higher income in the future. Because of unemployment and other
              | economic and non-economic aspects, migration is often connected with financial and social
              | risks. According to neo-classical models, possible reasons for the relatively low level of
              | immigration from developing countries are a strong preference for one’s present
              | environment, high migration costs, poor labour market chances, great uncertainty and the
              | hope that developments in one’s native country might unexpectedly turn for the better.
              | Cobb-Clark and Crossley (2001) state the family investment hypothesis for Australia,
              | which would only be empirically tenable for “traditional” families, and not for non-traditional
              | families in which both partners, the husband and the wife, are gainfully employed. On the
              | other hand, the new economy of migration challenges the central role of relative income
              | differences, because it views this difference as only one important point among others with
              | regard to the decision for or against migration.
              | There are considerations on the macro-economic level as well, which in the end can
              | be traced back to a micro-economic foundation. Among these are demographic trends, self-
              | selection of migrants, self-sustaining migration and institutional restrictions on migration.
              | Demographic trends are quite important: higher population figures in the sending country
              | lead to per se greater migration flows. With regard to the causes of self-sustaining migration,
              | so-called network effects command the greatest attention. These result from the fact that,
              | apart from the contacts amongst themselves, migrants above all, maintain good contact with
              | their native country. Through this exchange of information, the information and migration
              | costs go down for all future migrants. People who have migrated in the past help the next
              | ones with assimilation in the receiving country and also help reduce psychological costs that
              | may arise through separation from one’s native country (Bauer, Epstein and Gang, 2000).
              | The other approach is based on political as well as economic factors and holds that
              | the cause is both the rapidly growing migration potential in developing countries in addition to
              | the limited opportunities for immigration as a result of insufficient intake ability or a lack of
              | receptiveness. Hence, when analysing migration flows the basic institutional conditions
              | should also be taken into account (Vogler and Rotte, 2000).
              | Relative to the large number of theoretical approaches (cf. Borjas, 1994; Vogler,
              | 1999), there are few empirical findings, particularly with regard to migration from developing
              | countries. This is due, in part, to a lack of suitable or adequate data sets, in addition to the
              | fact that no extensive national or international research has been carried out up to now. As
              | well, there are hardly any studies available that analyse the determinants of international
              | migration, which take into account not only the economic and social aspects of migration but
              | also the political and institutional factors. Furthermore, very few of these studies deal with the
              | question of why migrants, despite knowledge of the incentives, stay in their native country
              | and do not emigrate.

text          | An empirical study by Marr (1975) analysed migratory movements from the United
              | States, the United Kingdom and Germany to Canada from 1950 - 1967. According to him,
              | relatively better working conditions and higher income played a significant role as pull factors
              | towards Canada. A different study by DeVoretz and Maki (1983) examined the migration of
              | highly qualified workers from 16 developing countries to Canada from 1968 -1973. They
              | found that occupation-specific employment opportunities were much more important for well-
              | qualified workers than earnings opportunities. In contrast, Greenwood and McDowell (1991)
              | gave differences in income as the most important push factor.
              | An empirical study by Zimmermann (1994) examined asylum-related emigration from
              | four major regions — Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East — to the European
              | Union during the years 1983–1992. He found that the level of unemployment in the individual
              | countries had the expected negative impact on immigration, whereas the size of the
              | respective labour market and the level of its relative wages exerted a positive influence.
              | Huang (1987) chose to focus on the migration of well-educated workers from 1962–1976.
              | The estimates reveal the expected influence that the respective wage differentials would
              | have on a stay in the United States (i.e. push factor). Fleischer (1963) studied migration from
              | Puerto Rico to the United States and found that, here too, economic opportunities proved to
              | be the most significant influence for migration across national borders.
              | Whereas the research discussed up to this point is based on the analysis of cross-
              | sectional or longitudinal data, Vogler (1999) made use of a panel data set for his analysis of
              | migration to Germany. It covers information on migration from 86 source countries for the
              | period 1981–1995, including the number of asylum-seekers for the years 1984–1995.
              | According to Vogler’s findings, the decision of an individual to migrate from a developing
              | country to an industrialised nation can be interpreted as an investment. In making this
              | decision the potential migrant compares the future income in his or her native country with
              | that of the target region and also takes into consideration the costs associated with
              | migration. Other factors to be taken into account include unemployment, social services and
              | taxes, both in one’s native country and in the country of destination (i.e. push and pull
              | factors).
              | The German Economic Institute in Cologne (Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln,
              | 2001) has investigated companies’ and IT specialists’ previous experiences with the German
              | Green Card. The study found that most of the reasons for taking up work in Germany were of
              | an economic nature. First and foremost, it is especially important for almost all foreign
              | specialists that they be given the opportunity to do “interesting work” in Germany. Foreign IT
              | specialists next rank the advanced vocational training offered in second place. Good career
              | and advancement opportunities are given as the next reasons for a stay in Germany.
              | Bartel (1989) studied the migration behaviour of different groups of migrants (Asians,
              | Europeans and Hispanics) to the United States in 1980. His research shows that the network
              | effects are very strong. Regions with a high number of residents belonging to a particular

text          | ethnic group are the preferred destination of migrants of that respective group. In both their
              | micro-economic and macro-economic studies, Bauer and Zimmermann (1995) found a high
              | level of significance for network effects on migration. In a recent study Bauer, Epstein and
              | Gang (2000) examined the influence of a migration network on migrants’ decisions based on
              | location. They observed that the size of the Mexican network within the United States has a
              | positive effect on the likelihood of migration.
              | From the perspective of the receiving country, there are essentially two types of
              | studies on the differences in income between native residents and immigrants. Studies
              | following the approaches of Chiswick (1978) and Borjas (1987) find an initial income
              | disadvantage for immigrants when compared to native residents who are of the same sex,
              | educational level and age and who work in the same industrial sector. However, according to
              | their findings, the situation improves over time, and a gradual equalisation of earned income
              | takes place. Other studies using the traditional decomposition method to calculate
              | differences in income associate the unexplained remainder of differences in income between
              | native residents and immigrants with statistical discrimination. Recently, Nielsen, Rosholm,
              | Smith and Husted (2001) have attributed comparable orders of magnitude of income
              | differences, to a deficiency in qualifications and work experience as well as incomplete
              | assimilation.
              | A good deal of the public discussion, however, revolves around the fear, not yet
              | empirically researched, that a German Green Card might give rise to entire waves of
              | immigration comparable both to the recruitment of migrants in the 1950s and 1960s and to
              | the consequences for the present form of the social system first and even second
              | generations migrants(Fertig and Schmid, 2001). The PISA Study findings for Germany point
              | to further pressure still surfacing with third generation immigrants. To bring more objectivity
              | to this discussion, we have chosen to contribute new empirical results, which were gathered
              | directly from a highly mobile group of IT specialists in an important potential source country.
              | In this way one can speak of an ascertainment of an “upper benchmark” for potential
              | migration from any one source country.

              | Survey Data and Description of Variables
              | This study is based on a personal survey3 of university information and communications
              | technology students in their final year of study in India. Around twenty IT institutions
              | participated in the survey. Letters to the appropriate professors explained that a foreign

text          | university graduates. This organisation’s origin was not mentioned in order to avoid a
              | country-specific bias in the results.
              | Consistent with the survey design of this study, the university students were only
              | questioned about their expectations for the future relating to possible migration decisions
              | during this first stage of research. The students were information technology and electrical
              | engineering students in their final academic year of a master’s and bachelor’s programme
              | and, hence, possessed to the highest academic education equivalent to that of academically
              | trained German engineers. In order to analyse actual immigration to Germany and other
              | industrialised countries, we will make a second survey one year later to again interview both
              | the graduates who migrated and those who remained in their native country. This step will
              | enable us to compare their previous intentions to migrate with their actual decision.
              | 3.1.
              | Questionnaire Design: Push and Pull Factors
              | The questionnaire has four main sections. In the first section, the students are questioned
              | only about their personal characteristics. In the next section, they are only asked about
              | individual determinants that might influence their migration decisions. In the third section, the
              | students are asked to rank a number of alternative countries according to their preference. In
              | the final section they are to explicitly assess, taking into account both the respective country
              | and the importance of the various determinants, whether or not they might migrate to a
              | particular country.
              | The relevant aspects to individual migration decisions are determined on the basis of
              | general theories on migration behaviour, empirical research results and motives for migration
              | already named in surveys. However, it would go beyond the scope of this project to take into
              | account all possible push and pull factors. For this reason the analysis has been restricted to
              | the most important factors, which are briefly presented below.
              | 3.2.
              | Social Networks, Chain Migration
              | We start with the assumption that before a person makes a decision to migrate he or she
              | makes a comparison of possible destinations, a task that requires relevant information about
              | the sending and the receiving country. This information may come from different sources,
              | such as various media and information agencies that deal with the systematic recruitment of
              | labour, and private information channels (Feithen, 1985).
              | Whereas knowledge about the determinants of the sending country is based mainly
              | on one’s own experiences, information about the receiving country can only be gathered
              | through external sources (Gatzweiler, 1975). Personal relationships to relatives and friends
              | are of utmost importance in obtaining such information (Feithen, 1985). The dominance of
              | private information channels can be explained by the fact that the weight of social and
              | emotional bonds can outweigh other factors when making a migration decision. Treibel
meta          | 7
text          | (1999) has argued that one cannot always assess reliability of such information. This
              | circumstance also helps explain the so-called chain migration phenomenon, which is the
              | larger subsequent migration flows of people who have been informed by previous migrants
              | (Han, 2000). Networks with continuing obligations and expectations may arise through the
              | use of such personal relationships. The migrant networks resulting from this process help
              | reduce risks and uncertainties by supplying valuable information (Faist, 1997). The relatively
              | pronounced mobility of highly qualified workers can also be understood in this context:
              | Because they have a comparatively high level of information available to them as well as a
              | wide job-search range open to them, they often find it easier to migrate than do workers with
              | average skills and education (Janssen, 1998).
              | 3.3.
              | Career/Self-employment Opportunities and Improved Professional and
              | Social Status
              | In principle, improvement of professional status can be grouped with the improvement of
              | social status as one reason for migration, because the latter usually follows from the former
              | as a result of an increase in income (Feithen, 1985). One push factor related to such
              | professional concerns is the lack of advancement opportunities in those sending countries
              | characterised as developing countries. In comparison, there is an opportunity to make gains
              | in professional and social status through migration to developed countries (Blahusch, 1992).
              | One pull factor is the possibility for relatively better on the job training/advanced vocational
              | training in industrialised countries. According to Schipulle (1973), since highly qualified
              | people have an especially strong desire to improve their status, it is hardly surprising that
              | they often name professional career planning as a motive for migration (Körner, 1999).
              | 3.4. Salary / Income Situation and Standard of Living
              | One complaint of highly qualified workers in sending countries relates to the poor wages
              | received. This aspect represents an important push factor (Körner, 1999), whereas higher
              | income in industrialised countries functions as a pull factor (Blahusch, 1992). The
              | comparatively low income in their countries of origin, in contrast to the high income in
              | industrialised countries together result in another cause of migration (Breidenbach, 1982).
              | According to Schipulle (1973), as a rule, the difference in income between the developing
              | and the industrialised country must be exceptionally large in order to induce migration. What
              | is more, income frequently symbolises a person’s standing and abilities and, as such,
              | represents a measure of his or her accomplishments and success. A high income also leads
              | to more respect within one’s social sphere (e.g. standard of living).

text          | 3.5. Hostility Towards Foreigners
              | Social distance, which can lead to hostility towards foreigners in the receiving country,
              | hinders migration (Gatzweiler, 1975). Through the rise of prejudices against foreigners,
              | xenophobia can be found time and again in alarming situations for the economy, society,
              | politics and culture (Bade, 1994; for an international comparison and evaluation, see
              | Koopmanns 2001). Such a situation in the target country deters potential migrants, who fear
              | that they might come to harm during their stay abroad (Thelen, 2000).
              | 3.6. Language/Culture
              | Fischer and Straubhaar (1998) were the first to describe the value of immobility in a
              | systematic way by drawing from several new hypotheses. They argue that some skills and
              | part of one’s abilities are location-specific. These internal, country-specific advantages are
              | not just of an economic nature; rather, they are culturally, linguistically, socially and politically
              | binding factors. The effect of these factors and of one’s native country on migration is like
              | that of a “push factor” preceded by a minus sign. In addition, they deal with advantages
              | specific to particular businesses, regions and societies.
              | When the languages of the sending and receiving countries differ, language barriers
              | arise, resulting in a smaller probability of migration (Feithen, 1985). Because mobility
              | depends considerably on an individual’s language abilities, which in a figurative sense reflect
              | one’s ability to integrate (Körner, 1999), highly qualified people tend to exhibit a relatively
              | high probability of migration because of the additional linguistic proficiencies they often
              | possess (Janssen, 1998).
              | 3.7. Duration of Stay
              | The permitted duration of stay in a receiving country is an important institutionally defined
              | determining factor. The different immigration laws of countries can work to discourage or
              | attract migrants. The United States, as the classic immigration country, is a good example of
              | a pull factor in this regard, whereas Germany, with its non-immigration policies, can be
              | considered a push factor. If migrants take this institutional factor into consideration in their
              | decision-making process, the likelihood of migration may decrease.

              | 4.1. Evaluation of the Factors
              | In this section we investigate how individual factors might influence the decision of university
              | students to migrate abroad (using several countries as possible choices). Of the 1,590

              | to indicate on a scale of 1 to 6 the extent to which each of the determinants would influence
              | their migration decisions (1 = negligible influence/unimportant criterion; 6 = large
              | influence/important criterion). The six criteria were salary, language/culture, social networks,
              | standard of living, opportunities for self-employment and career opportunities. The
              | participants were first asked to judge the importance of the six criteria on their decision of
              | whether or not to migrate, independent of the choice of countries in question.

              | reveals that decisions about migration are determined mainly through economic

              | Ranking of Countries
              | In this section of the questionnaire the students were asked to rank the preferred country of
              | their choice. They were asked to evaluate the countries irrespective of the determinants
              | already given, and to rate each one on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest). A total of 1,560
              | cases were available for our analysis; the remaining responses could not be taken into
              | account because of missing information. As shown in figure 2, the respondents indicated that
              | their preference lay first and foremost with their native country, India, with a mean value of
              | 4.7 — This indicates that the participants of the survey view their home country with a well
              | developed IT sector. The USA/Canada with a mean value of 4.6 was found to be the next
              | most preferred country.. In comparison with those who chose North American countries, a
              | lower inclination to migrate is found for those individuals who chose Great Britain (3.8) or
              | Australia (3.7). Finally, the participants’ rating of Germany put it into fifth place with 3.3,
              | before “other countries (mostly the Middle East countries)”, which came in last place.

              | United States/Canada, leaving Great Britain in third place among the target countries—only
              | around one hundred respondents (6.54%) decided for Great Britain. Germany came in

              | the second most important decision-making factor for all of the foreign countries, except their
              | native country, India. The second most important criterion found for the participants in India
              | was salary. For all other remaining countries, they viewed salary as the most important
              | determinant with the highest mean values. Standard of living was given third place for all
              | countries, and as well played an equally important role for those deciding to stay in India.
              | For India, social networks ranked fourth place, whereas for all the other countries the
              | participants viewed this factor as least important (except for Great Britain). Participants
              | ranked opportunity for self-employment in India in fifth place and the fourth most important
              | criterion for all other countries considered here.
              | Language/culture was ranked sixth for most countries except USA/Canada and other
              | countries. For India, duration of stay was ranked seventh by the participants, whereas it was
              | ranked at fifth place for Australia, Germany and Great Britain (USA and Canada at sixth
              | place). Surprisingly, the influence by tolerance towards foreigners was found to be the least
              | important factor not only for India but also for Great Britain. For all remaining countries
              | (Germany, USA/Canada, Australia and other countries)it was ranked equally in seventh
              | place.

              | institutional or socio-political criteria. In comparison, social networks play almost as important

              | In this sub-section we investigate whether the mean values of the eight criteria differ
              | significantly from one another. To this end, variance analyses were carried out for each of
              | the six countries5 and the results are presented in table 2. The criterion salary was selected
              | as the reference category. The coefficients of the remaining factors indicate the difference for
              | the mean value of salary (X i − X salary ) . T-values are given in parentheses for the hypothesis
              | that these differences are zero (H 0 : X i − X salary = 0). The F -value given in the last line of
              | the table tests the hypothesis that all eight mean values are equal. This can be rejected for
              | each of the six alternatives at the 1% level.
              | The first column of table 2 shows the comparison of the mean values of the variable
              | salary with the other criteria for N = 499 individuals who chose India. The mean value for
              | salary is µs = 5.75; whereas it is µco = 5.84 for career opportunities. The difference for salary
              | is µco - µs = 0.085. With a t-value of 1.49, this difference is positive but insignificant. The
              | positive sign means that those students who chose India evaluated career opportunities
              | higher than salary.
              | In this connection it becomes evident that career position does not have the highest
              | preference for the remaining countries (negative sign, also not significant). However, only for
              | those individuals who chose India is the difference between career opportunities and salary
              | not significant at the 1% level (see column 1). In all remaining countries career opportunities
              | was viewed significantly lower than salary.
              | This result is not consistent with a qualitative study conducted by Fiedler (2000). The
              | interviewees cited better career prospects in their home country as important advantages
              | over other countries. Furthermore, the participants judged their career prospects with
              | German companies not so optimistically. A study by the “Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft
              | Köln (2001)” found that it is especially important to almost all foreign IT specialists that they
              | find interesting work in Germany. The questions of whether they may further join their
              | education at new work place and if the company will offer them good career perspectives
              | also played an important role.
              | For those final-year students who chose Germany (column 3), the difference of
              | standard of living from salary is –0.825. This is significant with a t-value (–3.60) at the 5%
              | level. The minus sign means that these individuals rate standard of living significantly lower
              | (at the 5% level) than career opportunities and salary. The standard of living factor is ranked
              | third not only for India (see column 1 of Table 1) but also for the remaining countries.

              | This finding also corresponds with a hypothesis from Schipulle (1973), which states that for
              | migrants, income frequently serves as an indication for the abilities of a person, that is, it
              | represents a measure of one’s achievements and success. A higher income leads to more
              | respect within one’s social sphere and/or to a higher standard of living.
              | For Germany, the difference between the mean values of self-employment
              | opportunities and salary amounts to –1.08, and is significant at the 10% level with a t-value
              | of –5.28. This implies that the individuals who chose Germany evaluated possible self-
              | employment lower than they did salary, career opportunities and standard of living. For all
              | the remaining countries, possible self-employment receives fourth place (except for India).
              | This finding confirms the work of Han (2000), who referred to migrants’ observations about
              | why they normally first venture to make the transition from salaried employee to self-
              | employed entrepreneur only after waiting some years. Reasons given include low wages and
              | a lack of opportunities for advancement.
              | Another factor which influences students’ decisions about migration, and which
              | should not be underestimated, is institutional regulations such as the permitted length of
              | stay. As table 2 shows, the difference between the mean values for duration of stay and
              | salary comes to –1.292 for Germany, with a t-value of –4.79 indicating significance at the 1%
              | level. This result shows that participants attributed less importance to duration of stay than to
              | salary and other criteria.
              | The difference between the mean values for language/culture and salary is –1.37.
              | The t-value is significant at the 1% level. Those individuals who chose Germany assessed
              | the importance of language/culture significantly lower than they did salary. Feithen’s
              | hypothesis (1990) that the likelihood of migration decreases when different languages are
              | spoken in the sending and the receiving countries, leading to a language barrier, was not
              | confirmed through this analysis. With regard to the criteria language, Janssen (1998) has
              | argued that a relatively high probability of migration predominates among highly qualified
              | persons. Our empirical evidence confirms this theory, for in our analysis the determinant
              | language/culture received a quite low ranking.
              | As expected for Germany, the influence of social networks is lowest in comparison
              | with all other determinants (significant at the 1% level). There are only small groups of
              | migrants from Southeast Asia in Germany. One noteworthy result for India is that the
              | influence of social networks is viewed as important in comparison to salary, with the
              | significance of these networks ranked fourth. Otherwise, social networks receives seventh
              | place for Great Britain (see table 1) and last place for all other countries. For those
              | individuals who wished to seek employment in India, the influence of social networks is not
              | significantly smaller than that of salary or career opportunities. The remaining factors play a
              | less important role here (significant at the 1% level). In Fiedler’s study (2001), none of those
              | surveyed evaluated social contacts within Germany very highly. Up to now emigrants from
              | India to Germany have had very little opportunity to rely on long-established social networks.

text          | The factor with the least effect when reaching a decision to stay in India was,
              | predictably, hostility towards foreigners. On the other hand, this criterion also had the
              | smallest influence for Great Britain as well as for all remaining countries, including Germany,
              | for which it was ranked next to last. Our findings do not confirm Gatzweiler’s hypothesis
              | (1975) that social distance, which may lead to xenophobia within the receiving country, has a
              | negative impact on migration.
              | In sum, it can be concluded that the individual criteria are evaluated at a significant
              | level for each respective country. For India, career opportunities and salary are considerably
              | more important in the decision-making process than the other criteria, whereas they are of
              | less importance for the remaining countries. The remaining decision-making aspects were
              | classified as significantly less important (negative co-efficients) for both Germany and the
              | other country options. According to an f- test carried out, the null hypothesis that all mean
              | values are equal can be rejected at the 1% level for all of the alternatives.

              | Comparison of Mean Values of the Deciding Factors between the Six
              | Countries
              | In this sub-section further variance analyses are carried out for each of the eight
              | determinants in order to ascertain whether the mean values differ to a significant degree
              | between the six countries.6
              | The results of the final-year students who chose Germany have been selected as the
              | point of reference. The coefficients of the remaining criteria indicate the difference for the
              | mean value for Germany (X i − X Germany ). T -values for the hypothesis that these differences
              | are zero, are given in parentheses (H 0. : X i − X Germany = 0). The f- ratio given in the last line
              | tests the hypothesis that all six mean values are equal, that is to say, that the preference
              | structure (ranking of the evaluation of the determinants) of the students does not differ
              | significantly from each other.
              | The first column of table 3 compares the mean values of the six alternatives for the
              | factor salary. The mean value for Germany is 5.23; whereas for the United States/Canada it
              | is 5.50. The difference comes to 0.270 with a positive but statistically insignificant t-value
              | (0.04).. This suggests that those who chose the United States/Canada assessed the factor,
              | salary, higher — by an amount of 0.270 — than those who chose Germany. In other words,
              | for the former group, salary is more important than it is for the latter group.
              | This result confirms the well-known differences in income between Germany and the United
              | States in the IT sector. It also confirms that, when comparing locations, the participants

text          | consider the determinant salary to be very important in reaching a decision. The positive
              | effect of salary in a target country on migratory movement, set out numerous times in theory
              | and confirmed by nearly all empirical studies to date, is found in this study as well.
              | Furthermore, participants who decided for Great Britain evaluated salary higher (t-value not
              | significant) than did those who chose Germany. Interesting is that this factor plays a very
              | important role for India (positive and significant co-efficient). This means that those students
              | who chose India evaluated salary higher than that for Germany by an amount of 0.52.
              | Furthermore, Breidenbach’s theory (1982), which states that the comparatively low income in
              | source countries and the correspondingly high income in industrialised countries together
              | result in one cause for migration, is not confirmed by our findings.
              | Our analysis confirms the general assumption in Germany that the need to learn the
              | German language might have a negative effect on the decision to migrate to Germany. The
              | findings reveal that the determinant language/culture is rated considerably higher by those
              | who chose the United States/Canada or “other countries” (significant at the 5% level),
              | whereas the coefficient for Great Britain is insignificant for those who chose Germany. As
              | expected, Germany has the lowest mean value in this connection (3.92, ranked sixth).
              | What’s more, our results confirm Feithen’s hypothesis (1985) that different languages in the
              | sending and the receiving countries lead to a language barrier and a decreased likelihood of
              | migration to that country.
              | The f-test for this criterion can not be rejected at a level of significance (f-test: 3.65).
              | Hence, the equivalence of the mean values can be ruled out to a significant degree, and the
              | university students have no significant preference structure for any particular country. This
              | situation tallies with the conclusion reached by Hoffmann (2001) and Wagener (2000) that
              | the German language is to some extent viewed as a fundamental problem for those
              | interested in the Green Card. Owing to this language barrier, Germany is to be regarded as
              | the second to last choice after the English-speaking countries (except USA/Canada). Fiedler
              | (2000), on the other hand, comes to the conclusion that the language barrier is actually quite
              | modest on the whole, and suggests that the willingness to migrate is high, despite language
              | barriers.
              | As expected, social networks was evaluated the highest by those participants who
              | wished to stay in their native India (t-value: 4.66 at the 1% level). Surprisingly, the positive
              | values of the coefficients show that network effects are evaluated as more important in the

              | other alternative. One should note here that with regard to the question on the presence of
              | relatives or friends abroad, the United States/Canada, Great Britain and remaining countries
              | were not viewed as significantly important at all.
              | In general, the considerable importance of network effects on migration has been
              | confirmed empirically by both micro- and macro-economic studies (see, for example, Bauer
              | and Zimmermann 1995 for an overview). Network effects also proved to be an important
              | influence on migration in a study by Vogler (1999). Furthermore, Fiedler (2000) has shown
              | that a large share of interviewees who migrated to Germany did not receive their information
              | from relatives or friends, and has, therefore, concluded that there is a lack of personal
              | contact to people living in Germany. After India, Great Britain is ranked second to last
              | (ranked seventh, see table 1). Significant differences among the six alternatives can be
              | found for this criterion (f-value: 19.16), showing that these university students in their final
              | year evaluate this factor differently when comparing specific locations.
              | There are no significant differences between the countries with respect to tolerance
              | shown towards foreigners. Thus, equivalence of mean values cannot be ruled out. Only
              | those participants choosing Great Britain, the United States/Canada or “other countries”
              | rated this criterion slightly higher (plus sign, but insignificant co-efficient) than did those who
              | preferred Germany. Hence, the hypothesis from Gatzweiler (1975), discussed above, is not
              | confirmed by our findings. As one might expect, university students remaining in India
              | assessed this determinant better than did those deciding for Germany. Amazingly, this
              | criterion shows a minus sign (statistically significant) for Australia as well. No significant
              | differences between the six country options can be proven for tolerance towards foreigners.
              | In addition, with the exception of India and Great Britain, this determinant was least important
              | for all options considered here (ranked last, see table 1). For Germany, Australia and USA
              | and Canada, it was ranked the second to last.
              | The respondents who chose the United States/Canada rated the duration of a
              | residence permit slightly higher (t-value: 0.73) than did those who decided in favour of
              | Germany. With the restrictive immigration policy in effect until just recently, foreign university
              | students in Germany, in particular those from developing countries, were obliged to return to
              | their native country upon completion of their studies. These strict measures have now been
              | relaxed, for reasons already discussed in this paper.
              | As expected, the duration of a residency permit for India is less important (t-value of –
              | 1.54) than it is for Germany. The participants evaluated this factor as equally important for
              | Australia and the remaining countries in comparison with Germany. They did not rate the
              | criterion significantly higher for Great Britain and “other countries” than for Germany. With an
              | f-value of 5.09, the null hypothesis of equivalent mean values can be ruled out for this
              | determinant. Therefore, not much of a difference for this criterion can be shown for the six
              | country options.
meta          | 21
text          | With regard to the criterion standard of living, it was evaluated as somewhat more
              | important by the university students who picked India and all remaining countries (t-values
              | positive, but insignificant). Hence, our results, to some extent, confirm Feithen’s hypothesis
              | (1985) that an enhanced social status results from increased income, which in turn is
              | achieved through improved occupational status in an industrialised country. A study by
              | Fiedler (2000) also demonstrates that the considerations of decision-makers with regard to
              | leaving their native country, above all, have to do with the advantage of improved financial
              | status. Yet the merits of better job opportunities and of a higher standard of living, which may
              | come through emigration and which are closely connected with financial betterment (the
              | former a precondition and the latter a consequence of one’s financial situation), also receive
              | considerable attention. According to an f-test (f-value: 2.59), equivalence of the mean values
              | for the criterion standard of living can be ruled out; that is, the determinant is evaluated
              | differently for the countries under consideration.
              | According to the t-value (significant at 2.34), the criterion opportunities for self-
              | employment is relevant for India. In comparison with the results for Germany, it is also
              | important for those university students who selected United States/Canada, Australia, Great
              | Britain or “other countries”. Students who decided in favour of these countries found the
              | possibility of self-employment somewhat more pertinent: (the co-efficients are positive, but
              | statistically insignificant). According to Han (2000), empirical surveys show that self-
              | employed migrants generate higher incomes on average, than do those in dependent
              | employment relationships.
              | Career opportunities in India are of importance: the IT-students, who wished to remain
              | in their native country, found this attribute important (t-value: 2.31 at 5% level of
              | significance). Those who chose Australia assessed the career opportunities there higher
              | than they did those in Germany. The co-efficients are positive for all countries but statistically
              | insignificant: these individuals rated the career opportunities there higher than they did those
              | in Germany. This result confirms the hypothesis of Schipulle (1973) and Körner (1999),
              | which holds that highly qualified persons have a strong desire to improve their status and
              | often experience their own career planning as a pull factor for migration. Equivalence of the
              | mean values can be rejected for this criterion at a significance level of 0.000% (f-value: 4.09)
              | and the effects of these determinants differ significantly between the various countries.
              | In sum, those individuals who chose the United States/Canada evaluated
              | language/culture significantly higher than those students who selected Germany. The other
              | criteria depict positive but statistically insignificant coefficients indicating more importance for
              | the North American countries than for Germany. Social networks, self-employment, career
              | opportunities, salary, language/culture and duration of stay are found more important for
              | India than for Germany. Social networks was ranked fourth by those who decided to stay in
              | India, in comparison with the other options. Our country comparison showed significant
              | differences for the criterion hostility towards foreigners; whereby the mean values for the
meta          | 22
text          | other alternatives differ significantly at the 1% level. Hence, the null hypothesis of equivalent
              | mean values can be rejected.

              | Conclusion
              | In this study, we examined the expectations to migrate and the migration decisions among
              | highly qualified IT university students in India. By carrying out variance analyses, we tested
              | and analysed the information gained through this on-site survey, which was based on a
              | questionnaire designed to evaluate the economic and socio-political factors pertaining to the
              | students’ migration decisions.
              | Our findings reveal, on the one hand, a relatively high willingness, in general, to
              | migrate to industrialised countries and on the other hand, a substantial amount of IT-students
              | want to stay in their home country. In the detailed questionnaire on country preferences, the
              | participants viewed, in addition to their home country, the North American countries (United
              | States and Canada) as their first choice in every respect. Germany was placed second to
              | last in the ranking of preferred countries, placed before other countries.
              | A comparison of the mean values for Germany reveals that economic aspects such
              | as salary, career opportunities, standard of living and the possibility of self-employment are
              | evaluated significantly higher than other institutional or socio-political factors. Particularly
              | noteworthy is India’s first place ranking with regard to career opportunities, whereas this
              | determinant is placed second for all remaining countries.
              | When evaluating particular factors for each respective country, economic aspects,
              | such as career opportunities, salary and standard of living, are very significant factors for all
              | countries. The remaining socio-political determinants, such as hostility towards foreigners,
              | duration of residence permit, language and social networks, are viewed as less important
              | both for Germany and the other countries considered.
              | The individuals who chose the United States/Canada and Great Britain evaluated
              | language/culture significantly higher than did those students who chose Germany. There are
              | no significant differences between these countries and Germany with respect to the
              | remaining criteria (coefficients positive but insignificant).
              | Possibilities for self-employment, career opportunities, social networks, salary and
              | language/culture were found to be important for India. For those who wish to stay in India,
              | social networks take first place compared to all others. No significant differences were
              | measured in our country comparison for the factor hostility towards foreigners and for the
              | other factors the mean values differ significantly at the 1% level. For their home country India
              | IT-students viewed career opportunities, salary and opportunity for self-employment, social
              | networks and language/culture as the most decisive factors for their migration decision.

              | Outlook and Implications
              | In this analysis the quantification effects of the determinants or elasticities have not yet been
              | estimated. In future research these effects will be carried out with the help of econometric
              | techniques, such as discrete choice models.
              | One conclusion to be drawn for economic policy recommendations and implications is
              | that salary, career opportunities, social networks and language are particularly important
              | aspects for locations that attract potential migrants. In order to be internationally competitive
              | and to attract special IT-high potentials, government authorities might also want to consider,
              | in connection with wage policy, whether tax breaks and incentives for the newly arriving IT
              | specialists, for example covering larger shares of language courses at least for the first
              | years, might increase Germany’s attractiveness as a location relative to other industrialised
              | countries. As a result of such measures, these highly qualified specialists would then have
              | more income available. From the current starting salary of EUR 51,000 (a condition of the
              | Green Card), immigrants must pay for further language courses and higher enrollment costs
              | when placing their children in German language schools. As is well known, highly qualified IT
              | specialists earn considerably more in the United States than in Germany. Hence, earned
              | income alone provides little incentive for the top talents to come to Germany. On the other
              | hand, business is expected to pay competitive wages like those in the United States, a
              | situation which up to now would represent a location disadvantage in Germany for small and
              | medium-sized businesses.
              | Career opportunities was also named as one of the most important reasons for
              | migrating, but it has, as well, been found to be the most important factor for staying in India.
              | Quick integration of persons living here is essential, particularly for those working in high-
              | tech industries. Prospects should be offered for career advancement in various branches of
              | the economy so that the best specialists are motivated to produce innovative work for
              | Germany and help create competitive products. Opportunities for advancement should be
              | facilitated in both the private sector and public administrations, and furthermore, the
              | transition to self-employment could be facilitated for these groups of applicants.
              | The university students who selected the United States/Canada said that they
              | consider a permanent visa as an important factor in their decision to migrate. For those IT
              | specialists who have already arrived in Germany through the Green Card scheme, this
              | institutional barrier — that is, the five-year restriction currently in effect or recently introduced
              | — should be eased for reasons of competitiveness and integration. With the possibility of an
              | indefinite stay, immigrants in Germany will have a more long-term perspective and higher
              | chances of integration. It would then also be possible to build up social networks. In addition,
              | naturalisation could be made easier for foreigners, who have special knowledge and skills
              | and already live in Germany, in order to ensure better integration.
meta          | 24
text          | Language and cultural barriers for new immigrants could be reduced by offering
              | supplementary language courses at universities or Goethe-Institutes in the respective source
              | countries. In this way, the migrants could acquire basic language skills early on and bring this
              | knowledge along, thereby facilitating quick integration.
              | Although hostility towards foreigners was not found to be a significant factor, detailed
              | information on the “Green Card” immigrants should be provided to native residents. This
              | information should clearly explain to the public the predominantly economic reasons for the
              | employment of IT specialists, and thereby also making the advantages of immigration more
              | evident to native residents.
