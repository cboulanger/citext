              | Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?
              | A Study of Works Councils in the Textile Industry**
              | This study has two aims: firstly to examine the general pattern of works
              | councillor attitudes towards management in the East German textile industry;
              | secondly to investigate the effectiveness of these works councils in representing
              | workers' interests. A survey of works councillors in over fifty mostly privatised textile
              | firms provided some initial indication that they have a cautious, co-operative attitude
              | towards management and are surely not „extended arms of management“ as has
              | been often declared in the literature. Moreover, a survey of the unionised workers in
              | these firms revealed an overwhelming acceptance of their works councils and a
              | conviction that the limited effectiveness of these institutions is mainly caused by the
              | current economic constraints rather than by internal deficiencies of the new
              | institutions.
              | Dieser Artikel verfolgt zwei Zielsetzungen: Es werden die Einstellungen von
              | Betriebsräten zur Betriebsleitung und die Wirksamkeit ihrer Interessenvertretung in
              | über 50 ostdeutschen Textilunternehmen untersucht. Die Fragebogenuntersuchung
              | der Betriebsräte zeigt eine vorsichtige, grundsätzlich kooperative Einstellung zur
              | Betriebsleitung und widerspricht dem in der Literatur häufig dargestellten Bild des
              | ostdeutschen Betriebsrat als „wehrloses Anhängsel“ der Betriebsleitung. Die
              | Befragung der gewerkschaftlich organisierten ArbeiterInnen in diesen Unternehmen
              | unterstützt dieses Ergebnis und zeigt, daß der Betriebsrat mehrheitlich begrüßt und
              | als neue institutionalisierte Interessenvertretung akzeptiert und auch aktiv unterstützt
              | wird. Die eingeschränkten Erfolge der Betriebsräte in den letzten Jahren werden in
              | erster Linie der schwierigen wirtschaftlichen Lage der Textilindustrie und nicht, wie
              | vielfach vermutet, Unzulänglichkeiten der Institutionen selber zugeschrieben.

text          | Works councils were forbidden during the socialist regime but have been widely
              | established following the transfer of the (West) German industrial relations system into
              | the East in 1990 (see Jander and Lutz 1991; Kirschner 1991).1 The development of
              | works councils in East Germany after Unification has been a popular topic of industrial
              | relations research in the last five years (e.g. Dathe and Schreiber 1993; David 1992;
              | Mickler and Walker 1992; Röske and Wassermann 1991; SOFI Göttingen [e.g. Bluhm,
              | Kern and Land, Kirschner, Voßkamp and Wittke]; Berlin/Göttingen group [Kädtler,
              | Kottwitz, Jander, Lutz, Rosenbaum, Weinert]; WISOC Chemnitz [e.g. Ermischer,
              | Kreißig, Lungwitz, Preusche]). Although much interesting work has been done, there
              | are perhaps two deficiencies. The first is at the methodological level. The published
              | research is almost entirely based on expert interviews and/or case studies of specific
              | companies. More representative, quantitative studies have yet to be undertaken. The
              | second deficiency is on a contextual level. Although it has been frequently argued that
              | employees are crucial actors at workplace level, there are still no broadly-based,
              | quantitative studies of their attitudes, opinions or behaviour at this level.
              | This paper addresses these deficiencies in a study of workplace relations in the
              | East German textile industry. Two main issues are discussed. Firstly, it examines the
              | pattern of works councillor attitudes towards management through a questionnaire.
              | Secondly and perhaps more importantly, it investigates the extent to which works
              | councils are effective in representing workers interests. This will be discussed by
              | analysing the perceptions of unionized workers towards their own works councils.
              | The paper starts by reviewing the relevant literature on workplace relations in East
              | Germany.

              | Co-operative Workplace Relations or Works Councils as „Extended Arms
              | of Management“?
              | Research on East German workplace relations commonly distinguishes between
              | the period before and the period after privatisation of the East German enterprises,2
              | since privatisation is seen as having a radical impact on workplace relations (e.g.
              | Dathe and Schreiber 1993: 6; Ermischer and Preusche 1992; Hürtgen 1992). With
              | regard to the first period, one may distinguish two views. The first argues that the
              | relationship between management and works council was typically essentially co-
              | operative, whilst the second argues that it was one in which the works council was
              | typically subservient.

text          | The West German Works Constitution Act (BetrVG 1972), the legal foundation of works
              | councils, was introduced on June 1st 1990 before the political Unification (October 1990).
              | The East German (state) industry was privatised through the Treuhandanstalt Berlin, the state
              | privatisation agency, which started its work in 1991. The Treuhand took over the assets and
              | liabilities (over 100 Mrd Deutsche Mark) of the East German industry (combines). In 1992
              | the Treuhand had responsibility for over 5.100 companies (Treuhand prospectus
              | „Entschlossen Sanieren“ 1992: 17). In the end of 1994/beginning of 1995 the Treuhand had
              | completed its work of privatising most of the firms and was dissolved.
meta          | 198
text          | Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?
              | Analysts in the first tradition see the enterprise as being characterized by a co-
              | operative relationship, i.e. „co-management“ (Ermischer and Preusche 1993) or
              | „partnership for progress/construction“ („Aufbaupartnerschaft“) (Röske and Wasser-
              | mann 1991), and they offer three main reasons.
              | Firstly, the legacy of former socialisation and „collective“ experiences in
              | socialist workplaces (e.g. life-long employment in the same firm, everyone knowing
              | each other, and with no extreme social status differences between management and
              | workers) is said to enhance co-operation.
              | Secondly, there is said to have been a particular inter-dependence between
              | management and works councils: both parties had an equal status in the beginning,
              | even that management was sometimes in a weaker situation since it had to earn/
              | regain legitimacy from the workforce (i.e. unclarified power relations, i.e. „power
              | vacuum“ [Machtvakuum]) (e.g. Kirschner 1992: 85). Consequently, it is claimed that
              | management was dependent on the works council to get the support of the workforce
              | for any restructuring. Moreover, both parties faced radical challenges from the
              | internal and external environments. It is argued that this worked as a force for co-
              | operative relations in order to have at least one stabilizing factor during the difficult
              | survival process. According to Ermischer and Preusche (1995: 55) „the co-operation
              | enhanced the plant level process of transformation and helped to compensate for the
              | lack of experience of both management and the works council with the strange
              | economic and legal system“. One should also note that the common „enemy“, the
              | Treuhand (the state privatisation agency) arguably induced „emergency associations“
              | (Notgemeinschaften).
              | Thirdly, there was the particularly unifying aim of (a) preparing the enterprise for
              | the market economy (e.g. Dathe and Schreiber 1993: 9), and (b) of dismantling the
              | political structures, i.e. „de-ideologisation“ of the work structure and organisation (e.g.
              | getting rid of the „red socks“). Some even argue that there has been a third unifying
              | aim, the development of more employee involvement (Ermischer and Preusche 1992: 2).
              | In sum, these authors conclude that co-management generally emerged in their
              | case study companies because of the specific internal situations after the „Wende“
              | (turnaround). Ermischer and Preusche's empirical investigation (interviews in 34
              | companies of mostly the metal industry in Saxony from 1991 onwards) bases its
              | conclusion on the finding that in the majority of cases the management and works
              | council saw their relationship as a positive, co-operative relationship with the aim of
              | achieving consensus (1993: 185).
              | It is a weakness of these studies that we are not told which interview questions
              | were asked, nor are important terms like „co-operation“ clearly defined. For example,
              | the perception of „shared goals“ does not necessarily lead to an effective
              | codetermination, i.e. co-operation. It is also possible that if a works council shares the
              | same goals as management, it does not see the need to become pro-active.
              | This view is supported by the other school of thought on these issues who propose
              | that co-operative works councils in East Germany are „extended arms of management“

text          | rather than „independent“ and effective worker institutions. Some of their arguments
              | will be reviewed: Jander and Lutz (1991: 411) of the Berlin/Göttingen group found in
              | their surveys3 that cases of pro-active works councils were the exception rather than the
              | rule, and they speculate that these were likely to have been concentrated around Leipzig
              | and Dresden (the home of the civil movement). They also found that even in the
              | beginning, when works councils formally attended management meetings, they did not
              | participate greatly in the decision making, but basically agreed to decisions which
              | sounded economically rational. For example, there was no works council in their sample
              | which had developed alternatives to management's reconstruction concept. In general,
              | works councillors were found to be very open to economic arguments because of their
              | belief that economic irrationality led the former system into ruin. Economic rationality
              | and especially technological progress were often seen as panaceas (also Dathe and
              | Schreiber 1993: 42; David 1992: 132-134). Mickler et al.'s case study of VW gives an
              | impressive account of the works council's agreement to the introduction of lean
              | production without any restrictions (1992: 16). Moreover, according to Jander and Lutz
              | (ibid.) East German works councils generally did not (and still do not) mobilize against
              | staff reductions, because they are accepted as unavoidable, and avoid any politicisation
              | of labour relations, since this is seen as a core reason for the old mis-management.
              | Consequently, as Kädtler and Kottwitz (1994: 27) argue, the „works council as a
              | partner/arm of management“ is often believed by works councillors themselves to be the
              | ideal type (see Kotthoff's typology below). Accordingly, as the authors conclude, the
              | relationship between management and works council is not seen by the councillors as
              | the expression of any fundamental conflict of interest but as a „functional
              | complementary relationship“. Similarly, their study found that works councils, having
              | realized that their scope for action is very limited, were persuaded that co-operation is
              | the best posture. The authors mention that „it is not the announcement of a third or
              | fourth redundancy round which causes a 'hardening of the fronts' but instead the times
              | when management violates the rights of the works council or is guilty of negligence“
              | (p.28). Thus, only when informal norms were violated, did the works council become
              | „aggressive“.4
              | Jander and Lutz also remark that the early attendance of the works council at
              | board meetings in some firms could easily be seen more as a management strategy to
              | get the workers to accept organisational changes than as an indicator of co-
              | management. In addition, Kädtler (1992: 8-10) cannot find any evidence to suggest that

text          | Expert interviews and documentary work in 40 companies in Saxony and Thüringen during the
              | unification period (1989/90) and six intensive longitudinal case studies (mainly from interviews
              | with works councils) in these regions, plus equivalent investigations around Berlin (22
              | companies) till 1992/3 (see Jander and Lutz 1991; Kädtler and Kottwitz 1994) make up their
              | empirical underpinning. Most companies were of the metal, chemical or electronics industry.
              | The author of the present article observed the same in a chemical company which she visited
              | in Bitterfeld in 1993. It experienced mass redundancies without any interference from the
              | works council or workforce, but when management once violated a specific legal
              | (information) right of the works council, the works council organized an immediate walkout.
meta          | 200
text          | Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?
              | there were conflicts in the early period (Winter 1989) in those enterprises, which had
              | quite extensive rights for their works councils, over the introduction of the more
              | restrictive German works councils law. He goes so far as to argue that even if the
              | broader participation rights had been kept, the outcome of „co-management“ would
              | have been the same, largely due to the particular economic and political context.
              | There is more agreement among analysts as the quality of workplace relations
              | after privatisation. The workforce, works council and management no longer jointly
              | face the Treuhand in safeguarding the interests of the enterprise. It is argued that the
              | classic division of interests between capital and labour therefore becomes more
              | explicit (Ermischer and Preusche 1995: 59; Lungwitz and Preusche 1994). Workplace
              | relations become characterized on the one side by management strengthening its
              | position (e.g. legitimized by new owners or by a management buy-out), and
              | frequently reinforcing „taylorist“ control and disciplinary methods (e.g. Bluhm 1992;
              | Lippold et al. 1992; Voskamp and Wittke 1991). On the other side the deteriorating
              | economic situation is regarded as to reduce the task of works councils to that of
              | administrating redundancies instead of „co-managing“ the on-going reorganisation.
              | For example, Mickler et al.'s case study (e.g. 1992) of the new Volkswagen car
              | factory in Saxony showed that the informal „survival pacts“ which existed in 1990
              | were starting to fall apart by 1992: management wanted more productivity and the
              | workforce wanted to keep their traditional piece rates and customs. Thus, Mickler et
              | al. write that it is „not the democratisation of workplace relations, but company’s
              | survival, massive redundancies and the securing of a minimum social standard
              | [which] determines the daily work of the councils“ (1993: 21). Finally, it is argued
              | that privatisation often leads to the employment of West German or foreign managers
              | who are likely to challenge the established East German community (see Aderhold et
              | al. 1994).
              | In sum, the literature on workplace relations in East German enterprises before
              | privatisation can be categorized into two broad camps, a positive/optimistic one (e.g.
              | WISOC) who propose co-operative (and effective) works councils, and a negative/
              | pessimistic one (e.g. Berlin/Göttingen). Obviously, these two groups are „ideal
              | types“. Both sides however agree that there has been a shift and deterioration in
              | works council-management relations over the years.
              | The characterisation by some researchers of early workplace relations as co-
              | operative would be enhanced by a precise definition of concepts such as „co-
              | operation“ or „co-management“. Was it „real“ co-operation, say between two equally
              | strong partners,5 or a more one-sided acquiescence on the part of the works council?
              | Furthermore, the argument that „co-operation“ has declined since privatisation does
              | not say what it has been substituted by. Does „non-co-operation“ mean a conflictual
              | relationship or does it mean that the works council becomes (or continues to be) an
              | extended arm of management, thus administering management functions, as
meta          | 5
text          | Co-operation is often defined differently, e.g. that people willingly co-operate because of
              | mutual gains (see Axelrod 1990).

text          | Mahnkopf (1991: 280) or Jander and Lutz (1991) argue? Obviously, it is difficult at
              | this stage to make clear judgements about this development, so that statements
              | inevitably remain vague, e.g. Ermischer and Preusche's (1995: 60) conclusion that
              | their case studies in 1994 show „more conflictual relations without the loss of co-
              | operation“. In addition, the discussion on „co-management or conflict“ seems to be
              | burdened with the problem that the authors seem to have different understandings of
              | what they mean by these terms, and that the concepts themselves are difficult to
              | operationalize.
              | 3.
              | Effective Works Councils?
              | Related to the question of co-operation is whether works councils manage to
              | represent workers' interests effectively or not. However, there is little West German
              | research evaluating the quality of workplace relations and, in particular, examining
              | the interrelation between the two actors in terms of effective interest representation.
              | The only major study which focuses on the quality of interest representation is
              | Kotthoff's longitudinal case study analysis of 64 companies (1981; 1994),6 which
              | created a useful typology of works councils and distinguished between: (i) deficient
              | forms of interest representation: „the ignored works council“; „the isolated works
              | council“; „the works council as an extended arm of management“; and (ii) effective
              | forms of (autonomous) interest representation: „the respected, co-operative works
              | council“; „the respected, steadfast works council“; and „the works council as a co-
              | operative hostile power“. There is no corresponding East German research on this
              | issue, which is partly explained by the fact that it is especially hard to measure the
              | effectiveness of interest representation during times of transformation. The most
              | common approach in the current East German literature is to outline some problems
              | which works councils are currently facing and to assert (rather than to analyse) that
              | these problems hinder the proper functioning of works councils. There are at least
              | five problems mentioned in the literature (more by the Berlin/Göttingen group, e.g.
              | Kädtler and Kottwitz (1993; 1994), than by WISOC) and it is difficult to disentangle
              | them: (i) the intensified classical dilemma facing works councils of balancing the
              | interests of the company and the workforce in the devastating economic situation of
              | East Germany (e.g. Kottwitz 1991: 417); (ii) the unsuitability of the West German
              | industrial relations system in the East German context (one frequently given reason for

              | the unions) (e.g. Lippold et al. 1992; Mahnkopf 1991: 282, 1993: 17); and (v) the
              | supposedly low image of the works council among the workforce, i.e. workers perceive
              | works councils as ineffective (e.g. Jander et al. 1992).
              | Kädtler and Kottwitz (1993: 4) go so far as to suggest that these deficiencies in
              | workplace relations have implications for the functioning of the whole industrial
              | relations system. According to Jander and Lutz (1993) there is the paradox that
              | although the West German industrial relations system was transferred without any
              | adjustments to the particular East German situation, East Germany could very well
              | end up not practising the same industrial relations as the West, especially because of
              | the ineffective works councils (see also Jacoby 1994). For these researchers therefore
              | the likely scenario is of a few companies with „good“ workplace relations surrounded
              | by a majority of companies with poor co-determination practices (see also Mahnkopf
              | 1991).
              | However, listing possible reasons why works councils might not be effective is
              | not an entirely satisfactory exercise. The authors do not provide persuasive evidence as
              | to why these problems render works councils ineffective, nor do they analyse whether
              | these supposed problems are short-term (due to the novelty of the institutions) or long-
              | term (due to the structural unsuitability of western regulations in the East).
              | Furthermore, it has also not been tested how far these problems, rather than, for
              | example, unco-operative management, account for any works council ineffectiveness.
              | There are also problems with the arguments as such. To give just one example: arguing
              | that the West German system is not suitable for the specific East German situation does
              | not provide a convincing explanation why this should evoke a dysfunctioning of the
              | works council. Without wanting to go into the debate as to how far the situation in the
              | East today is comparable with that of West Germany after 1945 (see Jacoby 1994), it
              | seems a dubious assertion that the West German industrial relations system only
              | „works“ in prosperous economic situations. The system seems to have managed
              | various recessions during the last few decades in West Germany.
              | As said before most of the studies are based solely on interviews with
              | councillors (and sometimes with management). Very few came from more
              | comprehensive case studies and none includes workers' attitudes and behaviour
              | towards the new institutions. This study attempts to contribute to the analysis of the
              | quality of workplace relations in East German firms in two ways. Co-operative
              | workplace relations will be investigated by focusing on one side, works councillors'
              | attitudes towards management, only. Moreover, the study examines the „customers“
              | of works councils, the workforce, and analyse their perceptions of the works council's
              | effectiveness.

              | Method
              | The study comprised two surveys, one of works councillors and one of
              | unionized workers in selected textile companies in East Germany. The purpose was to
              | apply a quantitative method to the investigation of the workplace relations from a

text          | works councillors' and workers' point of view in a larger sample of workplaces
              | (compared to the research reviewed).7
              | The textile industry was and still is (similar to other manufacturing industries)
              | severely affected by Unification and the subsequent exposure to the world market
              | which led to a dramatic reduction in employment8 (e.g. Küchle and Volkmann 1993).
              | It was mainly selected because the textile industry is a sector which has not been
              | looked at in the research of transformation and is largely neglected in the general
              | industrial relations studies in Germany.
              | The two surveys9 were carried out in 1994 in textile firms across the bargaining
              | region of the South East branch of the German textile union, GTB (Gewerkschaft für
              | Textil und Bekleidung). The union branch covers the largest part of East Germany
              | and includes the traditional textile cities in Saxony. At the time of the study (Summer
              | 1994) this union area comprised 385 textile and clothing firms with 28,070
              | employees, of which 14,425 were union members. This results in a union density of
              | 48.2% (GTB Information 1994).
              | The works councillor questionnaire was distributed to works councils of that
              | district and was returned by 53 works councils.10 The questionnaire consisted of two
              | parts, one dealing with background information of the extent of transformation which
              | occurred in the firm, the other dealing with a set of Likert-scale attitudinal questions
              | on the workplace climate. These were adopted from Dastmalchian et al. (1991),
              | Angle and Perry (1986) and Allen and Stephenson (1983).
              | The union membership questionnaire was conducted in the above surveyed 53
              | textile firms in 1994 and comprised altogether 73 questions on various issues of the
              | transformation of the workplaces. The questionnaire was distributed through the union
              | machinery and works councils to union members. 440 completed questionnaires were
              | returned, which gives a response rate of approximately 40%. All questions were
              | answered on 5-point Likert scales. A selection of the items which deal with workers'
              | perception of the works council and workers' willingness to actively support the works
              | council is presented in the table of the results section. Workers' willingness to become
              | active is used as an additional, more indirect measure of people's views of the
              | instrumentality of works councils. A certain amount of trust in the institutions'
              | effectiveness is assumed to be necessary for people to engage in works councils'

              | questionnaire was to be filled out by one full-time councillor, not necessarily the chief
              | councillor. The questionnaire consists of 29 questions altogether.

              | Results
              | 5.1 Background Company Information of the Works Councillor Survey
              | Four topics were discussed, organisational changes (ownership, management,
              | staff reductions, technology), workforce characteristics (male/female ratio), union
              | membership (density), and incidents of industrial conflict. Most firms had been
              | privatised (only 7 were still owned by the Treuhand) and belonged to West German
              | or foreign companies or via MBO to management. Changes in management had
              | occurred in most sites, yet there was a mixed picture regarding old/new managers. 22
              | (out of 53) firms had either kept all or most former managers and 30 firms kept no or
              | only very few former managers. At the supervisory level nothing really had changed,
              | with 41 firms having kept the former supervisors. T-tests11 revealed no significant
              | differences between private and state ownership with regard to changes at
              | supervisory level and changes in management. Thus, privately owned firms had not
              | necessarily more „new“ supervisors and managers than Treuhand firms.
              | With regard to staff reductions, most firms had reduced their staff by at least
              | 50%,12 which was not uncommon in other industries (e.g. Nolte and Sitte 1995). With
              | regard to the medium-term prospects of their firms, the respondents were split: 22 were
              | sceptical and 20 were more optimistic. Privately owned firms were more optimistic
              | than Treuhand firms, and firms with new management felt more secure than those with
              | former managers staying.13 A majority of firms had invested in new machinery and
              | restructured the production process. Most works councillors perceived the work pace
              | on the shopfloor to have increased enormously from 1989. With regard to the
              | workforce, in only three firms was the female rate less than 50% of the total workforce,
              | and in 16 it was higher than 90%. This confirms the female dominance in the textile
              | workforce. Union density was still high: in 11 firms it was over 80% and in 20 between
              | 30 and 79% (which is roughly in line with the union density of the district: 48,2%). T-
              | tests revealed that the density was stronger in firms with former managers and in more
              | unsecure firms, but not necessarily stronger in Treuhand firms compared to private
              | ones. There were only three incidences of industrial unrest so far, which supports the
              | idea of the textile industry as a non-militant sector, and the larger the female share in
              | the workforce the lower was the likelihood of industrial unrest. Finally, with regard to
              | the responding works councillors, over half have had been in position since 1990/91.

              | old unionists are in a majority in East German works councils could not be supported
              | here. Furthermore, although this was not explicitly controlled for, one can assume that
              | all respondents were union members (since the GTB only distributed questionnaires to
              | unionised works councils14).
              | 5.2
              | Workplace Climate from the Viewpoint of the Works Councillors
              | The idea was to apply a set of previously tested questions here in order to
              | examine the quality of workplace relations (i.e. workplace climate) from the works
              | councillors' viewpoint. It is obvious that this cannot provide a complete picture of the
              | workplace situation. In addition, this small-scale survey is not able to establish
              | various types of works councils such as Kotthoff's detailed categorisation. However,
              | it might be a first approach to investigate the two opposite hypotheses of the
              | literature, works council as „co-manager“ or as a powerless „extended arm of
              | management“ in a relatively large sample of one industrial sector. The first eight
              | items of table 1 define the quality of the management–works council relations,
              | whereas the remaining questions explore broader related topics.
              | Three quarters of the respondents agreed on most issues, and there were virtually
              | no missing answers. The first eight items were put into factor analysis and revealed
              | two factors. The first factor (items 1.-4.) is concerned with the practice of
              | management–works council relations, whereas the second factor (items 6.-8.)
              | describes councillors' more general views on management.15

text          | Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?
              | With regard to the first factor, the workplace relationship was typically
              | perceived as harmonious, the councillors were willing to do their part, and problems
              | were often solved informally. On the other hand, councillors felt insufficiently
              | involved in strategic planning and insufficiently informed. These might be seen as
              | „standard“ complaints of councillors and one might conclude that in overall the
              | positive perception of the general relationship succeeds.
              | There were significant correlations16 between whether the general relationship
              | was perceived as positive and the number of former directors employed in this
              | company (r= .29*) and whether the councillor was a former BGL official (r= .27*):
              | Works councillors in a company with no former directors were more likely to
              | perceive the relationship as „good“ as in companies with former directors, and works
              | councillors who were not former BGL officials were more likely to perceive the
              | relationship as good than works councillors who were former BGL officials. This was
              | also confirmed by t-tests. Thus, contrary to some suggestions in the literature (e.g.
              | Ermischer and Preusche 1992) it may be that the old networks between directors and

text          | union officials are more obstructive than helpful in creating co-operative workplace
              | relations in the privatised firms.
              | Furthermore, the general perception of the workplace relations is correlated with
              | the following questions: the more works councils were involved in strategic planning
              | (r= .35*) or feel sufficiently informed (r= -.38**), the more they perceived a positive
              | relationship with management and the less likely they described management as
              | strengthening its power. Moreover, companies which had not experienced industrial
              | conflicts were more likely to have this harmonious relationship (r= .35*).
              | Furthermore, t-tests found that the more insecure the future of the firm, the more the
              | works council saw the need for harmonious relationships (in the best interest of the
              | workforce). This is a very interesting finding. At first sight one might interpret good
              | relationships with management as coming out of a weak bargaining position of the
              | works council. However, it seems more likely that it means that difficult times bind
              | the two sides together.
              | Finally, t-tests revealed that companies with former managers were more likely
              | to have informal negotiations. This might indicate a legacy of former socialist
              | workplace relations in firms with predominantly former managerial staff, as has been
              | suggested in previous studies (e.g. Ermischer and Preusche 1993). Obviously it is
              | difficult to evaluate at this stage whether this is a temporary or a permanent
              | phenomenon.
              | With regard to the second factor („general views of management“) the overall
              | result is less positive. Management was perceived untrustful and as trying to
              | strengthen its power (t-tests revealed that this is more perceived in financially
              | „secure“ than in „insecure“ firms). In addition, the councillors acknowledged the
              | conflicting interests of employers and unions. If management was perceived to be
              | seeking to strengthen its power, works councils were also more likely to perceive
              | union–employer relations as antagonistic (r= .31*). However, t-tests did not reveal a
              | significant difference between private and state ownership with regard to perceptions
              | of different interests.
              | In sum, it seems that although the works councillors were convinced of the
              | desirability of harmonious relations, and were willing to do its part, they realised that
              | management was sometimes less willing to co-operate, and they perceived a
              | difference of interests of both sides.
              | Regarding the second part of the questionnaire, works councils were described
              | primarily as connecting links between management and workforce, thus not as a pure
              | interest representation, and consequently the well-being of the company was seen as
              | of prime importance. This is also a typical phenomenon in West German studies (e.g.
              | Kotthoff 1994) and in line with the legislative objectives (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz).
              | The data also adds support to the argument in the literature that „plant-level

text          | Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?
              | egoism“17 predominates East German works councils (e.g. Lippold et al. 1992;
              | Mahnkopf 1991: 282; 1993: 17).
              | Furthermore, management was seen as pursuing a trustworthy relationship with
              | the workforce, which correlated with the general perception of good workplace
              | relations (r= .68**) and with works councils being described as a connecting link
              | between management and workforce (r= .32*). Interestingly, the higher the share of
              | females in the workforce, the more management was perceived as fostering a trustful
              | relation with the workforce (r= .50**), and the works councils as a connecting link
              | (r= .31*). However there was no significant difference between private and state
              | owned firms with regard to management's relationship to the workforce.
              | Finally, the workforce was perceived as supporting the works council, especially
              | in firms employing few former directors. Thus, the councillors argued that workplace
              | relations are generally better in firms with new management than with the old
              | directors. Yet, the workforce is said to support the works council more in firms with
              | new management. One could follow that the works council saw privatisation and new
              | management as favourable conditions, whereas the workforce might have more them-
              | and-us feelings towards the new management (and therefore supports their interest
              | representation stronger).

              | The sample of the unionised workforce18 contained 70% females, 25% present
              | or past works council members, 8% union officials, 17% who declared themselves as
              | formerly active union members, and 75% blue collar workers. The sample slightly
              | underrepresents women textile workers and overrepresents works council members
              | and union officials. The author has no information on the representativeness of the
              | age distribution for textile companies in this area.19 Table 2 presents the items of
              | workers' perceptions of the instrumentality (effectiveness) of works councils and of
              | workers' willingness to actively support works councils.
              | The overall importance of works councils was widely acknowledged. The
              | comparison between the BGL (former socialist union branch at shopfloor level) and
              | the works council received more divided answers, but still more than a half preferred
              | the works council. With regard to members' perception of works council effectiveness
              | in dealing with specific workplace issues, the results were nearly equally split in
              | positive and negative perceptions, but with slightly more emphasis on the negative
              | side. However, one should note that people were not being asked here their overall
              | views on being represented by their works council. There were no significant

              | Discussion
              | Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?
              | The findings of the works councillor questionnaire contribute to two
              | propositions of the literature reviewed. Firstly, they cannot support the widespread
              | claim of researchers that workplace relations were more antagonistic or that the
              | works council was pushed to the sidelines after privatisation. Clearly, this data is a
              | „snap shot“, not longitudinal and thus does not provide information on possible
              | changes before and after privatisation. Furthermore, the small sample and the limited
              | number of questions do not allow a final judgement on the quality of works council-
              | management relations. However, the data gives a first indication that the current
              | relationship in these firms, which are mostly privatised, was generally harmonious.
              | Thus, the data adds support to the argument of „co-management“ by the WISOC
              | group (e.g. Ermischer and Preusche 1992). Moreover, it challenges the argument that
              | co-management is at risk in firms after privatisation (e.g. Ermischer and Preusche
              | 1995: 59), and that privatisation is likely to cause a polarisation between the two
              | sides (e.g. Kern and Land 1991). In contrast, the data revealed that co-operation was
              | more likely where there were „new“ managers and „new“ works councillors. A rather
              | straightforward interpretation for this perhaps surprising finding is that the old
              | relations between directors and worker representatives were highly distrustful and
              | conflictual and privatisation enabled „fresh blood“ to make a new start. This assumes
              | that both sides perceive co-operative relations as worthwhile (the councillors
              | acknowledged this).
              | Secondly, the findings oppose the fears of some researchers (especially the
              | Berlin/Göttingen group) that works councils are powerless „extended arms of
              | management“. Although the councillors in this sample are obviously not „conflictual,
              | class conscious works councils“ and strongly antagonistic (see Kotthoff's typology
              | above), they are very aware of the different interests of capital and labour and also of
              | the power balance within the firm and do not necessarily trust management. Thus,
              | they surely do not represent Kotthoff's „deficient“ types of works councils (isolated,
              | ignored, extended arm of management), but more his „effective“ types, in particular
              | the „respected, co- operative“ works council. In other words, the data supports more
              | the hypothesis of co-operative relationships than that of a one-sided acquiescence on
              | the part of the works councils. However, the survey certainly does not allow any final
              | conclusion regarding the practical effectiveness of the works councils' interest
              | representation, and therefore the categorisation can be only speculative. The real
              | effectiveness of these councils is better to be explored by methods such as non-
              | participative observation or interviews with the workforce or by the workforce
              | questionnaires. However, the finding that the works councils felt strongly supported
              | by the workforce might be a first indicator of the works councils' functioning and
              | indeed its effectiveness.
              | With regard to the membership questionnaire the three major findings are firstly
              | the overall acceptance of the works council as a necessary institution, and a clear
              | preference for the new interest institution. This also confirms the preliminary
              | Industrielle Beziehungen, 4. Jg., Heft 3, 1997
meta          | 211
text          | suggestion in the works council questionnaire, that works councils saw themselves
              | being accepted by their workforce.
              | The second major result refers to the divided views on the works council's actual
              | work. One needs to address how this finding relates to the hypothesis in the literature
              | that workers are highly disillusioned over the effectiveness of works councils (with
              | respect to the redundancies, co-management etc.). Workers were realistic about the
              | limited resources of works councils in these economic circumstances. This might be
              | disappointing, yet it did not lead people to reject the institution as such. In short,
              | although the findings do not suggest highly effective and powerful institutions,
              | workers conclude that this is related more to the external conditions than to the design
              | of the institution as such. One should add that this result might be biased by the fact
              | that only union members were asked. However, this survey was also distributed to
              | non-union members in the largest firm of our sample and the results for this firm did
              | not reveal any significant differences between non-union members and members in
              | this respect (see Frege 1996a, chp. 9). In sum, the data adds support to the more
              | positive studies about workers' attitudes towards the works council, such as Heering
              | and Schroeder (1992) who found that 76% of their sample had a positive attitude
              | towards their works council (the precise question is however not published); and
              | challenges pessimistic studies such as Jander et al. (1992). Moreover, the large-scale
              | survey, DGB Trendbarometer (IFEP 1994) which surveys a representative sample of
              | the German working population (employed and unemployed) every other year (since
              | 1992 in the East and West), on their attitudes towards interest institutions, shows that
              | a majority of East German employees value the works councils' work in 1994 slightly
              | more than in 1992, although they were still more critical than in the West: in 1994
              | 32% of East Germans valued the work (46% West Germans), 30% marked it
              | negatively (25%). In particular, our data is more positive than the DGB results for the
              | GTB (West and East): These were in 1992 considerably below the DGB German
              | average with only 6% approving the works council's work (no separate data for
              | 1994). However 59% did not answer and the sample consisted of only 83 persons,
              | which questions the data's reliability.21
              | Finally, the third result refers to members' strong willingness to participate in
              | certain works council activities and their conviction that workers' support is a
              | necessary condition for works councils' effectiveness. This underlines workers'
              | acceptance of the new institution and a conviction of its basic instrumentality.
              | Besides, the data supports an established western theory that members are far easier
              | to mobilize for selective collective actions than for continuous voluntary
              | commitments. A similar distinction has also been found in the questions on union
              | participation (see Frege 1996b) and also in West German studies. For example,
              | Wiedenhofer (1979: 44) found 20% willing members to stand for works council
              | election, the Sozialreport (1993: 30) found 23% willing to become active for „worker

              | of their union sample
              | 7.
              | Conclusion
              | Neither survey can provide the in-depth analysis of workplace relations that
              | intensive case studies can provide. On the other hand it is rare to see relatively large
              | samples of works councils and unionized workers being examined together, and this
              | in an industrial sector which is normally neglected in such an area of research.
              | In a nutshell the works councillor data presented co-operative attitudes towards
              | management, in particular in firms with „new“ managers and „new“ councillors.
              | However, the councillors were cautious in trusting management and critical about
              | management's willingness to co-operate. They also did not perceive themselves as
              | extended arms of management. Overall, it seems safe to say that co-operation might
              | well be founded on the new transferred industrial relations institutions rather than
              | being a legacy of the socialist times.
              | Moreover, works councillors did not seem to neglect their representative tasks,
              | as has been proposed in various studies (e.g. Jander and Lutz 1991; Kädtler and
              | Kottwitz 1994). This is supported by the worker survey. The data reveals that,
              | although successes were critically evaluated, workers were aware of the desperate
              | economic situation limiting works council's possibilities. Thus the limited
              | effectiveness of works councils did not prejudice people's acceptance, legitimisation
              | and support of the new institutions (contrary to Jander et al. 1992). The works
              | councils were widely accepted as a necessary and important interest institution at
              | workplace level.
              | In sum, both data sets support Kotthoff's category of an effective, respected and
              | co-operative works council (which was also the major category in his West German
              | study). This finding might stir up first doubts about the conclusion of some literature
              | (e.g. Mense-Petermann 1996) that qualitatively different workplace relations
              | becoming established in the East Germany (compared to the West). In addition, the
              | data also indicates a successful „institutionalisation“ of the works council. Thus, not
              | only were the works councils formally installed but also the „substantive“ or
              | „normative“ establishment was successful in terms of the acceptance, legitimisation
              | and support of the actors, i.e. workers, involved. This result stands in strong contrast
              | to that of studies which emphasize the lack of workers' support for works councils
              | and which postulate that the works councils have not yet been successfully
              | institutionalised (e.g. Jander and Lutz 1993; Mahnkopf 1991: 280 pp; Lippold et al.
              | 1992: 92; Spangenberg 1993: 20). Finally, this data provides a first indication that the
              | current problems of the East German works councils are far more likely to be caused
              | by structural factors (i.e. recession, restructuring of the industry) than by internal
              | factors (i.e. institutional deficiencies, lacking support of workforce) or indeed
              | management strategies.
