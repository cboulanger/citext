              | Uganda: The Mabira Forest Case
              | Patrick Hönig
              | Abstract: Over the past few years, the Ugandan government has repeat-
              | edly initiated proceedings to clear one-fourth of the Mabira natural forest
              | reserve in central Uganda and give the land to a sugar company con-
              | trolled by a transnational business conglomerate. Each time the govern-
              | ment took steps to execute the Mabira project, civil society groups or-
              | ganised large-scale protests that pressurised the government into shelving
              | its plans. The Save Mabira Forest campaign has been widely cited as an
              | example of how sustained protests by civil society groups serve as a
              | corrective of democratic deficits in decision-making processes pertaining
              | to the commons and as a deterrent to profit-driven business schemes
              | hatched in collusion with carefree or corrupt bureaucrats and politicians.
              | However, an in-depth analysis of the campaign suggests that ecological
              | and social justice concerns are mixed up with identity politics and exclu-
              | sionist agendas. Examining the complex web of interactions between
              | state, big business and civil society in Uganda, this paper sheds light on
              | the multi-layered and often ambiguous role played by non-governmental
              | organisations in post-conflict societies of sub-Saharan Africa.

              | There is a growing consensus that policy-making on the use of the
              | commons – land, air and water – requires a careful calibration of envi-
              | ronmental, developmental and political concerns. However, as Polack
              | and others (2013: 1-7) have noted, large-scale acquisition of land by
              | transnational companies operating in Africa continues to occur with
              | “minimal consultation and transparency”. There are significant research
              | gaps in the way long-term effects of land allotment for agro-industrial
              | use are assessed, which in turn leads to less stringent risk assessment.
              | Authors such as Muna Ndulo (2011) have convincingly shown that the
              | adoption of neoliberal policies in aid-dependent countries of sub-Sa-
              | haran Africa has created a political climate that allows corporations to
              | push through their agendas, sometimes even at the cost of violating legal
              | standards and human rights. At the same time, there is growing recogni-
              | tion that civil society groups in sub-Saharan Africa have started to assert
              | themselves at the policy-making level and fill a governance void left by
              | states prepared to delegate their responsibilities (Opoku-Mensah 2008).
              | Against that background, governance of the commons has become an
              | important area in which opposing interests play out and clash.
              | Pointing to governance as the core problem of dealing with the
              | commons, Elinor Ostrom (1990: 8-18) observes that there is a wide spec-
              | trum of opinions. On one side, analysts have argued that effective man-
              | agement of the commons requires long-term strategies that private actors
              | adapting to ever-changing market conditions are ill-equipped to bring to
              | fruition. Ostrom notes that this school of thought sees no alternative to
              | state institutions applying coercive force in governing the commons.
              | Meanwhile, those at the other end of the spectrum claim that it is neces-
              | sary to eliminate all public control and establish unconditional property
              | rights regimes over divisible common pool resources such as land. The
              | ramifications of the various positions, including Ostrum’s own viewpoint
              | that builds on the notion that “many solutions exist to cope with many
              | different problems”, will need to be discussed elsewhere. For the pur-
              | poses of this paper, it will suffice to note that there has been considera-
              | ble research into developing models of governance in areas of limited
              | statehood, centring on the structural and political conditions in which
              | power is generated and decisions are formed (Risse 2011). Academic
              | writing has moved beyond binaries pitting state against non-state actors.
              | Using the Save Mabira Forest (SMF) campaign in Uganda as a case
              | study, this paper seeks to make an empirical contribution to the largely
              | theoretical discussion about the nature of the state and civil society in
              | sub-Saharan Africa and the processes of political decision-making. It will

              | findings to the discourse on governing the commons. The engagement
              | with media reports and scholarly work is balanced by background inter-
              | views on the functioning of civil society that I conducted in Uganda and
              | neighbouring countries during field trips in five consecutive years start-
              | ing in 2008.1
              | The Mabira Forest Project
              | In early 2007, the Ugandan government announced that it would dega-
              | zette and clear one-quarter of Mabira Central Forest Reserve – the larg-
              | est nature reserve in Central Uganda – and give the land to the Sugar
              | Corporation of Uganda Ltd (SCOUL), jointly owned by a private in-
              | vestor and the Ugandan state, to cultivate sugarcane. Ugandan President
              | Yoweri Museveni justified this decision on the grounds that the country
              | needed to expand its agricultural and industrial sectors, create incentives
              | for foreign direct investment and boost the economy.2 A letter that the
              | president had allegedly written to MPs of his party was leaked to the
              | press, presumably by his own office. In the letter, the authenticity of
              | which the presidency never confirmed or denied, Museveni gave a three-
              | fold explanation for the proposed leasing out of Mabira land. First, he
              | argued that granting land to SCOUL would create jobs. Second, he
              | maintained that the success of the country’s economy depended on the
              | Ugandan Asian business community, which had been expelled under Idi
              | Amin and the reinstatement of which had been a central concern of his
              | government from the beginning. Third, he claimed that in order for
              | businesses in Uganda to compete with China, India and other developing
              | countries, they had to lower costs and expand. In the case at hand, forest

              | land had to be given away, according to the president, as no other land
              | was available.3
              | Museveni’s line of argument follows a neoliberal logic holding that
              | what is good for business is good for the country. There appears to be
              | no place in his thinking for the concerns of local communities, which are
              | so vital for sustainable development centred on the protection of the
              | commons. Baden and Stroup (1977: 235) sum up the tension resulting
              | from the impossibility of quantifying the value of using the commons for
              | non-extractive purposes as follows: “We know, for example, how much
              | people are willing to sacrifice for a thousand board feet of lumber, but
              | how much would they pay for a day’s access to a wilderness area?” The
              | Ugandan government’s path dependency explains why it is unwilling to
              | consider leaving Mabira Forest alone, for no other reason than preserv-
              | ing an untouched part of nature.
              | Countering such criticism, the Ugandan government has argued that
              | the part of Mabira Forest being allocated to private concession either
              | does not belong to the natural forest or belongs to a degraded part of it.
              | However, the government has not addressed reports indicating that
              | illegal logging is being carried out alongside the logging for which con-
              | cession has been granted. In 2012, sources on the ground informed that
              | twenty lorry loads of illegally logged timber were being hauled from
              | Mabira on a weekly basis.4 Even if the extent of illegal logging is hard to
              | verify independently, it is difficult to deny that it is indeed happening.
              | Satellite images of Mabira Forest, taken periodically from 1972 to 2003,
              | show a significant decrease of forest cover in the area (Lung and Schaab
              | 2008: 28). Any further deforestation is likely to irreparably damage an
              | ecosystem already under stress. Deborah Baranga (2007: 2) claims that
              | uncontrolled exploitation and illegal timber extraction pose a major
              | threat to Mabira Forest, which is why there is a need to investigate the
              | current activities in the reserve and their effect on its conservation status.
              | In this section, we have seen that the Ugandan government advo-
              | cates the handover of Mabira forest land to a private company, a market-
              | oriented tactic. In the next section, we will discuss why civil society or-

              | forest land.
              | The Save Mabira Forest Campaign
              | The Save Mabira Forest (SMF) campaign has gained international visi-
              | bility for opposing the Ugandan government and questioning its stance
              | on governing the commons. The decision to allow SCOUL to take over
              | 7,100 hectares of Mabira Forest met with bitter resistance on the part of
              | a cross-section of public institutions, political actors and CSOs. More
              | awkwardly, even the heads of the National Environment Management
              | Agency (NEMA) and the National Forestry Authority (NFA) rejected
              | the government proposals as ecologically imprudent, arguing that the
              | environmental impact of cutting trees in an area more than twenty times
              | the size of Central Park in Manhattan was likely going to be significant
              | (Price 2007). The NFA executive director, and later the entire board,
              | resigned over the Mabira issue, citing political interference.
              | The SMF campaign soon turned into a mass mobilisation of unprec-
              | edented scale, pitting the Ugandan government against a range of CSOs,
              | international donors, the political opposition, the Buganda kingdom and
              | significant segments of civil society. Museveni eventually shelved his plans
              | for Mabira Forest but put the issue back on the political agenda in Au-
              | gust 2011, a few months after winning his fourth term in office and
              | cementing his two-and-a-half-decade-long hold on power. As had hap-
              | pened in 2007, a network of civil society groups launched a campaign for
              | the preservation of Mabira Forest. The campaign gathered momentum
              | when young Ugandans started using social networking sites like Face-
              | book and Twitter to organise, among other things, nature walks in the
              | forest, which, at approximately 50 km from Kampala and 20 km from
              | Jinja, is easy to reach, even by public transport. In September 2011, Ma-
              | hendra Mehta, the head of Mehta Group, was quoted as saying that he
              | was no longer interested in acquiring part of the Mabira Forest for sug-
              | arcane growing.5 Tensions eased, but the calm again proved deceptive.
              | At a party retreat in January 2013, without prior indication, Muse-
              | veni announced that he would follow through on his plans for Mabira.

              | sition politician who is perceived as the figurehead of the movement,
              | went on record saying that the government would not be allowed to
              | divert attention from the challenges the country was facing, and the fight
              | for Mabira Forest would continue.6
              | Ugandan researchers and international observers have interpreted
              | the massive show of support for the anti-deforestation campaign as a
              | sign of growing civil society assertiveness in a country with a history of
              | authoritarian regimes and political repression. Bashir Twesigye (2008: 7)
              | expressed the view that the Mabira advocacy campaign reflected in-
              | creasing environmental awareness and the determination of the Ugandan
              | people to oppose misguided government policies. In line with liberal
              | streams of analysis, Keith Child (2009: 241) called the SMF campaign a
              | “powerful demonstration” of how civil society movements with a limited
              | agenda may transform themselves into platforms that put forward “more
              | radical demands for democratic accountability”. Similarly, Aili Tripp
              | (2010: 105) wrote that the response to the cutting down of trees in Ma-
              | bira Forest was a showcase of how civil society in sub-Saharan Africa
              | had woken up to the challenges that threaten human survival, notably
              | the protection of the environment.
              | However, the opposition against the Mabira Forest project is no
              | monolithic bloc. Even though it is widely portrayed as the outcome of
              | concerted action against pro-business land use policies, the SMF cam-
              | paign is composed of a variety of groups whose mandates overlap and
              | whose interests conflict. The first pillar of the SMF campaign consists of
              | a cluster of environmental groups, which argue that the conversion of
              | forest land into a sugarcane plantation will spell environmental disaster
              | for its adverse effects on biodiversity, fresh water supply, soil fertility and
              | carbon reduction, harming ecotourism in the process.7 Building on a
              | growing movement for the preservation of forests in Africa, the late

              | mechanism to support responsible global warming mitigation efforts”
              | (2009: 257). Moreover, Mabira Forest constitutes an important catch-
              | ment area and its partial deforestation will further diminish fresh water
              | supplies to Lake Kyoga and the Victoria Nile. Lake Victoria, the biggest
              | water reserve in the Great Lakes region, has already seen a steady decline
              | in water levels over the years, contributing to a hazardous concentration

              | Davenport and others (1996: 4), is home to 71 restricted-range species of
              | birds, butterflies and moths. Furthermore, some environmentalists claim
              | that cutting down one-fourth of the Mabira Forest will translate into a
              | loss of USD 316 million worth of UN-certified carbon credit.8
              | The SMF campaign has drawn further support from a range of left-
              | ist groups, which oppose international investment in agro-industrial
              | business in developing countries on economic and ideological grounds.
              | According to these groups, the idea that business companies adopt strat-
              | egies that keep society’s best interests in mind has been discredited in
              | light of neo-liberal policies that consider community land as a commod-
              | ity for sale. Samir Amin (2010), a staunch critic of the Washington con-
              | sensus, asserts that subjecting land to the “law of the market” uproots
              | people and, contrary to the arguments of supporters of privatisation
              | policies, exacerbates poverty. While the use of forest reserve land for
              | agro-industrial purposes does not in itself lead to displacement, it nev-
              | ertheless forms part of an economic paradigm that comes to its logical
              | conclusion in what Amin calls the “destruction of the peasant societies”,
              | which he believes is a major cause of the pauperisation of the Third
              | World. In a study on the impact that the Mabira project has had on pov-
              | erty alleviation, Zommers and others (2012: 190-192) conclude that be-
              | fore expanding sugarcane production into forest reserves, the Ugandan
              | government will act responsibly only if it carefully evaluates the im-
              | portance of ecosystem services to local livelihood, which so far it has
              | failed to do. More generally, Mabira activists may draw support from
              | arguments developed by thinkers such as Rob Gray, who argues that
              | corporations are a force against social justice. The logic behind such
              | thinking is that corporations are pursuing the goal of maximising wealth

              | the concept of material redistribution, which lies at the heart of social
              | justice (Gray 2013: 162-163). Therefore, for left-leaning anti-poverty
              | campaigners, Mabira is an open-and-shut case.
              | The third plank on which the Mabira protest rests is composed of a
              | rainbow coalition of watchdog groups that base their criticism on a vari-
              | ety of concerns, including corruption charges. The Advocates Coalition
              | for Development and Environment (ACODE), for instance, laments
              | that the government has failed to invite offers from Mehta’s business
              | competitors or call for tender.9 The waters are further muddied by the
              | fact that the land deal with Mehta Group is far from transparent. There
              | is no information about how the Ugandan exchequer stands to benefit
              | from the proposed transaction. The media is rife with speculation that
              | once the land deal is complete, the government will part with its 30 per
              | cent stake in SCOUL, for a price, leaving in charge Mehta Group, a
              | business conglomerate that operates in four continents and holds assets
              | in excess of USD 400 million.10 Unsurprisingly, a recent policy briefing
              | listed the envisaged sale of forest land in Mabira as one of several exam-
              | ples of how the ruling coalition in Uganda is being bought off by big
              | business (Kjær and Katusiimeh 2012: 27). In terms of social acceptance,
              | it does not help that SCOUL is the least productive of the three major
              | sugar producers in Uganda and reportedly incurring substantial losses.
              | The fourth tributary to the SMF campaign is made up by supporters
              | of the Kabaka, the king of Buganda, who believes the forest is part of
              | “Buganda land” and should be preserved in its entirety. It is important to
              | recall that Museveni’s capture of power in 1986 is largely seen as the
              | result of his alliance with the Buganda movement, which supported his

              | in 2009, and the destruction, in mysterious circumstances, of the Kasubi

              | the Kabaka his place, which further raises suspicion about the existence
              | of hidden agendas.
              | In sum, the SMF campaign draws its significance both from an ar-
              | ticulation of a rainbow coalition of civil society voices in a public dis-
              | course centred on government action, and from serving as an example of
              | a social movement that breaks with the tradition of party movements,
              | from which the current multi-party system in Uganda has developed. A
              | brief overview of the history of engagement with the idea of the state in
              | the postcolonial world, and the concept of civil society within and
              | around it, will help place the SMF campaign on the matrix of political
              | practices in the governance context of sub-Saharan Africa.
              | State Crisis in Uganda
              | The Mabira Forest agitation is one of only a handful of political cam-
              | paigns that have been able to attract interest and support from large
              | segments of the Ugandan public over a period of several years. The suc-
              | cess of the SMF campaign, as well as its shortcomings, will not be easily
              | understood unless placed in the context of a debate on the state and its
              | decline in sub-Saharan Africa. After its independence in 1962, Uganda
              | witnessed short-lived coalition governments, single-party rule, Idi Amin’s
              | tyranny and a series of wars that ended with the takeover of power by
              | Museveni and his National Resistance Army in 1986. Some authors have
              | described the Uganda of the 1990s as a country that, unlike the Demo-
              | cratic Republic of the Congo, had pulled itself back from the brink of a
              | “failed state” and managed to break through the logic of violent conflict
              | to initiate processes of “negotiation and rebuilding” (Bayart et al. 1999: 5;
              | Crawford 2004: 47). Such a reading of Ugandan history tends to down-
              | play the disastrous consequences of the civil war of the 1980s and the
              | significant fallout from the subsequent war in northern Uganda that

              | der suspected war criminal Joseph Kony. Moses Khisa (2013: 201) ar-
              | gues that what gave rise to the current conception of the state in Uganda
              | can be traced to the trauma of prolonged tyranny and civil war that re-
              | sulted, first, in a pronounced urge for minimum stability and personal
              | security among the population at large, and, second, in a strong belief
              | among the ruling elites that militaristic methods of managing society will
              | pay off.
              | Soon after taking over power, Museveni was faced with a military
              | threat to his leadership and a budget crisis exacerbated by increasing
              | military expenditures. He responded by performing a U-turn from non-
              | aligned rhetoric and, under pressure from the Bretton Woods institu-
              | tions, embraced neoliberal reforms through structural adjustment pro-
              | grammes. Uganda adopted policies of market liberalisation, privatisation
              | and deregulation, and started to downsize its civil service and roll back
              | the state generally. The implementation of such measures required a
              | political rigidity that contradicted the call for “liberalisation” in any sense
              | other than economic and flew in the face of civil society’s requests for
              | democratic consultation and accountability. An authoritarian streak soon
              | accompanied Uganda’s transition to free-market politics (Crawford 2004:
              | 42; Olukoshi 2007: 18). Museveni’s acceptance of the neoliberal straight-
              | jacket imposed by the Washington Consensus made him a regional “donor
              | darling” and gave him considerable leeway to consolidate his power at the
              | expense of competitive politics. This may well have reinforced his “per-
              | sonalistic politics” and stifled the emergence of a legitimate opposition
              | strong enough to challenge him in free and fair elections (Hesselbein et al.
              | 2006: 30; Mamdani 1994: 557). The results are plain to see. The 2006
              | presidential elections were reduced to a contest between Museveni and his
              | main rival Kizza Besigye. Upon his return to Uganda from exile in 2005,
              | Besigye had first been held on charges of treason and rape, then, when he
              | moved to apply for bail, on charges of terrorism (Oloka-Onyango
              | 2006: 43). Although Besigye eventually stood in the elections, the impact
              | of the allegations against him probably doused his chances of winning
              | before his campaign could take off.
              | In the lead-up to presidential elections in 2011, Sabiti Makara (2010:
              | 91) warned that there was little to indicate a shift from the deeply-rooted
              | “reluctance to promote and deepen multiparty democracy” in Uganda.
              | As an example, Makara cited the role of the Electoral Commission,
              | which he said was widely suspected to be catering to the wishes of the
              | ruling party. Others echoed such scepticism about the democratic cre-
              | dentials of the Ugandan polity. Olive Kobusingye (2010: 193) stated that

              | National Resistance Movement came to power, she argued that the sheen
              | of elections had worn off over time. In her view, elections can no longer
              | be considered a means of choosing a leader of the people’s choice.11 Con-
              | cern over securitisation, de-politicisation and erosion of democratic proce-
              | dures is routinely expressed in conversations about the state of affairs in
              | Uganda.
              | Ugandan civil society groups, such as Advocates Coalition for De-
              | velopment and Environment and Human Rights Network Uganda, have
              | been consistent in their criticism of a wide range of government policies.
              | Human Rights Watch (2010, 2011) published a report on intimidation
              | and harassment of the media in Uganda, followed by another on the
              | practice of torture and illegal detention by Uganda’s Rapid Response
              | Unit. On the 2011 elections, the European Union Election Observation
              | Mission (2011: 5-7) noted that the electoral process had been “marred by
              | avoidable administrative and logistical failures”, leading to the disen-
              | franchisement of an “unacceptable number of Ugandan citizens”.12 Em-
              | boldened by the 2011 election results, Museveni started clamping down
              | on the political opposition with renewed vigour. Tellingly, the massive
              | police crackdown on the “walk-to-work” campaign, which the political
              | opposition had organised in Kampala to protest rising living expenses,
              | coincided with the democratic uprising in a variety of capitals in North
              | Africa and West Asia.
              | Before long, the debate had focused on whether Uganda could be
              | described as a neopatrimonial state, which Paul Williams (2011: 56) has
              | characterised as hybrid, unstable and shot through with streaks of au-
              | thoritarianism. However, the limitations of the neopatrimonial label, a
              | universal catch-all classification, soon became apparent. State features
              | differ from region to region, and it cannot be said that every state that is
              | hybrid is unstable or that every state that is unstable is authoritarian in
              | nature. Against that background, Erdmann and Engel (2007: 104-105)

              | loses all meaning. Providing an in-depth analysis of the literature, they
              | consider the “invasion” of informal politics and personal relations into
              | the formal structures of legal-rational reasoning as the core element of
              | the neopatrimonial state. In other words, some features of the formal-
              | bureaucratic Weberian state continue to function, while others are being
              | eroded and fall prey to competing networks of informal power. Similarly,
              | Daniel Bach (2012: 35, 44) observes that the concept of neopatrimonial
              | rule has become equated with predatory, anti-developmental and person-
              | alised power, while regulated forms of power have been overlooked or
              | side-tracked. It makes sense to view the essence of neopatrimonialism not
              | in the usurping by individuals of power assigned to constitutional organs,
              | but in the mixing of competing layers of decision-making, formal and
              | informal, resulting in erratic functioning of state institutions and clashes of
              | power formations with unpredictable outcomes. The way decisions on the
              | Mabira Forest have been made and revoked in a haphazard and incoherent
              | way, without any procedures being followed, fits this definition of neopat-
              | rimonialism.
              | Meanwhile, the launch of structural adjustment programmes de-
              | vised by Bretton Woods institutions since the 1980s has been accompa-
              | nied by talk of the informal state, the predatory state, the shadow state or
              | even the vampire state. According to Khisa (2013: 212), Uganda presents
              | an interesting departure from the phenomenon of shadow states that rely
              | on clandestine economy networks amidst collapsing state institutions.
              | Khisa argues that the defining feature of the state in Uganda is donorisa-
              | tion, the result of which is the emergence of a CSO economy fuelled by
              | Western aid and loans. While the state is stripped of many of its core
              | functions, CSOs are being given extensive mandates to implement edu-
              | cation, infrastructure, environment protection and health care pro-
              | grammes. Such analysis ties in with left-leaning criticism of the disman-
              | tling of the state by free market forces. Achille Mbembe (2001: 74-75)
              | recalls that the “African crisis” of the 1980s originated from the state
              | placing excessive demands on the economy. Based on the argument that
              | recovery from such crisis depended on strengthening free market forces,
              | measures were put in place to restrict state intervention in the economy
              | without introducing safeguards in key sectors such as health, education
              | and protection of the environment. Predictably, the results were not all
              | positive. For example, Uganda’s draconian “anti-homosexuality act”,
              | which has received strong support from evangelist groups based in the
              | United States, shows that pro-business strategies in line with policies
              | formulated by Bretton Woods institutions do not necessarily translate
              | Civil Society and Land Use Policy in Uganda
meta          | 65
text          | into a liberal vision for society.13 The changing dynamics in the interac-
              | tion of state and civil society actors will be at the centre of the following
              | section.
              | Ascendency of Civil Society
              | One section of the literature believes that the only way to fix the broken
              | state, neopatrimonial or otherwise, is to develop strategies to stop the
              | erosion of state legitimacy, preferably by involving informal CSO coali-
              | tions, watchdog groups and informed citizens. Informed citizens and
              | watchdog groups formed by such citizens are regarded as an embattled
              | but important safeguard for democratic institution-building in Uganda, a
              | corrective to policies devised by authoritarian regimes (Kasfir 1999).
              | Recalling that none of Africa’s newly established multi-party regimes
              | have abandoned presidential for parliamentary rule, Nicolas van de Walle
              | (2012: 121) considers the curtailing of presidential prerogatives through
              | mechanisms of vertical and horizontal accountability to essentially be a
              | task incumbent on democratic movements emerging from authoritarian
              | traditions. Broadening the frame of analysis beyond national borders,
              | Andreas Godsäter (2013: 68) asserts that, for the sake of legitimate and

              | cooperation at the regional level, and adopt environmental rules and
              | regulations governing cross-border relations. From an international rela-
              | tions perspective, Ulrich Beck (1999: 17) compares civil society move-
              | ments to a “world party” that places “globality at the heart of political
              | imagination, action and organisation” and appeals “to human values and
              | traditions in every culture and religion”. Beck also feels that naming-and-

              | persuade corporations to comply with international law and corporate
              | social responsibility schemes.

              | society diverging radically from those nurtured by actors in northern
              | countries. Taking a similarly sober position on the capacity or willingness
              | of CSOs to advance liberal agendas, Hovil and Okello (2011: 336) re-
              | mind us that civil society groups, like state agents, are susceptible to
              | usurping authority that they cannot legitimately claim and act as “anticor-

              | CSOs as the last line of defence against state suppression and the guard-
              | ian angels of constitutional values – irrespective of their sometimes con-
              | tradictory views and ideological aberrations – makes it all the more diffi-

              | same lack of internal democracy, transparency and gender equality as the
              | state actors they find reason to criticise.
              | Mindful of the political economy of civil society activity, another
              | segment of the literature takes a more critical approach and makes a
              | point of analysing the organisational capacity of watchdog groups to live
              | up to their mission statements, measuring rhetoric against performance.
              | Playing out in variations, these observers argue that CSOs in semi-
              | authoritarian sub-Saharan African countries may be well-meaning but are
              | confused about their mandate, alienated from their constituencies, given
              | to believing in the power of just talking, weakened by infighting and co-
              | opted by either the state or international donors (Barr et al. 2005: 664-
              | 665; Omona and Mukuye 2013; Opoku-Mensah 2008: 80-83; Tripp
              | 2010: 30). Shedding light on the structural constraints of civil society
              | activism, Miller and others (2013: 136) have noted that CSOs are perma-
              | nently trapped between “a desire to enhance community well-being and
              | an inability to shape the context in which to do so”. Even where a conten-
              | tious civil society has emerged – “strong, well networked and capable of
              | proposal as well as protest” – independent decision-making is constantly
              | imperilled by a shortage of funds and the need for CSOs to operate in a
              | national context governed by laws and regulations that have a bearing on
              | their activities (ibid. 141-143). This seam of research offers explanations
              | for why civil society movements, particularly in Africa, tend to be eclec-
              | tic and short-lived; however, it fails to explain why protests erupt when
              | they do and why people give their time and money to campaigns when
              | they have no reassurance that they will receive anything in return.

              | “post-colonial misrule” in sub-Saharan Africa have proven that Africans
              | themselves do not know what kind of governance works for them. He
              | adds that the regimes that have made the “best fist of a difficult situa-
              | tion” have been those in countries such as Uganda, which are “neither
              | liberal nor democratic but simply have relatively farsighted and honest, if
              | authoritarian, leadership”. Alex Thomson (2010: 232) describes a notice-
              | able trend towards chaos and disintegration of existing power structures
              | as the flipside of civil society ascendancy in the post-colonial African
              | state. This is the context in which we need to place Dambisa Moyo’s
              | controversial call for a “decisive benevolent dictator” in aid-dependent
              | Africa, where leaderships demand nothing from the public at large and
              | are not required to give anything in return (Moyo 2010 [2009]: 42).
              | However, if solutions are sought from centralised decision-making, ra-
              | ther than the building of consensus around diverse voices, civil society
              | groups will hardly be considered as significant, or even useful, players in
              | the larger scheme of things. Buying into this logic, the Ugandan govern-
              | ment maintains that CSOs are not to be trusted because they are funded
              | by “the West” and also because they are opposition parties in disguise,
              | bent on defaming the country (Human Rights Watch 2012: 20).
              | The next section examines the question of how the racial overtones
              | of the agitation impact the conceptualisation of civil society in Uganda
              | and the framing of the debate on Mabira Forest.
              | Governing the Commons
              | As discussed earlier, the Mabira Forest movement does not result from a
              | single concern shared by all. Rather, it is fed by a wide range of groups
              | with agendas as complex and multi-layered as Ugandan society itself.
              | Cutting across debates on development, social justice and environmental
              | protection, the Mabira Forest case serves as a magnifying glass under
              | which an array of problems pertaining to resource management come
              | into focus. Whether the SMF campaign is cited as an example of civil
              | society resistance to government folly or interference in sound policy-
              | making depends largely on the criteria used to evaluate the agitation on
              | its merits. Fischlin and Nandorfy (2012: 89) argue that in devising re-
              | gimes governing the commons, individual rights, such as the right to
              | property, need to be balanced against “community rights”; in other
              | words, the “rights of community commons to exist and be protected”.
              | At the heart of such a balancing test lies a re-orientation towards an
              | understanding of community and rights centring on “interests shaped by

              | the most basic practices that guarantee sustainable life”, such as food,
              | water, shelter and respect for difference. The conceptual connection of
              | resource governance and community-building explains the importance of
              | addressing the racial overtones of the SMF campaign.
              | From its early days, the Save Mabira agitation provided cover for
              | free-riders who launched attacks on Ugandan Asians on the rationale
              | that they were to be collectively held responsible for the business activi-
              | ties of the Indian-owned Mehta group, a transnational corporation that
              | holds the majority stake in SCOUL. In response to what came to be
              | known as the “Mabira riots”, Museveni declared that his decision to
              | allocate part of the Mabira Forest to SCOUL was non-negotiable. How-
              | ever, the conclusions he drew from the outbreak of violence were un-
              | convincing. Apart from holding a meeting with the Ugandan Asian
              | community in Kampala, in which he reassured them of government
              | protection, Museveni struck a clearly populist chord, blaming the police
              | for allowing the demonstration that had led to the casualties, announcing
              | tax breaks for investors and calling for tougher laws on the media.14 The
              | organisers of the Mabira protests, on the other hand, claimed their dem-
              | ocratic right to assemble freely and peacefully but failed to decisively
              | distance themselves from the violence against Ugandan Asians and draw
              | a line between environmental concern and racism.
              | The repeated outbreak of violence targeting Ugandan Asians sug-
              | gests that, under the guise of ecological and social justice concerns, a
              | band of operators are exploiting popular anxieties and employing divi-
              | sive tactics for political gain. Tensions along ethnic lines had built up
              | gradually under colonial rule and were deliberately exploited by Idi Amin
              | during his reign of terror from 1971 to 1979. As early as 1972, Amin
              | launched an expropriation and expulsion campaign against Asian Ugan-
              | dans on the grounds that they were “sabotaging Uganda’s economy and
              | encouraging corruption” (Manby 2009: 54, 96). Irreconcilable as his
              | policies were with international human rights standards, it is perhaps
              | important to note that the anti-Asian resentment and the expropriation
              | of their assets and businesses was a safe card to play for Amin as it met
              | with the approval of significant segments of both the Baganda and the
              | increasingly influential Nubi-Muslim trading communities who saw the
              | Asian traders as rivals (Hansen 2013: 91).

              | 1995 that Asians (5,000 lived in Uganda at the time, compared to 70,000
              | before the expulsion, 23,000 of whom were Ugandan citizens) had not
              | lost their image as “cut-throat businessmen”, adding that their “influence
              | in Uganda stretched far beyond their numbers” (The Economist 1995). The
              | Mehta family, which owns the business conglomerate that carries its
              | name, had been forced to leave the country in the 1970s and returned
              | only in the 1990s to reclaim its property. Meanwhile, Museveni’s public
              | remarks about his personal investment priorities have done little to ease
              | ethnic tensions. In an interview with the New African, Museveni said that
              | foreign investors were more useful to the country than some of its do-
              | mestic ones because they created jobs, paid taxes, bought raw materials
              | and paid for the electricity they used.15 Such condescension brings back
              | images of the colonial times. Ugandans have not forgotten that it was a
              | hallmark of the colonial state to introduce crops, decide on the colony’s
              | trading partners and clear forests “without any consideration to envi-
              | ronmental or religious importance” (Mueni wa Muiu 2010: 1314).
              | Given the country’s record of violence against Ugandan Asians, it is
              | somewhat surprising that academic writing has tended to ignore the
              | campaign’s racial undercurrents and the threats they pose for the Ugan-
              | dan polity as a whole. Mahmood Mamdani (2007), himself a Ugandan of
              | Asian descent, wrote that what had made the leasing of land so explosive
              | was the collusion between an increasingly unaccountable president who
              | treated the country as his private preserve, and a tycoon who claimed to
              | be doing the country a favour while lining his own pockets. Mamdani
              | maintained that the political opposition had taken advantage of the situ-
              | ation but had not created the issue, omitting any mention of actors who
              | might have a vested interest in escalating ethnic tensions in Ugandan
              | society. Bashir Twesigye (2008: 6) stated that protesters had turned on
              | people of Indian origin “to demonstrate their disapproval of the Indian
              | owners of Mehta” as if this was an excuse for the violence that unfolded.
              | Keith Child (2009: 251-253) wrote that the attacks on Ugandan Asians of
              | April 2007 had drawn condemnation from many of the civil society
              | groups that helped organise it, which is why analysis of the cause of the
              | agitation and its consequences should be kept separate. However, if we

              | from the ill will towards Ugandan Asians that Child claims is entrenched
              | in Ugandan society. It is perhaps the desire to brand the SMF campaign
              | as a “symbol of civil society efficacy” that makes it so difficult to recog-
              | nise its racial undercurrents. Our analysis of the SMF campaign shows
              | that while civil society movements address people’s concerns in rhetoric,
              | they may in fact contribute to discursive practices that are rooted in
              | prejudice and aimed at divisive politics along ethnic lines. The Save Ma-
              | bira agitation has potential as a building block for participatory democ-
              | racy only if it owns up to the acts of injustice and the crimes perpetrated
              | in its name.
              | Outlook
              | The Mabira Forest issue could move in one of several directions. One
              | strand of analysis emphasises that, through the results of the 2011 par-
              | liamentary elections, a challenge has arisen to Museveni in the form of a
              | “record number” of parliamentarians belonging to the same party as the
              | president but being considerably younger than him (Vokes 2012: 311-
              | 312). The argument goes that this young generation of politicians thrives
              | on local support and has challenged the president on a number of
              | counts, from ministerial appointments and the draft anti-bail bill (pre-
              | sumably targeting members of the opposition and dissidents) to the
              | decision to sacrifice part of Mabira Forest for a sugarcane plantation.
              | The International Crisis Group (2012: 33) considers opposition to the
              | Mabira project – even from MPs belonging to the National Resistance
              | Movement, Museveni’s own political party – as one of several promising
              | signs for the preparedness of parliamentary democracy to assert its con-
              | stitutional powers.
              | Off the record, however, many analysts admit that they are sceptical
              | about the longevity of the SMF campaign, given its heterogeneity and
              | lack of vision. They predict that the resistance from a cross-section of
              | political dissidents and civil society groups will eventually wane, allowing
              | Museveni and his inner circle to prevail with their plans for Mabira For-
              | est. It has not been lost on observers that Ugandan government rhetoric
              | no longer distinguishes between lawful and unlawful dissent on constitu-

              | pronounce views on large-scale investment projects such as the one
              | planned for Mabira. In a report on the conditions of NGO work in
              | Uganda, Human Rights Watch (2012: 27) observes that organisations
              | carrying out research, advocacy, and citizen education on environmental
              | issues have faced “increasing obstructions” from the government in the
              | form of threats of deregistration, accusations of sabotaging government
              | programmes, and arrest.
              | There are also indications that government agencies are being stream-
              | lined on controversial issues. Neither the National Environment Man-
              | agement Agency nor the National Forestry Authority makes any refer-
              | ence to the Mabira issue on their respective websites, which is curious
              | given that both initially positioned themselves against the leasing out of
              | forest land to SCOUL. It is clear, therefore, that the Ugandan govern-
              | ment has adopted a flexible approach to handling the Mabira Forest
              | case, yielding to pressure when it became too strong and pushing for the
              | leasing out of land when it felt that it was in a politically advantageous
              | position to do so and the campaign had started to come undone. How-
              | ever, even if Museveni gives up on his plans for Mabira Forest, the divi-
              | sive tone used by all stakeholders has introduced a toxic element into the
              | discourse on development that will take time to diminish.
              | Conclusions
              | This paper has attempted to show that since the SMF campaign was
              | launched in 2007 in response to plans of the Ugandan government to
              | hand over one-fourth of the forest to a sugar company for cultivation of
              | sugarcane, it has drawn strength from a network of loosely connected
              | civil society groups. Contrary to popular perception, the SMF campaign
              | does not constitute a continuous and sustained movement. Instead, it
              | must be understood as a string of activist spells, each provoked by a per-
              | ceived need to respond to government initiatives to push the agenda on
              | Mabira.
              | The paper cites evidence indicating that the government’s case in
              | support of the Mabira Forest project is weak in terms of substance. The
              | lack of available data on the impact of agro-industrial investment in Ma-

              | dissenting voices, not on policy grounds, but by way of declaring a per-
              | sonal “war on sugar”.
              | The paper also challenges the uncritical appraisal of civil society
              | groups in sub-Saharan Africa as democratic checks to neopatrimonial
              | regimes. Although it is popular strategy among activists to paint political
              | controversies with a broad brush, the portrayal of land use issues as a
              | fight between good and evil creates binaries that are easily exploitable for
              | purposes of identity politics. Irrespective of whether the Mabira Forest
              | dispute sees business interests or community concerns prevail, the way in
              | which racial stereotypes were played up in the campaign reveals a disqui-
              | eting trend towards fragmentation of Ugandan society. In the final analy-
              | sis, the SMF campaign and its ugly underbelly lend credence to claims
              | for a widening and deepening of civil society engagement, but also to
              | calls for a critical reflection of what drives activism, within local commu-
              | nities and across national borders. For civic activism to become an asset
              | for democratic governance of the commons, however problematic the
              | term, it will need to focus not only on a campaign agenda but also on a
              | vision for an inclusive society.

              | Der Konflikt um das Mabira-Naturschutzgebiet
              | Zusammenfassung: In den vergangenen Jahren hat die ugandische
              | Regierung wiederholt Schritte zur Abholzung von einem Viertel des
              | Mabira-Naturschutzgebiets in Zentral-Uganda eingeleitet, um den Boden
              | einem Agrarunternehmen, das von einem international operierenden
              | Großkonzern kontrolliert wird, für den Zuckerrohranbau anzubieten.
              | Immer wenn die Umsetzung des Projekts drohte, organisierten zivilge-
              | sellschaftliche Gruppen breite Protestaktionen, sodass die Regierung ihre
              | Pläne zurückstellen musste. Die Kampagne zur Rettung des Mabira-
              | Waldes wird häufig als Beispiel dafür angeführt, dass ausdauernder Pro-

              | entierte Akteure, die mit unbedarften oder korrupten Politikern und
              | Bürokraten Geschäfte ausbrüten, abschrecken kann. Eine tiefer gehende

text          | Analyse der Kampagne offenbart jedoch, dass hier ökologische und
              | soziale Anliegen mit Partikularinteressen verflochten sind. Der Autor
              | untersucht das komplexe Interaktionsgeflecht zwischen Staat, Groß-
