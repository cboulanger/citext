              | Abstract
              | Since the Treaty of Maastricht transparency and openness have been prominent catchwords
              | to counter the European Union’s (EU) so called ‘democratic deficit’. The working paper
              | discusses the rank and position of these principles in democratic theory and looks at their
              | realisation at the EU level. Since the EU-bodies equal transparency and openness mainly
              | with access to information the paper concentrates on the question, which institution is willing
              | to provide best for access to documents. In the course of shaping a new regulation on
              | access to documents in May 2001, the contrasting views of Commission, European
              | Parliament and Council showed up in their respective draft proposals. The different
              | proposals are analysed and assessed with regard to transparency and openness.
              | Zusammenfassung
              | Seit dem Vertrag von Maastricht dienen die Begriffe “Transparenz” und “Offenheit” als
              | beliebte Schlagwörter, um dem sogenannten Demokratiedefizit der Europäischen Union
              | (EU) zu begegnen. Das Working Paper widmet sich dem Stellenwert dieser Prinzipien in der
              | Demokratietheorie und zeichnet ihre Implementierung auf EU-Ebene nach. Da die EU-
              | Institutionen Transparenz und Offenheit hauptsächlich mit Zugang zu Informationen
              | gleichsetzen, konzentriert sich die Analyse auf die Frage, welche Institution für den
              | bestmöglichsten Zugang eintritt. Im Mai 2001 wurde eine neue Verordnung über den Zugang
              | der Öffentlichkeit zu Dokumenten verabschiedet. Die Vorschläge, die im Vorfeld von
              | Kommission, Europäischem Parlament und Rat erstellt wurden, dienen in der vorliegenden
              | Arbeit als Grundlage zur Analyse der unterschiedlichen Interpretationen von Transparenz
              | und Offenheit.

              | 1. Introduction
              | Since the early 1990s scholarly debate and political rhetoric has increasingly concentrated
              | on the issue of democratization of the European Union. This shift in perspective is mainly
              | due to the “organic and evolutionary way” (Westlake 1998: 127) of the Union’s development.
              | Along with the increase in communitarized policy fields and a growing number of decisions
              | taking place at the European level, the question of legitimacy in the European Union
              | substantially gained in importance. Although the single Member States continue to enjoy
              | democratic legitimacy of policy-making in the national arena by well-established
              | mechanisms, the fusion of national and supranational policies is attended with deficiencies in
              | legitimacy. This became obvious with rising popular discontent accompanying the shaping of
              | the Maastricht Treaty.
              | One of the solutions offered by the European Union to counter the so-called ‘democratic
              | deficit’ has been the call for more transparency and openness in the working of the European
              | Union’s institutions and the decision-making at the European level. In the EU’s actual steps
              | to increase transparency and openness, the notion of these principles has been mainly
              | realized in access to information. ‘An ever closer Union’ where decisions are taken ‘as open
              | as possible’ seemed achievable by changing the ways of how to grant citizens access to
              | documents. But how open is ‘open as possible’?
              | Since the EU equals openness and transparency mainly with access to information the
              | relevant provisions may reveal how these principles are implemented. The issue in question
              | has been put once more on the EU-agenda recently. Following the obligations of the
              | Amsterdam Treaty, the Council in codecision with the European Parliament agreed on a new
              | regulation on access to documents in May 2001. Until then, the Commission, the Council,
              | and the European Parliament followed fairly the same codes of conduct. However, research
              | indicates that the EU bodies interpreted access to documents in different ways (Gronbech-
              | Jensen 1998). The proposals issued by the Commission, the European Parliament, and the
              | Council allow a comparison of the present views on how to define and restrict openness and
              | transparency. The analysis will concentrate on the question, which EU-institution is willing to
              | provide best for access to information thus providing for democratic legitimacy through
              | transparency and openness.
              | In the course of this paper transparency and openness will be pinned down to the specific
              | instrument of access to documents that is designed to fulfill a specific purpose in a specific
              | institutional arrangement. It will be looked at how major players in the framework of the
              | European Union aim to fulfill the basic ideas of these catchwords. The first part of the paper
              | concentrates on the rank and position of transparency and openness in democratic theory
              | and looks at how these principles have evolved and been realized by the main European
              | bodies. The second part is devoted to the comparison of the different views of Commission,
              | 2 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S
              | European Parliament and Council on access to documents. The findings will be finally
              | reassessed with regard to the implications on the democratic quality of policy-making in the
              | European Union.
              | 2. The debate on transparency and openness
              | The discussion on transparency and openness in the European Union covers a large variety
              | of perspectives. In terms of a lack of democratic legitimacy, the two ideas are closely related
              | to an ‘information deficit’ (Lodge 1994). Transparency through information is perceived as a
              | major instrument to improve democracy in the EU thus not only taming the secretive nature
              | of the Council’s policy-making (Curtin 1995). The Council’s policy has been proven to be
              | disappointing when focusing on special requests for documents (Carvel 1998). Closely
              | related to the Council’s information policy in general is its strong position in the
              | intergovernmental pillars which consequently renders fields as Justice and Home Affairs
              | hardly accessible (de Boer 1998). The Community’s policy is generally discussed highly
              | critical hence advocating more transparency, openness, and visibility (Guggenbühl 1998).
              | Comparative research has shown that the Community’s standards do not come up to the
              | tradition of the Nordic countries in open government, suggesting the latter as a solution for
              | the Union’s problems in legitimacy (Gronbech-Jensen 1998). However, contributions from
              | information professionals indicate that access to information has changed for the better
              | (Thomson 1998). This is confirmed by historic review pointing out that transparency has
              | enormously improved, which is partly due to the impact of an expanded role of the European
              | Parliament (Westlake 1998). Transparency is nowadays seen at the very heart of ‘good
              | administration’ (Söderman 2000). The European Ombudsman Jacob Söderman likewise
              | focuses on the democratic nature of the principle. The free flow of information and ideas
              | between departments could very well further transparent and efficient administration which is
              | e.g. in the Commission highly troubled by the fact that different Directorate Generals are in a
              | “state of near civil war” (Lord 1998: 83). However, these approaches neglect the internal
              | working of an institution and its internal transparency.
              | 2.1. Defining transparency and openness
              | The common denominator of these different approaches is their linking of transparency and
              | openness to legitimacy. They are focusing on the transparency of political institutions in their
              | relation to civil society, be they private individual or business interest, the media or elected
              | representatives. However, definitions of transparency vary among the various approaches
              | and stress particular features of the underlying idea. Transparency is viewed and defined
              | differently: ranging from a narrow perspective of simple and clear procedures up to as broad
              | as “effective popular access to the decision making process” (de Boer 1998: 99).
              | Transparency at its simplest is “the ability to look clearly through the windows of an
              | I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 3
              | institution” (de Boer 1998: 105). The very idea is made clear by this metaphor: to open up
              | the working procedures not immediately visible to those not directly involved in order to
              | demonstrate the good working of an institution.
              | Adapted to political systems, transparency is a feature in the relationship between ruler and
              | ruled, namely by granting “that the operation of the government is sufficiently open to public
              | view and simple enough in its essentials that citizens can readily understand how and what it
              | is doing” (Dahl 1998: 126). Given these attributes, transparency is usually used along the
              | same lines as openness and frequently linked to simplicity and comprehensibility. Openness
              | and transparency can also be viewed as slightly different concepts (see Larsson 1998: 40),
              | but they are usually equaled since they both refer to a certain quality. So “openness and
              | transparency is clearly one and the same thing (…), the activity of lifting the veil of secrecy.”
              | (Davis 1998: 121). Transparency and/or openness are seen as a prerequisite for modern
              | policy-making by adding the distinctive flavor of democratic legitimacy.
              | 2.2. Transparency and openness as tools for democratic legitimacy
              | When talking about democracy, one should bear in mind the distinction between ideal
              | democracy and actual democracy as Robert Dahl (1998: 26) has rightly observed. The first
              | provides us with requirements and goals of democracy. The second offers empirical
              | evidence given the restrictions of the real world. The latter can then be measured against
              | normative demands. Differentiating between these two perspectives may be crucial to
              | assess if the assumed democratic tools are suitable to achieve democratic aims and to place
              | them in the entirety of democratic practices. A given number of people eager to decide on a
              | certain type of polity may have a mixture of diffuse ideas and hopes as well as practical
              | considerations of the future polity in mind. Modern large scale democracies have to develop
              | institutional arrangements to satisfy democratic criteria, namely effective participation,
              | control of the agenda, voting equality, full inclusion, and enlightened understanding (Dahl
              | 1998: 85).
              | In the course of legitimizing the emerging EU polity, transparency has been a prominent
              | catchword designated to stand as one of the principles capable of rendering the European
              | Union more democratic. Interesting enough, the debate over transparency has mainly been
              | inspired by practical steps whereas “democratic theory has very little to say in this field”
              | (Larson 1998: 40). Transparency and openness are in general linked to individual rights as
              | e.g. freedom of speech, freedom of press, or the right to vote, but the principles are not at
              | the very heart of democratic theory. However, “classical and contemporary theories of
              | democracy are posited on the belief that secrecy menaces democracy, follows philosophy of
              | a totalitarian state” (Curtin 1998: 107). Opening up the legislative and executive procedures
              | is an essential for democratic policy making. Subsequently, what people learn by using these
              | open and comprehensible channels may help them in participating in policy making. It is in
              | 4 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S
              | this sense one means to achieve legitimacy according to a modern understanding of
              | democracy in a bundle of mechanisms. Transparency and openness are instruments to
              | satisfy democratic criteria, especially the ability for citizens to participate in governance and
              | to hold leaders accountable.
              | Different ideal models of democracy highlight different democratic qualities inherent in
              | transparency and openness. Traditional representative democracy mainly stresses that
              | transparency allows and simplifies accountability and control of rulership. This is well
              | illustrated by describing transparency as follows: “[t]hus it must not be so complexly
              | constructed that citizens can readily understand how and, because they do not understand
              | their government, cannot readily hold their leaders accountable, particularly at elections”
              | (Dahl 1998: 126). The basic idea is that power corrupts. Those equipped with the means for
              | leadership should therefore be observed and scrutinized. Control is necessary in democratic
              | systems and “essentially about preventing abuses by those we have chosen to govern us”
              | (Verhoeven 2000: 2).
              | Participatory and deliberative approaches offer a slightly different perspective by assuming
              | that transparency and openness promote a vivid civil society. “The reason why information
              | should be open and accessible in any democracy worthy of its name is to enable political
              | participation by citizens” (Curtin 1998: 110). This approach obliges the political elites to grant
              | openness in order “to create channels for the people enabling them to participate in the work
              | of the government” (Larsson 1998: 41). A democratic government has to be based on public
              | deliberation and has to dissociate from the idea of policy-making in closed circles. Access
              | and subsequently participation are in this line of thinking crucial, taking it for granted that
              | “openness in government cannot be limited to forms of parliamentary control but must
              | include a wide range of mechanisms enabling participation of citizens in the policy process
              | by means of an effective access to the process and voice within it” (Verhoeven 2000:5).
              | Both approaches basically rely on access to information as a tool to achieve transparency
              | and openness. Access to information plays a central role:
              | Information and the availability or accessibility of information is and remains the currency of
              | democracy. Without an adequate flow of information even ex post facto accountability of the
              | governors to the people is meaningless. It is regarded as essential to the democratic process
              | that individuals are able to understand the decision-making process and the means by which
              | the decision-makers have reached their conclusions in order to effectively evaluate
              | government policies and actions and to be able to choose their representatives intelligently.
              | An equally important objective of openness in democratic government is to enhance public
              | confidence in the government (Curtin 1998: 107).
              | Apart from these two approaches that heavily rely on democratic justifications, a third can be
              | identified. It is rather concerned with the restrictions to transparency due to conflicting
              | I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 5
              | values, namely efficiency. “Although it is certainly important that the public have access to
              | relevant information about administration, working in a goldfish bowl can rarely be as
              | efficient as working in private” (Peters 1995: 297). The basic assumption stresses that policy-
              | making is mainly about positive outcomes for a given population. Too much openness may
              | hamper negotiations and may “lead to attitudes of legalism and risk aversion” (Verhoeven
              | 2000: 2). This view focuses on the bargaining character of policy-making. The very character
              | of political trade-offs makes it necessary to withhold information for some time. In order to
              | achieve the best possible outcome, information can be used when appropriate in the
              | deliberative processes. So openness as legitimizing positive quality is weakening efficiency
              | as a legitimizing quality.
              | Even if efficiency is not given priority over transparency, openness is never an absolute
              | category in the actual shaping of political systems. Actual democratic practice has to take
              | into account that there may be other conflicting values, e.g. the right to privacy of individuals.
              | Moreover, different political systems have created different degrees of openness over time.
              | The variety of diverse regulations in the 15 EU Member States illustrates that a broad
              | spectrum of actual regulations within both democratic and efficient political systems is
              | possible. Transparency and openness are neither a dependent nor an independent variable,
              | “[a] certain type of government and a certain type of institutional arrangement will produce a
              | certain type of openness on the one hand, but on the other hand a certain type of openness
              | will affect the institutional setting” (Larsson 1998: 44).
              | 3. Transparency and openness in the European Union
              | Neither democracy nor transparency was on the agenda of the early European Community
              | for Coal and Steal. As Carvel puts it, the “EEC were a benevolent conspiracy by the elites of
              | Europe to bind their peoples and stop another war” (Carvel 1998: 56). Cooperation between
              | European nation states resembled an international regime with diplomatic negotiations
              | prevailing. However, things changed with the growing communitarization of European
              | policies. The shift in power relations and the evolvement of a new style of policy-making with
              | intermingling national and supranational levels cast shadow on usual ways how to handle
              | EU politics. Democratic and transparent decision-making would have been an alienated idea
              | in diplomatic interaction but was seen as an adequate answer to the increase in popular
              | discontent over the development of the European Union.
              | The growing discrepancies due to the changes in policy making showed up in many areas
              | and were also highlighted with regard to access to information. In September 1992 the Dutch
              | Member of Parliament, Alman Metten, asked a Dutch ministry to hand over documents
              | concerning various ECOFIN-meetings which he considered important for his parliamentary
              | work. He referred to the Dutch law granting openness and argued that “Council deliberations
              | 6 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S
              | and decisions (...) should be subject to the law on openness, otherwise a growing area of
              | formerly transparent policy and decision-making will be brought out of reach of the law of
              | openness as well as that of democratic control.” (Metten 1998: 86f) After lengthy
              | deliberations the Netherlands finally refused in 1995 to release the documents stating that
              | the Community’s concerns and needs were in this case prior to national law.
              | Issues of legitimacy had long been up to the single Member State, but it seemed to become
              | increasingly important to include related commitments and provisions in the acquis
              | communitaire. Transparency and Openness came first on the agenda in the early 1990s. On
              | 15 December 1991 declaration No. 17 attached to the Maastricht Treaty confirmed, “the
              | Conference considers that transparency of the decision-making process strengthens the
              | democratic nature of the institutions and the public’s confidence in the administration” (cit. a.
              | Lodge 1994: 349). Transparency was used as a handy answer to rising popular concern of
              | what was going on at the European level. Given the qualities of transparency, one can only
              | admire the audacity to put transparency on the EU agenda ever. Decision-making had by
              | then already gained increased impact and complexity. To render the EU decision-making
              | process open, simple and therefore understandable seems a rather risky goal.
              | Nevertheless, this presumed remedy of the so called ‘democratic deficit’ was particularly
              | promoted by the Member States which did not want to trouble themselves to discuss the
              | practices of the Council and the implications of a substantial shift in decision making away
              | from the national level. The addressee was first of all the Commission, which was frequently
              | referred to as “byzantine, inaccessible and an affront to the conduct of democratic politics”
              | (see Lodge 1994: 345). Attacking the Commission and calling for more openness had
              | unintended consequences. Involuntarily, the discussion and subsequent measures to
              | enhance transparency and openness brought into light again the rather obscure procedures
              | of the Council’s internal working and decision-making.
              | When France almost rejected the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in its 1992 referendum
              | and the Danes also refused to give consent in the first referendum, increasing concern
              | focused on the people’s interest in the project “European Union.” Along with frequent
              | reference to democracy and subsidiarity as adequate tools to meet the people’s demands,
              | the notion of transparency was introduced. A firmly declaration stressed the aim to create „an
              | ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as openly as
              | possible and as closely as possible to the citizen” (Article 1 (A) TEU). Transparency was
              | subsequently transposed into the specific instrument of access to documents with Article 255
              | (191a) saying that
              | 1. Any citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered
              | office in a Member State, shall have a right of access to European Parliament, Council and
              | Commission documents, subject to the principles and the conditions to be defined in
              | accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.
              | I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 7
              | 2. General principles and limits on grounds of public or private interest governing this right of
              | access to documents shall be determined by the Council, acting in accordance with the
              | procedure referred to in Article 251 within two years of the entry into force of the Treaty of
              | Amsterdam.
              | 3. Each institution referred to above shall elaborate in its own Rules of Procedure specific
              | provisions regarding access to its documents.
              | The distinctive status of the Council was acknowledged in Article 207 leaving it up to its will
              | to decide whether documents touched its role as legislator or not. Article 207 (151) specified
              | for the Council that
              | 4. The Council shall adopt its Rules of Procedure. For the purpose of applying Article 255(3),
              | the Council shall elaborate in these Rules the conditions under which the public shall have
              | access to Council documents. For the purpose of this paragraph, the Council shall define the
              | cases in which it is to be regarded as acting in its legislative capacity, with a view to allowing
              | greater access to documents in those cases, while at the same time preserving the
              | effectiveness of its decision making process. In any event, when the Council acts in its
              | legislative capacity, the results of votes and explanations of vote as well as statements in the
              | minutes shall be made public.
              | The introduction of the right to information in the context of internal rules of procedure has
              | provoked critical remarks (see e.g. Curtin 1998:112). The Dutch government, which regarded
              | the right to information as a fundamental right, lodged a plea with the European Court of
              | Justice (Case 58/94), but was eventually repudiated. It was therefore up to the body’s
              | internal code of conduct how to shape transparency.
              | Following the Treaty’s obligations, the different EU bodies made up their own regulations on
              | access to documents. The Council adopted a code of conduct concerning public access to
              | Council and Commission documents in December 1993, which was adopted by the
              | Commission in February 1994. The European Parliament implemented a similar system in
              | 1997. Moreover, the Treaty of Amsterdam fixed that a regulation on access to documents of
              | all three bodies should be adopted under the codecision procedure within two years of entry
              | into force of the Amsterdam Treaty.
              | None of the bodies has committed itself to absolute transparency. The Commission’s and the
              | Council’s code of conduct listed several exceptions including public interest, individual
              | privacy, commercial and industrial secrecy as well as the Community’s financial interests.
              | Access to documents was likewise denied if requested by the supplier, were it a Member
              | State or another third party. Documents also remained confidential if the EU-body claimed an
              | interest in the confidentiality of the proceedings. The European Parliament decided to refuse
              | access to documents of certain parliamentary meetings in order to protect the confidentiality
              | 8 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S
              | of deliberations of political groups. The rather narrow definition of the Commission and the
              | Council has been challenged on various occasions. The subsequent judgments of the
              | European Courts and the investigations of the European Ombudsman can be regarded as
              | an invitation to reconsider the practice of the institutions.
              | Most of the refusals to grant access referred to the confidentiality of the proceedings. In
              | Guardian versus Council (Case T–194/94) the English newspaper demanded documents
              | concerning Justice and Agricultural Councils without success. The decision of the Court of
              | First Instance turned the Council’s position down and ordered the release of these
              | documents. Moreover, it stressed the necessity of an accurate balancing test guaranteeing
              | that the interest of citizens to get hold of documents should be carefully examined against
              | the needs of internal proceedings. The same idea was expressed in WWF UK versus
              | Commission (Case T–105/95). The Court conceded that certain documents out of a bundle
              | might be withhold but that those which failed the balancing test should be handed over to the
              | applicant. The discrepancies between Member State’s practice and the Council’s position
              | were again highlighted when Swedish journalists demanded documents relating to Europol.
              | Sweden handed over 18 out of 20 documents, the Council only 4. The Swedish journalists
              | lodged a plea before the Council of First Instance (Svenska Journalistförbundet versus
              | Council, T–174/95) and the Court finally annulled the Council’s decision for not sufficiently
              | reasoning the refusal. Generally, the judgments of the European Court suggest a careful
              | examination of requests on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the Court has frequently taken
              | the side of applicants who were denied access to documents by the EU institutions. Its
              | judgments therefore have “broadened the scope of access rights” (Verhoeven 2000: 9).
              | Another way to reassess the interpretations of the rules of conduct is by complaining to the
              | European Ombudsman. He has been installed to serve as an intermediary between single
              | citizens and the European Union. Transparency and access to information is one of the
              | major tasks of the Ombudsman. His own-initiated inquiry aimed to close the loophole in
              | Article 255, which covers only the Commission, the Council, and the European Parliament.
              | The Ombudsman’s inquiry included 15 EU institutions and bodies and suggested
              | improvements regarding access to documents. Although his inquiries lack the virtue of law
              | the conclusions of the Ombudsman have some impact given the very nature of the office.
              | Complaints to the Ombudsman on transparency concern most of all the infringement
              | procedure, recruitment procedures and access to documents (see Söderman 2000). The
              | Ombudsman was also used to defy the Council’s restrictive dealing with documents
              | concerning the Third Pillar. Frequent requests on documents made by a British Journalist on
              | behalf of the human rights organization “StateWatch” had frequently been refused.
              | Since the emergence of the transparency theme access to information on EU politics has
              | substantially improved. Thanks to the use of electronic media, the lack of information on the
              | EU bodies and their working has been enormously reduced. Many bodies and institutions
              | nowadays offer registers of documents. Press releases, minutes and previews of the agenda
              | I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 9
              | are readily available. However, comprehensive information on the working of the EU at large
              | or thematic information sheets rather highlight the service-orientated character of an
              | institution than stressing the frequently proclaimed democratic upgrading by adding
              | transparency. Likewise, the very idea of broadcasting Council meetings may promote the
              | understanding of EU policy-making, the actual programs are rather uninformative and
              | moreover, “flavored with propaganda” (Guggenbühl 1998: 24). “Enlightened understanding”
              | as a democratic criteria channeled through the intermediaries of an active civil society will
              | not be achieved by this means.
              | 4. Transparency and openness in comparison
              | The debate on the new regulation regarding public access to European Parliament, Council
              | and Commission documents gave the opportunity to analyze the current positions of the
              | three EU-bodies with regard to transparency and openness. The comparison works on the
              | assumption that access to information strengthens democratic legitimacy. If everybody has
              | access to each single document drawn up in the public administration as well as to those
              | documents worked out during legislative policy-making, transparency and openness are
              | maximized. Criteria for assessing the differences and similarities between the positions of
              | the EU-bodies are the question of who has access to what documents under which
              | conditions. However, the very nature of the EU polity causes scenarios, which go beyond the
              | scope of the analysis. Since legislation on access to information vary among the Member
              | States, an upgrading of access on the EU-level might override provisions on the national
              | level. Extensive access to documents on grounds of the new regulation could then lead to an
              | upgrading of transparency in some Member States while at the same time weakening the
              | right to information in others, namely the Nordic countries. The question of how to deal with
              | the so-called “Third party”-documents, which includes those of Member States, will be
              | therefore touched, too.
              | Transparency and openness by means of access to information are frequently linked to
              | accountability and participation but actual democratic practice illustrates that access to
              | documents is always limited in one way or the other. Yet, not only the institutional
              | arrangement but also the nature of the institutions itself is shaping the degree of openness
              | and transparency. Along the lines of how much transparency may possibly be granted, the
              | institutional view will define how access is granted under which conditions, what kind of
              | information is accessible and why access is granted or denied. The institution’s culture, its
              | self-perception, and its inherent institutional targets will influence the degree of openness,
              | which is consequently defended against conflicting and concurrent positions.
              | 10 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S
              | 4.1. Foci of the three proposals on the regulation of access to
              | documents
              | In accordance with the EC-Treaty obligations Article 251(2) and 255(2) the Commission
              | issued a proposal for public access to documents of the Council, the Commission and the
              | European Parliament. The Commission proposal (COM (2000) 30 final/2) of 21 February
              | 2000 was forwarded to both Parliament and Council.
              | The European Parliament primarily dealt with the new regulation in several meetings of the
              | Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which considered
              | opinions of other committees, too. The Committee adopted its draft legislative resolution on
              | 24 October 2000 by 28 votes to 4, with 2 abstentions and made it available to the public
              | (Doc. No. A5–0318/2000). This draft would have been subject to the vote in plenary session,
              | which was eventually postponed in order to open up informal meetings with both
              | Commission and Council.
              | Somewhat different and highly indicative is the proceeding in the Council, which dealt with
              | the regulation in various sessions of the COREPER working group on information under
              | subsequent the Portuguese, the French and the Swedish presidency. Common positions are
              | much more difficult to find since the positions of each of the 15 Member States has to be
              | considered. Access to documents is subject to a wide range of implementation forms in
              | respective national legislation. Differences with regard to Member States legislation cover
              | the whole range between narrow definitions of openness and a very extensive practice in
              | granting access to documents. A review of national legislations shows that e.g. Great Britain
              | makes extensive use of the so-called secrecy act thus withdrawing official documents from
              | public scrutiny. On the opposite, the Nordic countries have long times practiced the open
              | government approach. The adoption of a common position at the General Affairs Committee
              | meeting was tabled for the end of November, then postponed to January 2001. The Swedish
              | Presidency’s working paper of that meeting which is the basis for comparison still reflects
              | internally unsettled issues.
              | The obvious difficulties to find a compromise provoked a substantial delay in the adoption of
              | the new legislation. A series of informal “trilogue meetings” started at the end of January
              | 2001 and was concluded with a compromise. The regulation was finally adopted on 30 May
              | 2001 (Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001).
              | The Commission’s proposal stresses in its recitals the necessity to broaden transparency
              | and openness, thus enabling “citizens to participate more closely in the decision-making
              | process, and guarantees that the administration enjoys greater legitimacy and is more
              | effective and more accountable vis-à-vis the citizen in a democratic system” (Comm, recital
              | 2). It reaffirms this commitment by reminding of the European Councils of Birmingham,
              | Edinburgh and Copenhagen, which extensively dealt with transparency. The prime
              | I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 11
              | addressee of the regulation is therefore “the citizen.” Despite this commitment, the making of
              | the Commission’s proposal has provoked criticism for not involving representatives of civil
              | society. The European Committee of the British House of Lords judged that “[a]n important
              | political opportunity was missed. Extensive external consultation would have demonstrated
              | commitment to openness. It might have gone some way to restore to the institution some of
              | the legitimacy and credibility it lost with the collapse of the Santer Commission.”1 However,
              | the draft confirms the will to shape the European Union as a democratic system. The
              | principle of openness shall guarantee civic participation and accountability.
              | Apart from the rights of Member States, the scope of the Parliament’s regulation is much
              | broader than that of the Commission. Specific rules on access only stay in force if they
              | provide more access. The parliament intends an extensive approach including remarks on
              | future provisions on access to documents: “On the same basis, the present regulation is the
              | legal framework for existing and future interinstitutional agreements in relation to methods of
              | drafting laws, content and format of the Official Journal, managing and storing documents
              | with a view to granting access, and guidelines on the rules on modalities for access to
              | documents” (EP, recital 3).
              | With regard to the principal motivation of the regulation on access to documents this draft
              | shows other focal points. The proposal makes reference to the acquis communitaire and
              | declaration 17 as well as the Charta of Fundamental Rights. It stresses in its justification to
              | recital 0 that “[a] truly democratic debate cannot develop in the European Union without open
              | institutions” and promotes the right of information. Transparency through access to
              | documents suffices another principle by granting protection “against the arbitrary use of and
              | the abuse of power and against corruption and fraud” (EP, recital 2). The draft is clearly
              | aimed at the citizen and the general public.
              | The Council’s working paper issued under Swedish presidency2 reflects a rapprochement
              | between the Member States and makes some concessions to the European Parliament’s
              | draft. The position of the Council diverges however from those of Commission and the
              | European Parliament. The draft confirms in its recitals the principle of openness and
              | transparency as a means to achieve greater legitimacy, effectiveness and accountability. It
              | follows the Commission’s wording in saying that “[o]penness enables citizens to participate
              | more closely in the decision-making process and guarantees that the administration enjoys
              | greater legitimacy and is more effective and more accountable to the citizen in a democratic
              | system” (Council, recital 2). The aim is “to widen access to documents as far as possible”
              | 1 House of Lords, European Communities Committee, Sixteenth Report: Public Access to EU Documents, HL
              | 2 1N0o2n;e1oAfutghuestw2o0r0k0ing papers and drafts of the Council was accessible through the Council's register of
              | documents. However, several documents were played into the hands of the British human rights organization
              | StateWatch which made them available to the public via Internet (www.statewatch.org)
              | 12 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S
              | (Council, recital 4). However, the Council makes special reference to Article 255(3) in
              | proclaiming that Council’s documents concerning legislative issues should be more
              | accessible “while at the same time preserving the effectiveness of their decision-making
              | process” (Council, recital 6).
              | 4.2. Transparency in perspective
              | Getting information is a way of empowerment in terms of democratic citizenship. Access to
              | documents therefore centers on the question how much access is granted. This includes
              | definitions of those who benefit as well as procedures on access. Another important criterion
              | is the scope of access. The accessibility of documents refers both to the stage in the policy-
              | making cycle as well as to policy fields. A rather special case due to the nature of the
              | European Union has to be considered, too. The multi-level system offers multiple points of
              | access, notably the EU-institutions and the Member States. The question of how to deal
              | judicially with this configuration cannot be assessed in terms of more or less access since
              | national provisions vary. Whether Member States have the final say in the disclosure of
              | documents originating from a nation state or not rather touches the question of weakening
              | the Member States or strengthening the European Union’s impact.
              | 4.2.1. Beneficiaries of the regulation
              | The provision on who should be entitled to access shows little divergences. Beneficiaries
              | shall be all Union citizens, all enterprises having their office within the territory of the EU, and
              | all legal residents. The Parliament’s as well as the Council’s drafts exceed this right to non-
              | EU natural or legal persons although the wording indicates that this right is not enforceable.
              | This is a slight but however important improvement towards more openness since namely
              | accession states may have a strong interest to get hold of certain EU-documents. All three
              | proposals in principle agree that no reason has to be given by the applicant as far as his
              | specific interest is concerned. However, only the European Parliament’s position is without
              | reservation: “The institution concerned may ask the applicant for further details regarding the
              | application” (Comm, par. 5.1). A similar wording is used in the Councils respective paragraph
              | (Council, par. 3A(2)). The wording of both the Commission’s and the Council’s proposal open
              | a backdoor to revise this principle, whereas the Parliament’s draft defines rather narrowly
              | that asking back is only possible “for the purposes of identifying the documents” (EP, par.
              | 5.1). The European Parliament’s draft does not mention large documents or repeated
              | requests whereas both Commission and Council consider these cases and make specific
              | provisions. A specific rule applies in case of large documents or repeated requests. The
              | Council follows the suggestions of the Commission saying that “[i]n the event of general and
              | repetitive applications or applications relating to very large documents or a very large
              | number of documents, the institution concerned may confer with the applicant informally,
              | with a view to finding a fair solution” (Council, par. 3a(3)).
              | I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 13
              | Speeding up the process of application is seen as a citizen-orientated approach by the
              | Parliament. Whereas the Commission sets a time limit of one month to reply to an initial
              | application, the Parliament’s approach reduces the answering time to two weeks and
              | demands to hand over at the same time the requested documents in case of a positive
              | decision (EP, par. 5.2). The Council’s draft expresses its commitment that applications “shall
              | be handled promptly” (Council, par 5.1), but leans on the Commission’s position of a
              | deadline for response limited to one month.
              | As far as requests for documents are concerned, each draft foresees in its paragraph 5 a
              | fairly similar procedure. If the application is not accepted, the applicant is entitled to make a
              | confirmatory request. If this request is turned down, the institution has to inform about
              | possible remedies, namely a complaint to the Ombudsman or the lodging of the complaint
              | with the European Court of Justice. The Council’s proposal foresees however that
              | “[c]onfirmatory applications for sensitive documents shall be handled only by those persons
              | who have a right to acquaint themselves with those documents according to the internal
              | rules of the institution concerned” (Council, par. 6(1)). The European Parliament takes a
              | somehow different view by demanding, “[p]arliamentary scrutiny of all documents excluded
              | from public access shall be assured by regularly informing a body of the European
              | Parliament” (EP, par. 7).

              | 4.2.2. Proactive measures
              | In its efforts to shape the regulation on access as an overall guideline on the future access to
              | information, the European Parliament’s proposal embraces the detailed handling of registers,
              | unlike the Commission’s initial draft. Although many bodies and institutions of the European
              | Union already offer registers accessible by the Internet, the European Parliament sets great
              | store of regulating this point specifically and incorporates a proactive approach to information
              | on documents. It suggests therefore the installation of a register for each institution. These
              | have to include at a minimum “all documents created by that institution in the course of a
              | procedure for the adoption of legally binding measures, notably all proposals, opinions,
              | working documents, agendas, documents for discussion at formal meetings, minutes,
              | declarations and positions of Member States” (EP, par. 9a(3)). The register has to list those
              | documents that are excluded from access indicating reasons for exclusion (EP, par. 9a(2)).
              | Apart from that, these documents have to be incorporated in the public register from the
              | moment of time a decision has been made or at the moment a document is sent to others
              | like third parties, institutions or internal bodies (EP, par 9a(1)). Whenever possible
              | I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 15
              | documents shall be available directly thus creating registers as an interface between the
              | institutions and citizens.
              | The Council follows this approach by stating that this would “make the citizens’ rights arising
              | from this Regulation effective” (Council par. 9a(1)). Differing from the EPs position the
              | Council simply demands a short description of the content. A huge difference shows up in
              | the treatment of documents subject to exceptions: “Reference shall not be made if disclosure
              | of the reference could undermine the protection of information provided for in Article 4”
              | (Council, par. 9a(2)). Sensitive documents are excluded likewise.

              | have to be listed,

              | accessible directly

              | no reference if this
              | could harm protection
              | as granted by the
              | exceptions,
              | no reference to any
              | sensitive documents
              | 4.2.3. Scope of the regulation
              | The regulation is intended to encompass “all documents held by an institution, that is to say,
              | documents drawn up by it or received from third parties and in its possession, in all areas of
              | activity of the European Union” (Council, par. 1(2)). The European Parliament makes a point
              | in stressing that ‘all areas’ refers to the 2nd and 3rd pillar as well. The Council agrees on that
              | with certain reservations stating that sensitive documents shall get a special treatment.
              | Commission, Parliament and Council are generous as far as the type of medium is
              | concerned. Written as well as electronic or sound, visual or audiovisual-recorded information
              | may be requested. Generosity stops here, and the approaches to exceptions vary
              | significantly in various fields. In case of the future EU-regulation, the European Parliament
              | offers the smallest number of exceptions. The draft foresees that access to documents can
              | be denied if disclosure could significantly undermine public security, monetary stability,
              | 16 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S
              | defense and military matters, and vital interest relating to the EU’s international relations (EP,
              | par. 4(1a)). Individual privacy is likewise protected. Commercial secrecy is mentioned under
              | the European Parliament’s exceptions, too, but has to be balanced against private or public
              | interest in case of disclosure. However, the European Parliament sets certain limits to the
              | protection by demanding that a classification is done immediately and shall be limited in
              | time. If access is denied for an unlimited period of time, the reason for withholding has to be
              | revised regularly (EP, par. 3a(2)).
              | The Commission’s initial proposal gives a much longer and detailed list of exceptions
              | including “the effective functioning of the institutions” (Comm, par. 4(1a)). This draft does not
              | require a “balancing test” as the European Parliament’s proposal does. The Council’s
              | position is similar to that of the Commission, but is outstanding in stating “[a]ccess to a
              | document which relates to a matter where the decision has not been taken by the Institutions
              | may be denied if its disclosure could seriously undermine the Institution’s decision-making
              | process, unless it is clearly in the public interest to disclose the document” (Council, par.
              | 4.2).
              | The Commission suggests likewise excluding “texts for internal use such as discussion
              | documents, opinions of departments, and excluding informal messages” (Comm par. 3a).
              | The two other concurrent drafts take also account of the so-called ‘space to think’ clause.
              | The Parliament’s draft limits its exceptions however to documents intended for exchange of
              | idea and brainstorming. The ‘space to think’ is limited to “informal information in the form of
              | written messages which serves the provision of personal opinion or the free exchange of
              | ideas (“brain storming”) within the institutions” (EP, par. 3a). The Council’s proposal
              | resembles the approach of the Commission in its subsequent paragraph, excluding
              | documents “for internal use as part of preliminary consultations and deliberations within the
              | institutions such as discussion documents, unfinished documents or draft documents and
              | documents whose content reflects personal opinions” (Council, par. 3a). The European
              | Parliament chooses obviously the most restrictive wording, but leaves broad space for future
              | interpretation, too.
              | Another source of divergence is the definition of those bodies subject to the proposed
              | regulation. Following the obligations of the Amsterdam Treaty, access to documents of the
              | Council, the European Parliament and the Commission has to be considered. The Council’s
              | draft makes no further provisions on that subject. Both Commission and EP define the
              | respective bodies more precisely. The EP mentions the “internal and subsidiary bodies (such
              | as Parliament Committees, Council Committees, Working Groups and Commission
              | Directorates-General)” (EP, par. 3b). The Commission’s draft is even more precise, citing
              | each body and the main subbodies (Comm, par. 3c,d,e). It also views the EP’s political
              | groups within the reach of the regulation, a provision that is missing in the EP’s draft.

              | A special point due to the nature of the EU polity is the insertion of provisions concerning
              | third parties. Whereas the definition of third parties remains the same for all three proposals
              | saying that ‘third party’ shall mean “any natural or legal person, or any entity outside the
              | institution, including the Member States, other Community and non-Community institutions
              | and bodies and non-member countries” (Comm, par. 3f, EP, par. 3f, Council, par. 3c), the
              | question of how to handle documents originating from third parties is contested. The crucial
              | point is, of course, the role of the Member States. The Commission suggests to grant
              | confidentiality according to the preferences of a Member State (Comm, par. 3d) and to apply
              | the regulation only for documents sent to the institutions after entry in force of the regulation
              | (Comm, par. 2 (1)). The European Parliament turns down this approach fearing an
              | undermining of the future regulation. It therefore suggests that Member States and other
              | third parties shall indicate reasons for withholding on the grounds of the exceptions laid
              | down in the EU-regulation on public access. The institution even has the right to decide
              | against the wishes of the third party but is at the same time under obligation to grant a
              | certain space of time to give the opportunity to search for legal intervention (EP, par. 4c). The
              | Council’s definite position on this point was not available for comparative analysis. In the
              | recital it is however laid down that Declaration No 35 attached to the Final Act of the Treaty
              | “will allow a Member State to request the Commission or the Council not to communicate to
              | third parties a document originating from that State without its prior agreement” (Council,
              | recital 9).
              | I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 19
              | Another possible scenario for request is not covered by the Commission’s proposal although
              | it has proven to be a touchstone between the Community institutions and a Member State.
              | The case of Sweden, releasing more documents under its presidency than the Council, has
              | highlighted the problematic nature of divergent information policies. The European
              | Parliament provides in this case that “the Member State shall immediately inform the
              | institution” (EP, par. 4d) but leaves it up to the Member State whether to disclose or not on
              | grounds of national legislation. In its justifications the European Parliament however
              | expresses the hope that the Member States respect the “spirit of loyal cooperation.” The
              | Council’s common position with regard to this point remains contested and unclear. The
              | wording, which does not get the agreement of all Member States, provides that the Member
              | State “should forward it promptly to this institution for a decision to be taken” (Council, recital
              | 14).

              | 4.3. The three proposals in terms of openness and transparency
              | When assessing the three positions offered by Commission, Parliament and Council, one
              | observes apparent differences in the shaping of openness and transparency. The European
              | Parliament clearly takes the most far-reaching position on granting access to documents. It
              | reaffirms the commitment of ready-at-hand information by introducing not only the shortest
              | time limit for answering to requests. It also offers the most detailed provisions concerning
              | public registers in terms of quick and extensive availability. The proposal is much more
              | generous towards repeated requests than the concurrent drafts. These are treated the same
              | way as all other requests. This is especially important given the aims that are to be fulfilled
              | by transparency and openness. The institutionalization of a European public sphere depends
              | on evolving intermediaries, which work on a regular basis. Interest groups, the media as well
              | 20 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S
              | as scientific research therefore need the possibility to access information without
              | discrimination.
              | The European Parliament’s draft is also far reaching with regard to the type of document.
              | Though the relevant provisions are somehow vague, the Parliament is clearly more
              | ambitious in granting access to as many documents as possible. This is especially important
              | for those papers drawn up in the initial stages of the policy-making cycle. Public availability
              | of internal documents allows an active participation in policy making as well as
              | accompanying control thus not only relying on ex-post accountability. The proposal is firm in
              | avoiding provisions, which would allow escaping from the regulation by including all three
              | pillars. It therefore denies the setting up of special codes of access granting less access than
              | once established. Wherever the necessity to withhold documents is conceded by its
              | proposal, the Parliament urges a balancing between conflicting interests. A regular revision
              | of classified documents shall moreover grant the strict commitment to the principle ‘as open
              | as possible’.
              | The Commission’s and the Council’s position are in contrast less open than the European
              | Parliament’s, although different points are highlighted. Both grant a degree of openness and
              | transparency that is not conducive to civic participation and even renders ex post
              | accountability more difficult. The Commission’s proposal encompasses the existing sub-
              | bodies and by doing so, follows the same principles as the Parliament. In deviation from the
              | Council’s position it restricts beneficiaries to legal and natural persons residing in the
              | European Union and is, therefore, less open than the Council. As far as the scope of the
              | future regulation is concerned, the Commission stresses the importance of granting
              | confidentiality in order to ensure the effective functioning of the institutions. Internal
              | documents are therefore largely covered by exceptions restricting access. A ‘harm test’ to
              | balance the applicants interest in disclosure towards the institution’s interest in confidentiality
              | is in no case provided.
              | The Council is even more restrictive than the Commission. The Council is less concerned
              | with internal “space to think”-provisions but considers the confidentiality of the decision-
              | making process. Although a ‘harm test’ is foreseen for internal documents concerning issues
              | where a decision has not yet been taken, it is restrictive in another area. It reaffirms its
              | commitment to include documents of all areas but foresees at the same time special
              | procedures for sensitive documents. This attitude is extended to the provisions on public
              | registers. Online registers, which list all documents and provide for direct access to the
              | actual paper, would enormously improve opportunities for participation and accountability
              | throughout Europe. The establishment of such registers would allow individuals and interest
              | groups, which are not located at Brussels to bridge the geographic distance and monitor EU
              | politics. Yet, the Council neglects the European Parliament’s considerations on speedy and
              | comprehensive access to registers. Even more important, it restricts the cases to be listed in
              | registers therefore hampering even ex post accountability. The Council is as restricted as the
              | I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 21
              | Commission in treating repeated requests or applications for large documents in a special
              | way.
              | Gronbech-Jensen stresses that the Commission has adopted several measures to
              | strengthen transparency since Amsterdam, e.g. by involving organized interests. By doing
              | so, it went much further than the Council (Gronbech-Jensen 1998: 191). However, when
              | focusing on public access to documents only, these findings have to be reconsidered. It is
              | mainly the European Parliament which acts as a motor for more transparency whereas the
              | Commission’s and the Council’s attitude reflect reservation on public access to documents.
              | 5. Conclusion
              | Transparency and openness as tools for democratic legitimacy stress the importance of
              | open, simple, and comprehensible policy-making. They are seen as prerequisites to hold
              | political leaders and administrative bodies accountable. Transparency and openness may
              | also prompt civic participation by allowing direct engagement in politics. The most basic
              | instrument to enhance transparency and openness is granting extensive access to
              | information. Access to information enables citizens and civic intermediaries to scrutinize the
              | political processes and to engage in them either directly or by means of public debate.
              | Access to information has been one of the means designed to strengthen the legitimacy of
              | the EU-polity. Since Amsterdam, this approach has been pursued and improvements in the
              | information policy and accessibility of the European Union through civil society have been
              | achieved.
              | The final shaping of the regulation on access would be subject to yet another paper. 3 In any
              | case, when studying the different suggestions on the regulation regarding public access to
              | European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, current institutional views on
              | transparency and openness turn out to be somehow dissatisfying. The different drafts of
              | Parliament, Commission, and Council reflect the aim to protect the institution’s most vital and
              | sensitive areas. The European Parliament is eager to exclude documents concerning party
              | deliberations, the Commission tries to shield internal administrative documents as far as
              | possible and the Council is anxious to protect its decision-making process. The comparison
              | of the drafts on the European Union’s regulation on public access to European Parliament,
              | Council and Commission documents shows that there is no overall perception and
              | conception of democracy, and eventual compromises will continue to reflect these
              | ambiguities.
              | 3 For in-depth analysis of the regulation see e.g. Jacobs 2001
              | 22 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S
              | Even very open systems like the Swedish one do exclude documents from public scrutiny for
              | various reasons. Taking this into account, the European Parliament’s position is still the most
              | far reaching with regard to an opening up the policy-making process by means of granting
              | access to documents. It suggests a speedy procedure, has no reservations on beneficiaries
              | and provides for extensive access to documents in almost all phases of the policy cycle and
              | in many policy fields. It is consequently outstanding in granting opportunities for both
              | accountability and participation. Commission and Council, in contrast, rely more heavily on
              | internal deliberations, which have to be protected up to some degree against the outside
              | world. The Council even renders ex post accountability more difficult. In following the
              | philosophy of diplomat’s secret deliberations, the Council provides for opportunities to hide
              | the very existence of documents. Hopefully, the strengthening of the Parliament’s position
              | has positive effects on better opportunities for civil society. It challenges contrasting views as
              | represented by Commission and Council and may well have some impact on existing power
              | relations, inherent attitudes and final political outcome.
              | Transparency and openness are double-edged weapons. If people use the channels open to
              | them, they may eventually conclude that they do not agree to what is going on in day-to-day
              | politics. An upgrading of democratic legitimacy by granting more access to information may
              | then have delegitimizing effects. Output-orientated approaches, stressing that democratic
              | legitimacy is best achieved by providing optimal political outcome, namely rules and laws on
              | behalf of the people’s demand, will remain sceptical about the positive effects of participation
              | and accountability through the highest possible degree of transparency and openness.
              | Conversely, one has to put up with possible unintended consequences of transparency if a
              | political system is to be created as a ‘democracy by the people’ instead of a ‘democracy for
              | the people’.
