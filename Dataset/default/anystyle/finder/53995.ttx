              | RESUMEN
              | Objective: estimating the prevalence of venous ulcers and identifying the sociodemographic, behavioral,
              | of health factors, the characteristics of the wound and treatment associated among individuals adults met
              | in a health centre of Vitória da Conquista- BA. Method: this is a cross-sectional study in which there were
              | studied 42 individuals. The statistical analyzes were performed using Epi Info version 3.5.3. Results: the
              | prevalence of venous ulcers was of 83,3%, being higher in females (95,5%). The factors that remained
              | associated were: sex, living together, diabetes, chronic venous insufficiency, pain, start time of the first
              | recurrence of ulcers and wounds. Conclusion: the results suggest the need for further researches to
              | improve national records about venous ulcers and enable strategies to ensuring better health care based
              | on scientific and clinical evidence.Descriptors: Varicose ulcer, Nursing care, Health profile.

              | INTRODUCTION
              | C
              | hronic wounds can be seen as lesions of difficult healing and of frequent
              | recurrence, usually from multiple systemic problems.1 Usually they are not seen as a
              | pressing public health problem, although representing a common, complex and costly
              | condition2, since interfere with several of the individual life of the components, such as
              | mobility, sleep and rest, and cause stress, anxiety, severe pain and persistent in many
              | cases.1-2 They are of multifactorial etiology, such as venous disease, arterial, diabetic
              | neuropathy, cancer, and metabolic, hematologic and infectious and parasitic diseases.3
              | Among the above mentioned etiologies, there are the venous ulcers, conceptually
              | defined as a tissue loss in the extremities due to a vascular dysfunction4,5, due to a failure
              | in valvular6 system or due to factors such as venous obstruction caused by varicose veins,
              | evil valve formation, venous hypertension, venous occlusion by clot causing venous
              | hypertension and occasioning the ulcer of this etiology.3 The most common are chronic leg
              | ulcers3, and can reach a rate of 80% and may affect from youth to old age.7
              | International studies indicate that the occurrence of venous ulcers increases with
              | age.2,8 Some previous studies in Brazil showed an association of venous ulcers with low
              | income and education9,10, single and recurring lesions3,7,11 and presence of pain process.10
              | However, we can see some little statistical data on the prevalence of this type of ulcer in
              | the country and in different regions, as well as the factors associated with the history of the
              | wound and its treatment, which implies the underestimation of the problem.
              | Care for individuals with this type of problem, led by nurses and developed in
              | community clinics, as has been strongly supported in the UK, since the late 90's.2 A similar
              | project developed in London showed that before and after a 12-week audit this type
              | service, of leg ulcers healing rates improved from 22% to 69% with the new service.12 In
              | Brazil, the nurse integrates stomatherapy teams, whether in outpatient or hospital network,
              | and has different functions ranging from assessment injuries and execution of dressing as
              | well as the development of educational activities and the realization of referrals.7
              | The venous leg ulcers constitute an important psychosocial burden, financial and in
              | terms of morbidity for their patients and for health services and the knowledge of its
              | prevalence and associated factors can contribute to a better nursing care and
              | multidisciplinary. Thus, this study aimed to estimating the prevalence of venous leg ulcers
              | among adults treated at the Victoria da Conquista Health Centre - BA and identify
              | sociodemographic factors, health and wound characteristics and its treatment associated
              | with this event.

              | METHOD
              | This article comes from a larger study called the "characteristics of patients with
              | lower limb ulcers treated at a health center in the countryside of Bahia, 2011," in which
              | multiple health outcomes were investigated.
              | There was conducted in a Health Center (CS) located in the city of Vitoria da
              | Conquista, in the Southwest of Bahia. This is the only Municipal outpatient specialized and
              | reference to patients with chronic lesions, consisting of a multidisciplinary team, among
              | them, a medical specialist, nurses and nursing technicians. There were registered in the
              | service during the period of data collection about 800 patients, this number refers to both
              | individuals followed by the specialized service, and by individuals who perform episodic
              | contacts with the same for the execution of dressing less complex or withdrawal points.
              | Health Center meets from patients with chronic ulcers or difficult treatment referred from
              | the Family Health Units and other health centers, as well as patients from spontaneous
              | demand. Patients with higher morbidity or complications of other comorbidities such as
              | diabetes mellitus are referred to hospitals.
              | The sample was non-probabilistic, random and without repetition, and for obtaining
              | were approached all eligible patients in the study of the occurrence period (January to
              | March 2011) that met the following criteria: patients had lower limb ulcers, over 18 years
              | old, in attendance in CS the dressing rooms in the period of data collection. There were
              | excluded those with ulcers in another part of the body other than the lower limbs and those
              | who were not in the CS to perform curative but due to other reasons.
              | The interviews were conducted by researchers in every day and functioning of the
              | service hours and occurred at the time that individuals awaiting service, when the
              | impossibility of doing so in the same day, a new schedule is made for the nearest day for
              | attendance at the CS, a fact that happened to one individual. Thus, all 43 individuals
              | addressed expressly agreed to participating in the study by signing the Informed Consent
              | Form (ICF) and the refusal rate was zero.
              | Just prior to data collection a pre-test was conducted in order to verifying
              | instrument feasibility and conditions for conducting research. The individuals interviewed in
              | this phase were not included in the final study sample.
              | To obtaining data we used a structured form; it contained sociodemographic
              | variables (gender, age, education, marital status, color/race, income, living arrangements
              | and place of residence); health variables: (hours of sleep per night, physical mobility, pain,
              | type 2 diabetes, hypertension and chronic venous insufficiency); and variables on the
              | history and treatment of the wound: (wound start time, presence of wound recurrence,
              | number of wounds, frequency of exchange of toppings and place of the healing).
              | The above variables were used as potential factors associated with venous ulcers.

              | through self-report and dichotomized as venous ulcers and not venous ulcers. Although some
              | studies have been based on clinical judgment of the lower limbs and established a set of
              | clinical indicators for classification of venous ulcers, we decided to using the self-report
              | validated by the diagnostics of medical records, since there was no difference between this
              | and the diagnosis prior.
              | There were interviewed 43 people, and from this total there was excluded 1 (2,32%)
              | individual who did not answer the question on the etiological hypothesis of the wound and
              | which was not found diagnosis in the medical record.
              | The analytical plan included the estimation of the prevalence of types of ulcers
              | stratified by sex and for all individuals, using both descriptive statistical procedures. For the
              | analysis of associated factors (sociodemographic variables, health and variables related to
              | the history and treatment of the wound) the venous ulcers, the chi-square test of Pearson
              | or Fisher exact tests were performed. Were considered statistically significant differences
              | less than or equal to 5% (p = 0,05). The data collected was used Epi Info software version
              | 3.5.3 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA).
              | The research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Municipal Health
              | Secretariat of Vitoria da Conquista – BA; and by the Research Ethics Committee of the State
              | University of Southwest Bahia (UESB), under Opinion No 199/2010 and CAAE: 0033.0.454000-
              | 10. All individuals have expressed agreement with the free and informed consent (IC) and
              | signed it.
              | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
              | A prevalence of 83,3% of venous ulcers and 17,7% of non-venous ulcers (15,3% of
              | neurotrophic ulcers and 2,4% of traumatic ulcers) for the general population was found.
              | When stratified by gender, we identified a higher prevalence of venous ulcers among
              | women (95,5%) and the lowest prevalence of ulcers in this other sex too (4,5%) compared
              | with men (FIGURE 1).

              | Prevalence of venous…
              | The prevalence of venous ulcers among individuals analyzed in this study was of great
              | magnitude, resembling that found in the United States, where 80% of leg ulcers are due to
              | rise of venous ulcers 6, similar to that found in Juiz de Fora - MG (79%)5 and less than that
              | found in Goiania, whose prevalence was 61%. 13 The lower prevalence of venous ulcers in
              | Goiania may be related to the fact that they have been clinically evaluated, besides the
              | patients were recruited in Basic Units of dressing rooms of Health13, in contrast to the
              | present study which the classification of ulcers was based on self-report and by checking
              | on records and performed in a specialized service and reference in the treatment of
              | wounds.
              | The major predominance of venous ulcers in females corroborates with two studies in
              | Minas Gerais5,14, and may reflect hormonal and gestational aspects involved in this
              | susceptibility, and socio-cultural aspects that make women seek more health services
              | men15. However, the predominance in males also have a tendency is observed in some
              | regional studies7,9 confirming that this situation is not only characteristic of women.
              | When analyzing the factors associated with venous ulcers, it was observed that some
              | sociodemographic and health characteristics may be contributing to the construction of
              | the profile of patients affected by this type of ulcers. Among the sociodemographic
              | factors, beyond sex, family arrangement was the only one that remained associated with
              | venous ulcers. Higher prevalence of this disease in women has also been mentioned in
              | other studies.5,8,14 A plausible explanations for the association between living together and
              | the presence of venous ulcers may be related to greater responsibility in caring for the
              | family and housework14, and therefore less time for self-care, however, this association
              | needs further investigation.
              | Among the surveyed morbidity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic venous
              | insufficiency constitute relevant associations before countless other factors that may
              | influence the onset of venous ulcers and depict the importance of both the control as the
              | treatment of these morbidities. Higher proportion of patients with chronic venous
              | insufficiency was found among those who had venous ulcers in this study, which confirms
              | previous study which showed that venous ulcers match 70-90% of all leg ulcers16. The
              | chronic venous insufficiency can bring aesthetic and functional complications and its most
              | exuberant manifestation venosa6 ulcer. It is engaged with the increase in venous pressure,
              | which damages the hair and make it more permeable, allowing the exit of several
              | molecules, generating eczema caused by the degradation of hemoglobin; edema due to the
              | accumulation of interstitial fluid, hyperpigmentation and lipodermatosclerosis.6,15 In those
              | circumstances, a venous ulcer can be developed either using a light trauma, such as due to
              | a collision with a mobile, or even spontaneously.1,17
              | Regarding diabetes mellitus, its absence was associated with higher prevalence of
              | venous ulcers. It is important reporting that these findings are consistent with the low
              | frequency of venous ulcers due to causes such as diabetes.5 This finding may also be partly
              | attributed due to the sample size. In line with the above, about 20% of diabetic patients
              | develop lower limb ulcers at some point in their lives and their development may be
              | associated with both neuropathic and vascular changes.18 Diabetic neuropathy, chronic
              | complication of this disease, can lead the decrease or loss of tactile, thermal, painful,

              | The association between the occurrence of pain and the presence of venous ulcers is
              | well established and is in agreement with other studies.19,20 The painful component can
              | represent as well as an exacerbation of the inflammatory phase and delay the healing
              | process21, an important factor actor in the quality of life of individuals with venous
              | ulcers.10,16
              | Regarding the history of the wounds, the highest prevalence of individuals with
              | venous ulcers were found among those who had more than 10 years of start of the first ulcer
              | and among those who had recurrence of the wound, which denotes a situation of chronic
              | wounds, these findings also indicated in other studies.9,22,23 This situation can still picture a
              | greater demand for health services both with regard to the mobilization of human, material
              | and structural as well as the impact this has on the quality of life of individuals affected,
              | requiring greater health care.7 Nevertheless, the fact of the individuals come from a
              | referral center for the treatment of wounds, may represent greater complexity of the
              | lesions, explaining in part the results.
              | It is noteworthy that, with regard to the treatment to the healing of venous ulcers
              | and improves venous return, it is recommended that it should be provided by doctors,
              | nurses and other professionals with the joint participation of the patient, with
              | compression therapy one of the pillars,6,15 with a view to reducing edema and venous
              | stasis.7 Yet, regarding the treatment of venous ulcers, although not statistically
              | significant, most patients reported using the Health Center and the home to carry out the
              | roofing trade. Like most of venous ulcers can recur in up to 70% of cases3,7, and all the
              | cases that had relapsed venous ulcers in this study, the use of the Health Center and the
              | household as care environments may reflect this need to equip the individuals’ conditions
              | and knowledge to receive care and self-care. However, it is known that the
              | decentralization of care for the individual to perform the dressing in his home, it involves

              | Because they are venous ulcers so prevalent in the analyzed context, they require

              | CONCLUSION
              | The results showed that venous ulcers are common health problems among adults in
              | ascribed rated service and the associated factors such as gender, living arrangements, type
              | 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic venous insufficiency, pain and time of beginning of the first
              | ulcer are consistently observed at other national-scale studies. These findings are
              | configured as input for the preparation of planning, prevention and treatment relevant to
              | this subject in order to enhancing the chances of successful treatment, contributing to the
              | reduction of recidivism, healing without complications, reduced spending improving the
              | health and quality of life.
              | However, a limitation highlights the difficulty of cross-sectional studies in
              | establishing temporal relationship, because of the exposure and the outcomes are measured
              | simultaneously. The fact that the response variable have been based on self-report,
              | although less accurate than the clinical evaluation of the ulcer, had the advantage of being
              | inexpensive and more likely to be replicated with large samples.
              | In this light, there is the importance of further research in different scenarios and
              | with more representative samples in order to improving national records about venous
              | ulcers and other etiologies and enable strategies to ensuring better health care based on
              | scientific evidences and substantial clinics.
