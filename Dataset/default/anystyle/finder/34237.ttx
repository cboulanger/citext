              | Abstract: The last decades have seen a deepening of paradiplomacy which is an especially
              | important phenomenon for the federal states. This development became a source of change in
              | the constitutions of federal states in order to trace prospects and limits for such process. Brazil
              | is part of the group of states where non-central governments reaching beyond the national
              | borders have occurred without a legal framework specific to the issue. In a federal state known
              | for its centralization like Brazil such discussion can be harsh but its relevance to local and
              | regional development and to the balance of the federative pact turns is necessary.

text          | Introduction
              | Recent years have seen a deepening of studies on the international action of the so-
              | called sub-national1 governments. It is an especially important phenomenon for federal
              | states, since existing democratic regimes and federalism as a form of the state are
              | considered relevant internal factors for the development of international relations of
              | subnational governments (Vigevani 2006). Therefore, although it is not a phenomenon
              | unique to federal states, the international insertion of non-central government has
              | developed with some frequency and success in this form of state which makes this a
              | relevant theme for the understanding of the contemporary contours of federalism.
              | This development has meant that some federations have adapted their legislation
              | to draw up the perspectives and limits of the international action of sub-national
              | governments. Brazil is part of a group of states where non-central governments,
              | reaching beyond the national borders, have formed without a legal framework dictating
              | the process. This article seeks to understand how Brazilian national legal regulations
              | have dealt with this phenomenon and how the process of legal framing of
              | paradiplomacy is developing to meet the challenges this trend engenders.
              | Initially, I analyze the actions of sub-national governments in international
              | development, concentrating specifically on the causes themselves and their growth.
              | Then the tendencies of the constitutionalization of the international relations
              | undertaken by sub-national governments will be examined, before moving on to review
              | the efforts to make it part of the law system in Brazil. Finally, I review the
              | consequences of un-constitutionalized paradiplomacy.
              | 1. The Development of Paradiplomacy
              | Paradiplomacy refers to international action by non-central governments2 (Soldatos
              | 1990).3 Widespread international action of federal entities began before the 1970s and
              | 1980s. Explanations for this development range from factors internal to federations
              | through to aspects acquired by the international system in recent decades (Keating
              | 1999, Romero 2004).
              | Within federal states the drivers of paradiplomacy often include the division of
              | competencies and autonomy given to sub-units through federative pacts. The need for
              | members of the federation to fulfill competencies laid out by Constitutional charters

text          | Academically, it would be correct to use the term “sub-state governments”, given the
              | distinction between State and Nation. However, due to the fact that it is generally accepted in
              | literature, the expression “sub-national governments” will be used in this paper. In the same
              | way, the term “non-central governments” will be used to refer to these entities, in contrast to
              | “central governments”.
              | The term “non-central government” should be understood in a broad way, meaning a
              | constituent unit of a federal country or an administrative division of a unitary state.
              | On possible discussions about the nomenclature, see: Zabala 2000; Romero 2004.

text          | requires that members seek ways of meeting local and regional demands not fully met
              | by the central government. Furthermore states’ reduced participation in their national
              | economies in the 1980s and 1990s with the spread of neo-liberal economic policy
              | began to be seen as an important instrument for the improvement of sub-national
              | public policies. This movement is facilitated, in the case of federations, because of
              | greater autonomy granted by central governments; unlike what has been seen to occur
              | in unitary states.
              | Also the evolution of the international system in recent decades has driven
              | paradiplomacy. The beginning of international action by non-central governments took
              | place in the larger context of the democratization of the international system; a process
              | that began after the Second World War (Sassen 2001.) Therefore an important change
              | occurred in the once exclusively inter-state system which had dominated the
              | international arena since the 17th century. Although states remain the primary actors in
              | this scenario, the acceleration of international flows – or globalization – and the
              | development of regional integration processes have facilitated the emergence of
              | important new players to a once foreign sphere.
              | The processes of globalization and regional integration create favorable conditions
              | for the increased action of sub-national governments in the foreign sphere. Waves of
              | migration for example, bring about the need for non-central governments to deal with
              | cultural and linguistic diversity that increase the probability of closer bonds with foreign
              | institutions and governments. Furthermore, the expansion of multinational corporations
              | has meant that sub-national governments need to develop policies focused on
              | economic internationalization, preparing their population and territory for the arrival of
              | foreign investments.
              | The changes accompany a corresponding change in the approach of international
              | problem solving; moving from a state-centric approach to one welcoming input from
              | constituent units. The perception that regional and local level governments must be
              | included in problem-solving efforts related to these issues led to a greater
              | consideration of these spheres in efforts of international agencies and organizations.4
              | There is a tendency for paradiplomacy to supplement the activities of non-central
              | governments in their sphere of competence with the unique aspect that they go beyond
              | national frontiers. In extremely rare cases, the international relations of sub-national
              | governments go against the foreign policy of the federal government or encroach into
              | jurisdictions outside of a given non-central government. 5

text          | Therefore, during the 1990s, the United Nations held large conferences which were drivers
              | for sub-national governments, and, above all, the local powers were able to establish
              | themselves on the international scene (Rodrigues 2004, p. 441). Along the same line, in
              | 2000, the United Nations launched the Goals of the Millenium, considered one of the most
              | important programs currently run by the institution. Through this, the UN has sought to
              | involve regional and local governments, understanding that the solution for the big problems
              | affecting states today need to be dealt with at the sub-national level.
              | This kind of foreign relations by sub-national governments is called protodiplomacy and has
              | been more widely studied in the autonomous regions of Spain (Segura 2004).

text          | In Brazil paradiplomacy started to move forward more firmly in the 1980s, with the
              | redemocratization of the country after years of military dictatorship.6 A symbol of the
              | new democratic phase, the federal constitution of 1988 formally entrenched the right of
              | common citizens to participate in the democratic process. The constitution incorporated
              | both the relevance of consensus and the need for the participation of minorities.
              | However the constitution also brought considerable administrative and political
              | decentralization through greater tax distribution and an extension of the sharing of
              | competences between federal entities. There is a greater autonomy of member states
              | and,7 since they gained greater autonomy over the budgets, a larger number of
              | competing competences.8
              | During the 1980s, following the paths of the world economy and the crisis of the
              | development-state based ideology of the 1970s; the Brazilian economy went through
              | an important period of adjustments. Brazil joined the new wave of economic liberalism
              | that affected most of the Western world. As part of the adaptation to this new context,
              | the federal government started an intensified process of economic deregulation, the
              | privatization of public corporations and opening to foreign capital. In practice, this
              | meant a reduction of the nation state in domestic affairs and a greater opening to the
              | international market.
              | During the transition to economic liberalism, a reduction in the economic and
              | financial actions of the central government created a vacuum. This vacuum was then
              | filled by the sub-national entities and municipalities of Brazil. The seizing of
              | opportunities provided by foreign investment appeared as an appealing alternative to
              | other options that were advanced to deal with the issues which were arising (Barreto
              | 2004). Brazilian sub-national governments have being specially active in seeking
              | international loans and attracting foreign investments by tax incentives for multinational
              | enterprises.
              | There is some consensus in the literature about what promotes international
              | organizations to seek constituent level input in federations. Michael Keating was one of
              | the first scholars to define three general groups of such motivations that fit the Brazilian
              | situation, these causes are economic, political and cultural (Keating 2004). In the
              | economic sphere, it is sought after international funding, as well as foreign investments
              | and increased exports of locally produced goods. In the political sphere, agreements
              | 6 It is true that some international actions of member states can be seen since the 1960s.
              | There was the protest of the then Governor of the State of Rio Grande do Sul against the
              | federal government for not taking part in the negotiations for the creation of the Latin
              | American Free Trade Association and also the creation of the International Relations
              | Secretariat in the State of Minas Gerais. Although they were important initiatives bringing the
              | theme of internationalization to sub-national governments, they were isolated initiatives.
              | 7 The 1988 federal constitution included the municipalities as members of the Brazilian
              | federation, inaugurating a three-way federal system.
              | 8 This does not mean, however, that Brazil is a truly decentralized federation. With the
              | constitution of 1988 there was a move towards decentralization, when compared to previous
              | periods, but the country still has a strongly centralized structure.

text          | are made to empower local public policies and disseminate best practices as well as
              | carry the needs of sub-national governments to the international system – through
              | networks of cities and bilateral agreements, for example. In the cultural sphere, sub-
              | national governments seek agreements that deal with migratory flows and which allow
              | greater visibility to increase tourism.
              | Therefore, it can be seen that the pragmatics of paradiplomacy in Brazil – as well
              | as in other countries where this phenomenon occurs – can involve a variety of
              | agreements from contracts to international agreements. There are different degrees of
              | commitment taken on by sub-national governments which raises questions about the
              | legal aspects of the phenomenon.
              | 2. Tendencies of Constitutionalization of Paradiplomacy in Federal States
              | International law only recognizes as unquestioned legal entities the states and
              | international organizations – as well as a few entities close to these two categories
              | (Shaw, 2003). Therefore, from the traditional view of international relations, there is no
              | clear answer as to what the legal reach of sub-national governments is the international
              | system. To rectify this issue, governments should turn to national norms as guidelines
              | to define acceptable state action (Pellet 2002). This depends essentially on the degree
              | of decentralization of the federation: the higher decentralization is the greater the
              | probability of constitutional permission for paradiplomacy.
              | The Brazilian federal constitution does not foresee international relationships
              | between sub-national governments, the federal district (Brasília, the federal capital)
              | and municipalities (Rodrigues 2008, p. 1019). In spite of this, the practice of foreign
              | interaction with states has become deeper and more widespread among the sub-
              | national governments. The distance between practice and law in the sphere of
              | paradiplomacy has a reason. It is difficult to create an appropriate legal framework that
              | can deal with the complexity of the process, as well as its dynamics.
              | However the constitutionalization of paradiplomacy may bring restrictions to the
              | international action of the sub-national entities. Therefore, in understanding the
              | obstacles of a possible constitutional reform, it is important to analyze the standards
              | adopted by federal states in adapting their legal frameworks with regard to (a) the kind
              | of norms utilized, and (b) the material competencies designated, as well as (c) the
              | limits established.
              | a) Norms: By definition, the federal constitution is the basic document which deals
              | with the division of competencies between federated entities; therefore, it should be the
              | main instrument to define the possibility and the limits of paradiplomacy (Rezek 2005.)
              | With paradiplomacy foreseen in the constitution, it follows the principle of legality,
              | inherent to administrative law which means that all actions of the public administration
              | should be guided by law. The federal constitution should establish the areas where
              | involvement of the sub-national entities would be suitable and, therefore, underline the

text          | centralization of power-- whether in the federation itself, or in the member states
              | (Moraes 1998, p. 28).
              | Therefore, in most cases, the rules regulating international actions by members of
              | the federation have been done through constitutional amendments. That is what
              | happened in Belgium, with the constitutional reform of 1993, in Argentina in 1994 and,
              | in Austria in 2002. A different understanding of the issue occurred in the Mexican
              | federation, which chose to normatize paradiplomacy through an infra-constitutional law.
              | In spite of the outspoken disagreement of the local constitutionalists with regard to the
              | suitability of this decree (Abraham 2007, p. 280). Since 1992 Mexico has had the “Law
              | of Celebration of Treaties” which widens the possibility of international participation with
              | some autonomy by sub-national entities. Therefore, although the Mexican constitution
              | affirms the impossibility of international agreements by non-central governments, an
              | infra-constitutional norm admits this possibility.
              | b) Material competences: With regard to the issues about which the federal
              | subunits may deal with in international agreements, it is usually established that they
              | may make agreements on any issue within their sphere of competence. The Swiss
              | constitution, for example, foresees the possibility of agreements between cantons and
              | foreign states, in which they must limit themselves to the competences of federated
              | entities. The German constitution is similar, indicating the possibility of member states
              | celebrating international agreements in the sphere of their attributions. The Austrian
              | Constitution, which indicates that the Länder may sign treaties with states of
              | neighboring Austria or with other states, as long as they are within the competences
              | attributed to them.
              | To a lesser extent, there are cases in which federated entities only deal with
              | issues related to their exclusive competences. This occurs often in Belgium. Although
              | in theory the Belgian Constitution allows for the possibility of agreements by
              | communities and regions on issues within their competence, in practice, these
              | agreements mostly focus on issues of education and culture, which are exclusive
              | competences of sub-national governments. In practical terms, there is in the Belgian
              | case, a sharing of competences on treaties issues.
              | The fact is that, without exception, legal provisions dealing with paradiplomacy
              | pigeon-hole state government into dealing with issues of low politics; like trade, culture
              | and those issues that are not directly related to sovereignty or national security. This
              | can be seen in the constitutional dynamics of the federated states, which attributes to
              | the central government the competence to deal with issues related to high politics.9
              | c) Limits: The constitutionalization of paradiplomacy does not occur without
              | precise limits. Besides the issue of delineating competences, there are also procedural
              | limits for sub-national governments to operate internationally. The most common

              | and high politics, since that, in an interdependent world, they tend to overlap with some

              | approval vary. Some states grant the executive power; for example the ministry
              | responsible for foreign affairs has the authority to approve or not approve a negotiation
              | or agreement. In others, the Legislative branch has the power to approve these
              | agreements.
              | This limit imposed by some constitutions – in fact most of them – has a negative
              | implication on the dynamics of paradiplomacy. The international actions of non-central
              | governments begin even before there is a constitutional reference about them – as in
              | the Brazilian case. Therefore, when the matter becomes constitutionalized and begins
              | to require that every agreement should be previously approved by a central
              | government agency, the celerity of the movement is lost. Some interesting solutions
              | have been found to counter-act this problem. In Austria, the federal government must
              | be informed by the governor of the Land before negotiations of an international
              | agreement are initiated and then it has eight weeks to issue a decision. If there is no
              | refusal during this period, it is tacitly understood that the request has been approved,
              | and the state government may start the negotiations.
              | Another interesting case is that of the United States. The federal constitution says
              | that the federated subunits may have agreements abroad, with the stipulation that the
              | state has the approval of U.S. Congress for the agreement to take effect. The
              | interpretation of this condition was initially restrictive, in the understanding that
              | Congress should be consulted about any foreign actions by non-central governments.
              | The intensification of paradiplomacy increased the scope – which was possible mostly
              | due to the fact that the United States is governed by a common law system. With the
              | dramatic increase of the number of agreements signed by single states today, there is
              | not full compliance with the constitutional requirement of a consultation to the U.S.
              | Congress (Lessa 2002, p. 41.) Many of these agreements are carried out directly
              | between the parties to save time. U.S. Congress itself, understanding the risk of its
              | operations could be compromised due to the number of agreements to be approved,
              | has interpreted that only agreements which interfere with security and the guidelines of
              | national foreign policy should be examined (Branco 2006, p.71.)
              | The policy of approval works both ways as there can also be issues of
              | compatibility with the foreign policy followed by central government. This fact is related
              | to the classical view that the nation state should be seen as a unit in the international
              | system. This would be mitigated by policies on paradiplomacy that did not follow the
              | guidelines dictated by central government. In the same way, internal governability
              | could be damaged if agreements of sub-national governments went against the
              | interests of the federal government. This issue arises in commitments taken on by the
              | federal state. The agreements should not fail to harmonize with previous obligations
              | assumed by central government whether in the national or international spheres.

text          | 3. In search of a legally ordained paradiplomacy in Brazil
              | In recent years, the discussion on the need to legally ordain paradiplomacy has led to
              | an attempt to constitutionalize the matter as well as some efforts at infra-constitutional
              | legal framing.
              | In 2005 the constitutional amendment proposal no. 475 was sent to the Brazilian
              | congress. The amendment no. 475 regulated the action of member states, the federal
              | district and municipalities internationally. It did so through an addition to the
              | constitutional law that dealt with competences common to federated entities. If
              | approved, the constitution would state that these entities could bring about acts and
              | sign agreements or contracts with sub-national foreign governments, as long as the
              | constitutional competences for each entity were followed and the competences which
              | are exclusive to the union be avoided. The constitution, justice, and citizenship
              | committee of the national congress argued that the lack of explicit permission in the
              | constitution about international actions by federated members was not sufficient reason
              | to forbid it. The argument of the committee, although contrary to the majority view on
              | this issue, which states the need for the competences of federated entities to be stated
              | in the constitution, prevailed and the constitutional amendment proposal was rejected.
              | This was followed by attempts of non-constitutional legal framing. There is a
              | proposal in senate today10 substituting white paper supplementary law no. 98 from
              | 2006. This proposal rules on the possibility of member states, municipalities and
              | federal district to act in the foreign sphere through signing agreements, which should
              | be examined previously by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is difficult to imagine how
              | approval could be attained with efficiency for Brazilian municipalities, which today
              | number over 5,500.
              | Besides the substitution proposal, there are two protocols in congress, signed by
              | the Brazilian federal government with the governments of France and Italy that seek to
              | provide a framework for paradiplomacy between the states in agreements. The
              | protocols indicate the importance of this movement and establish possible modalities of
              | the action of sub-national governments – in areas of their competence – as well as the
              | need for prior consent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the signing of agreements.
              | 4. Consequences of the lack of legal framing
              | The lack of legal framing of paradiplomacy has both positive and negative
              | consequences in the Brazilian case. There a legitimate concern by the sub-national
              | governments that, in inserting paradiplomacy in the legal framework, the limits are too
              | wide and the process becomes limited. These are almost inherent consequences to
              | phenomena that develop outside legal principles. To imagine that each negotiation or
              | agreement carried out today at the initiative of sub-national governments has then to
              | be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the national congress is very
              | 10 As of the writing of this paper in July 2010.

text          | disturbing for those who are already part of the process and this is not because of the
              | concern that the agreement might be refused. Paradiplomacy in Brazil, in spite of the
              | lack of an actual legal framework, does not tend to usurp competences of other
              | spheres or to act contrary to the foreign policy of the country. The greater concern is
              | the amount of red tape that will bind down a process that ought to be dynamic in order
              | to truly attain its objectives.
              | On the other hand, a negative consequence of the lack of constitutionalization of
              | the phenomenon is the lack of guidance on the practice of sub-national international
              | relations. Also, an important concern is the possibility that state and municipal public
              | administration could have their actions questioned in court or in a court of auditors
              | because they are beyond their constitutional competences. So far this has not occurred
              | for the executive power11. However, it is necessary to observe that the forms of
              | interaction of non-central governments in the international system have become
              | sophisticated, which raises the possibility of some kind of inspection.
              | Another important issue related to the lack of a legal framework is the
              | responsibility for international agreements that are not upheld. In the Brazilian case, it
              | is not clear who would be responsible for default on agreements made by sub-national
              | governments. With the possibility of new government cycles, this hypothesis is
              | especially serious because of the possible default on commitments assumed by
              | previous governments.
              | Conclusion
              | As happened in other countries, Brazil faces a troublesome dichotomy on the
              | constitutionalization of paradiplomacy. There is no easy answer to the issue since the
              | contours of possible legislation on the theme can vary stalling the process. It is true
              | that the debates on the issue in Brazil are still at too early a stage to draw up an
              | adequate legal framing. Carrying out a constitutional reform that is coherent both with
              | the Brazilian legal system and the demands of the federal government and of the sub-
              | national governments seems unlikely at this time. This does not, however, reduce the
              | importance of deepening the dialogue. On the contrary, it reaffirms the need.
              | 11 There are two lawsuits by the Rio Grande do Sul Public Prosecutor’s Office in Novo
              | Hamburgo, questioning travel by town counselors accompanying the mayor on trips abroad.
              | One of them is against 24 counselors and ex-counselors for mismanagement of public
              | resources because of trips in 2004, 2005 and 2007. Besides those that benefited with their
              | expenses being paid, the Public Prosecutor’s Office also targets counselors who voted in the
              | plenary in favor of the trips to France, China and the Iberian Peninsula. According to the
              | counselors, the missions had the purpose of drawing together Brazilian and foreign
              | companies and getting to know the technology of the countries visited. Another lawsuit refers
              | to trips to India in 2008. The Public Prosecutor’s Office does not question the possibility of
              | municipal authorities defending local interests in the foreign sphere, but the need for
              | representatives from the Legislative to do so (Dutra 2008).
