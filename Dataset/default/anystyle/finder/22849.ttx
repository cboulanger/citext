              | This study examined whether differences in the endorsement of the ‘Protestant Work Ethic’
              | (PWE) are related to motivation losses in group work. Three factors were derived from male
              | student scores on the Mirels–Garrett Protestant Work Ethic Scale, Ho’s Australian Work Ethic
              | Scale and a scale designed to assess preferences for reward distributions: instrumental value of
              | work, ethical value of work and normative value of equity. The study assessed motivation loss in
              | two situations; one designed to promote free-rider effects and another designed to promote
              | sucker effects. Results showed that the sucker effect was moderated by all three factors but in
              | qualitatively different ways whereas the free rider effect was not strongly moderated by any of
              | the PWE factors.

              | Many important tasks cannot be completed by
              | single individuals, but can only be accomplished
              | by groups. Many tasks in organizations require
              | members of teams to pool their individual con-
              | tributions in order to reach the group goal (e.g.
              | Antoni, 1994). However, teamwork does not
              | always work out as intended. In some instances,
              | the group product is satisfying; in other instances,
              | the group is far from achieving their productive
              | potential.
              | The failure of groups to realize their poten-
              | tial group productivity has been thoroughly
              | investigated and is a well established ﬁnding.
              | Decreased productivity can be the result of co-
              | ordination losses, but it is also a result of effort
              | reduction stemming from motivation losses

              | (Latane, Williams, & Harkins, 1979; Steiner,
              | 1972). One proposed reason for motivation losses
              | is that individuals might realize that their con-
              | tribution cannot be identiﬁed and thus evaluated
              | (Harkins & Jackson, 1985). Furthermore, group
              | members may perceive their contributions as
              | dispensable and hence reduce their effort while
              | free-riding on the contributions of the others
              | (Kerr & Bruun, 1983). These explanations assume
              | that the basic motivation of each individual
              | cannot be intrinsic to working per se or to maxi-
              | mize the group’s utility. It is rather assumed that
              | the basic motivation of each individual consists in
              | maximizing individual utility, hence maximizing
              | the individual input–output ratio, an assumption
              | underlying neoclassical economics.
              | Group work can be viewed as a social dilemma
              | (Kerr, 1983) inasmuch as the strategy ‘not to con-
              | tribute to the group product’ dominates the
              | strategy ‘to contribute’, no matter what the other
              | group members are doing. However if no one
              | contributes, the collective is worse off as the
              | group does not produce. In other words, group
              | members have an incentive to defect as long as
              | their contributions are additive and the mem-
              | bers’ main aim is to achieve a maximal individual
              | outcome. But pursuing that strategy is not
              | conducive to group productivity, and hence in
              | conﬂict with the collective interest.
              | The products of groups have an enormous
              | significance in our lives. In the past, when
              | manufacturing was the predominant industry,
              | the pooling of physical effort was important.
              | More recently, as more jobs are generated in the
              | knowledge industry, joint effort in cognitive tasks
              | has gained in importance. Examples of collect-
              | ive effort on cognitive tasks include writing
              | a joint report, developing a commercial com-
              | puter program, or operating an air trafﬁc control
              | system. In addition, globalization is leading to
              | faster moving societies and changing traditional
              | values. Values like modesty, diligence and honesty
              | have the taste of being old-fashioned, while
              | self-actualization, pursuing a career and cultivat-
              | ing a healthy narcissism are on the agenda
              | (e.g. Hogan & Blake, 1996). If the spirit of the
              | 21st century is dominated by pursuing one’s own
              | individual goals, and on the other hand, team
meta          | 40
text          | work is important, then an issue arises as to what
              | types of people can work effectively in teams.
              | In the current research, we address the issue
              | of whether all individuals are equally inclined
              | to loaf in collective work, or whether there is a
              | way to differentiate systematically team workers
              | from team loafers. After all, when team work is
              | so important, a way to identify those who still
              | exert effort in groups would seem important
              | for all concerned. Before we turn to the speciﬁc
              | question of what motivates people to contribute
              | to a group product, we will brieﬂy summarize the
              | social psychological explanations for reduced
              | group productivity.
              | Motivation losses in group work
              | Since the discovery and analysis of the Ringelmann
              | effect (see Ingham, Levinger, Graves, & Peckham,
              | 1974; Kravitz & Martin, 1986; Moede, 1927),
              | we know that group work compared to indi-
              | vidual work often results in productivity losses.
              | Latane et al. (1979) showed that the decreased
              | productivity is caused both by coordination
              | loss and by effort reduction. They interpreted
              | the effort reduction as a result of motivation
              | losses and called it ‘social loaﬁng’. With emerg-
              | ing research the phenomenon of motivation
              | losses in groups has been given different labels
              | depending on the circumstantial conditions.
              | Social loaﬁng stems from the realization that
              | the individual contribution cannot be iden-
              | tiﬁed and thus evaluated (Harkins & Jackson,
              | 1985). The potential for evaluation can come
              | from other group members, external sources (e.g.
              | the experimenter), or from the possibility for
              | self-evaluation, and any of these can eliminate the
              | effect (Harkins & Szymanski, 1989; Szymanski &
              | Harkins, 1987). Free-riding stems from the
              | perception that the individual’s contribution is
              | dispensable, even if it is identiﬁable and apprais-
              | able (Kerr & Brunn, 1983; for a detailed analysis
              | of task type and possible motivation losses in
              | the framework of social dilemmas, see also
              | Arnscheid, Diehl & Stroebe, 1997). The sucker-
              | effect results from the perception that others
              | are free-riding on one’s contributions or efforts
              | (Orbell & Dawes, 1981). In this case it is the
              | Abele and Diehl the protestant work ethic and group performance
              | potential of the averseness of this role, which
              | makes the individual reduce his/her effort.
              | Kerr (1983) argues that the violation of certain
              | social norms like the equity norm, the norm of
              | reciprocity and the norm of social responsibil-
              | ity make the sucker role uncomfortable. In the
              | last decade motivation losses in group perform-
              | ance have been linked to general theories of
              | motivation (Karau & Williams, 1993; Shepperd,
              | 1993; Shepperd & Taylor, 1999).
              | The proposed underlying mechanism for the
              | free-rider effect and social loaﬁng are based on
              | the assumption that individuals’ main driving
              | force is to maximize individual outcomes while
              | minimizing input. The proposed underlying
              | mechanism for the sucker-effect is, in a sense,
              | distinct from the other two, as it is based on the
              | assumption that behavior can also be driven by
              | other motives and needs like feeling socially
              | equal and accepted. An obvious question is
              | whether other motives, as for instance seeing
              | work as something valuable per se, may play
              | important roles in group work also.
              | What moderates motivation losses in
              | group work
              | Karau and Williams’ (1993) meta-analytic re-
              | view concludes that motivation losses in group
              | work is a robust phenomenon which generalizes
              | across tasks and populations. Above we have
              | brieﬂy mentioned variables that play a role in
              | the underlying processes of motivation losses
              | in groups. Among those, evaluation potential,
              | expectations of coworker performance, task
              | meaningfulness and culture were found to have
              | a consistent impact (Karau & Williams, 1993).
              | Moreover, individual differences have also
              | been shown to moderate motivation losses in
              | groups. Need for cognition refers to the tend-
              | ency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive
              | endeavors (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982). Smith, Kerr,
              | Markus, and Stasson (2001) demonstrated that
              | the need for cognition can moderate motivation
              | losses in group work: individuals high in need
              | for cognition worked equally hard on a vigilance
              | task, regardless of whether they were working
              | collectively or coactively. Individuals low in need
              | for cognition, however, exerted considerably less
              | effort when working collectively compared to
              | working coactively.
              | Hart, Karau, Stasson, and Kerr (2004) showed
              | that people high in achievement motivation
              | exerted equal effort whether they were work-
              | ing coactively or collectively and whether they
              | expected the other person to exert high or low
              | effort. However, people low in achievement
              | motivation reduced their effort most when
              | working collectively with somebody from whom
              | they expected high effort. Hence, apparently they
              | reduced their effort when they perceived their
              | contribution as dispensable and not identiﬁable.
              | However, what is not clear in their study is how
              | participants interpreted the allegedly predicted
              | effort of their team member. When induced to
              | expect low effort, participants received the mes-
              | sage that their team partner found the task
              | very interesting but was not going to exert
              | much effort on it. This message is ambiguous.
              | Participants could have attributed the reduced
              | effort of their partner to their lack of willingness
              | or of capability. Neither of these attributions is
              | compelling. On the one hand, why would some-
              | body reduce effort on a task that she/he ﬁnds
              | interesting? On the other hand, why would lack
              | of ability lead to a reduction of effort? More-
              | over, the source of attribution for the reduced
              | effort plays an important role in social loaﬁng.
              | Reduced input from a team member due to
              | lack of ability evokes quite different reactions
              | than reduced effort due to a lack of willingness
              | (Kerr, 1983).
              | As noted above, previous research has shown
              | that need for cognition and achievement motiv-
              | ation moderate reduction of effort in collective
              | work. However, effects of these moderators would
              | not differ depending on whether a partner’s
              | reduced effort stemmed from unwillingness
              | or inability. People high in need for cognition
              | or achievement motivation would sustain their
              | effort regardless of the reason for the partner’s
              | reduced effort. In these cases, the enjoyment of
              | the task (need for cognition) or the desire to
              | achieve are not dampened by a partner’s lack of
              | motivation or ability. However, beliefs regarding
              | the value of work and the importance of equity
              | should moderate one’s reactions to a partner
              | and her/his reasons for reducing effort.

              | The Protestant Work Ethic
              | In 1905 Max Weber published ‘The Protestant
              | ethic and the spirit of capitalism’. The basic idea
              | was that the Protestant ethic was an important
              | factor in the economic success of Protestant
              | groups in the early stages of capitalism. Worldly
              | success was interpreted as a sign of righteousness
              | and therefore vigorously pursued. Since Weber,
              | anthropologists, economists, sociologists, his-
              | torians and psychologists have been interested
              | in the issue of the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE).
              | Psychologists were not concerned with whether
              | Weber was right or wrong but translated the con-
              | cept into an individual difference construct.
              | McClelland (1961) was the ﬁrst to use the con-
              | cept of PWE within psychology. His explanation
              | for the association between Protestantism
              | and capitalism was the following. Parents, who
              | have internalized Protestant values, reared their
              | children in ways that foster independence,
              | rationality and delay of gratiﬁcation. Instilling
              | these values produces children with a high
              | achievement motivation, and people with a
              | high achievement motivation are very likely
              | to contribute to the expansion of business. He
              | subsumed the concept of PWE under need for
              | achievement. Placing PWE in this conceptual
              | context has been criticized because it emphasizes
              | only the ‘hard work-aspect’ of the work ethic and
              | leaves out other aspects. Nonetheless, the idea
              | that high achievement motivation is a relatively
              | stable disposition which has its roots in early
              | socialization led others to construe PWE be-
              | liefs as an individual difference of conceptual
              | interest. The research focus shifted from the
              | etiology of the PWE to the measurement of the
              | construct and to its relationships to behavior
              | patterns and other belief systems. Several self-
              | report measures were developed (e.g. Blood,
              | 1969; Buchholz, 1976; Goldstein & Eichhorn,
              | 1961; Hammond & Williams, 1976; Ho, 1984;
              | Mirels & Garrett, 1971; Ray, 1982). Using these
              | measures, PWE has been shown to correlate with
              | behaviors and other constructs. Persons with
              | a high PWE are industrious, ambitious, hard
              | working and intrinsically motivated (Furnham,
              | 1990a), stemming from the attitude that work
              | will and should pay off. They tend to have an
meta          | 42
text          | internal locus of control in matters that are
              | linked to work (Lied & Pritchard, 1976) and
              | are not easily affected by external factors. Their
              | behavioral orientation in a free-choice period is
              | to work equally hard on the task regardless of the
              | performance feedback (Furnham, 1990a). More-
              | over, they are inclined to apply an equity norm,
              | as opposed to an equality norm, in deciding how
              | to distribute a resource (Greenberg, 1978).
              | Equity norm refers to a proportional input–
              | output relation. People perceive a distribution
              | as fair when their own ratio of inputs to outputs
              | equals the input–output ratio of others. Put
              | differently, according to equity norm, rewards
              | should be distributed in direct proportion to
              | the effort each group member exerts (Adams,
              | 1965; Walster, Berscheid & Walster, 1973).
              | In contrast to that, the equality norm does not
              | focus on the input–output relation in deter-
              | mining whether justice or injustice is perceived,
              | but merely on an equal size of the output. Hence,
              | the equality norm would suggest an equal
              | distribution of rewards irrespective of inputs
              | (Homans, 1958, 1961).

              | the PWE as a moderator of motivation losses in
              | group work. Heaven (1989) as well as Furnham
              | (1990b) delivered empirical evidence that
              | the global construct ‘PWE’ consists of several
              | components. Thus different components might
              | be responsible for the behavioral correlates and
              | associations with other personality constructs
              | and attitudes, which were described above. For
              | example, a high work ethic is associated with a
              | preference for the equity norm and the belief
              | in the instrumental value of work (‘work should
              | and does pay off’) and the belief in the ethical
              | value of work (‘it is ethical to be occupied with
              | work’); whereas people with a low work ethic are
              | extrinsically motivated and prefer the equality
              | norm when asked to divide a reward, and do not
              | believe in the ethical value of work (Furnham,
              | 1990a; Greenberg, 1978). The implication is

              | that PWE is a global construct that includes should, as in the free-rider case, make one less

              | instrumental value of work, a belief in the less concerned with the possibility that others
              | ethical value of work and a preference for equity are free riding. The implications of the ethical

              | reactions one has to others’ efforts in collective to work hard—that is, to behave in an unethical
              | work. The free-riding effect occurs, when indi- manner. When framed this way, continuing to
              | viduals realize that their contribution to the work hard in the face of others’ ‘laziness’ rewards

              | exhibit the sucker effect. However, if they focus
              | on the implications for the ethics (and perhaps
              | deservingness) of others, then they should avoid

              | Method
              | Overview
              | In order to test the research hypotheses, a situ-
              | ation was designed that permitted free-riding,
              | and another situation was designed that made
              | participants vulnerable to the sucker-effect.
              | Also included were two corresponding control
              | conditions. Participants worked in dyads on a
              | potentially divisible task.
              | In the free-rider condition, participants were
              | led to believe that their partner was capable of
              | the task by the initial feedback on the task perfor-
              | mance. In the free-rider control condition,
              | participants performed the task individually.
              | In the sucker effect condition, hereafter referred
              | to as the sucker condition, the partner of the par-
              | ticipant is portrayed as capable by the initial
              | feedback on task performance. The feedback
              | after the ﬁrst three trials revealed that the team
              | did quite well on the task, but that the par-
              | ticipant’s contribution consistently exceeded the
              | ‘partner’s’ contribution. The ‘partner’ of the par-
              | ticipant was a confederate of the experimenter. In
              | order to have the participants really attribute the
              | ‘partner’s’ smaller contribution to his reduced
              | effort and not to lower ability, the confederate
              | displayed boredom by scripted behavior. In
              | the sucker effect control condition, hereafter
              | referred to as the sucker control condition, the
              | participant’s contribution exceeded the ‘part-
              | ner’s’ contribution. But here the participant was
              | led to believe by the initial task performance
              | feedback that their partner’s task ability was
              | low. During the initial trials, the confederate
              | commented on the difﬁculty of the task.
              | Participants and design
              | Eighty male students from University Col-
              | lege London participated in the experiment.
              | Because of the sex difference in the sucker-
              | effect (Kerr, 1983) only males were included.
meta          | 44
text          | Participants were randomly assigned to one
              | of the four experimental conditions (free-rider,
              | free-rider control, sucker or sucker control).
              | Thus, the design was a four independent group
              | design.
              | Measurement of PWE
              | The endorsement of the PWE was assessed with
              | the Protestant Work Ethic Scale from Mirels &
              | Garrett (1971) and the Australian Work Ethic
              | Scale from Ho (1984). Despite the theoretical
              | inclusion of the equity/equality norm in the
              | concept of PWE as a variable of individual dif-
              | ferences, these scales do not include items that
              | measure directly a preference for equity or
              | equality. Therefore, nine additional items were
              | created to assess the degree to which participants
              | endorse the equity norm. Examples of such
              | items are: ‘The trouble with giving people equal
              | rewards for work is that they very rarely work
              | equally hard’ or ‘When a task is completed by a
              | team there is nothing wrong with distributing the
              | reward equally regardless of unequal input’.
              | Task
              | The task that the participants performed in
              | three trials was the ‘d2’ concentration test
              | (Brickenkamp, 1994). In this test, participants
              | are confronted with a sheet full of the letters
              | ‘d’ and ‘p’ which have one to four lines above
              | or beneath them. The task is to work through
              | the lines of letters and cross out every ‘d’ that
              | has two lines with it. To provide a rationale for
              | participants to complete this task in teams and
              | to deﬂect their attention from our interest in
              | individual performance in collective endeavors,
              | the following cover story was presented:
              | This study is about how to design the task of manually
              | checking transfer slips most efﬁciently. In most
              | instances one ﬁlls in forms nowadays using the com-
              | puter. However, some service providers, like banks,
              | are still obliged to offer other possibilities for clients
              | to hand in forms. Service providers let clients also
              | use forms, which can be ﬁlled in by hand, but can
              | later be read by a computer. People are instructed
              | how to ﬁll in these forms, so that the computer can
              | read them, but still a given percentage cannot be
              | read by the computers. When the computers read
              | the forms, the information is translated into a code.
              | This code then appears on a screen, and consists
              | Abele and Diehl the protestant work ethic and group performance
              | of signs and abnormalities. The signs represent
              | information from the transfer slip that could be
              | read properly, whereas the abnormalities stem
              | from information that could not be read properly.
              | Somebody has to detect the abnormalities, which
              | demands a continuously high concentration and is
              | a boring task. A short period of inattention will lead
              | to a greater amount of undetected abnormalities,
              | which will be noticed in the succeeding processing.
              | The study tests whether sharing the task so that the
              | code would come up on two screens has an im-
              | pact. Another feature that the study addresses is
              | whether and how much feedback and feedback
              | frequencies have an impact on performance. Hence,
              | participants will be working on a task, where they
              | have to detect abnormal signs in a list of abnormal
              | and normal signs (they were doing this either with
              | another person or alone) and will be given feedback
              | in regular frequencies.
              | Procedure
              | After arrival participants were asked to com-
              | plete the PWE questionnaires, which were said
              | to be part of a different research project. They
              | were then told the alleged purpose of the study
              | before they were randomly assigned to one of
              | the four conditions. With the exception of
              | the free-rider control condition, participants
              | were told that they would work at the task as a
              | cooperative team and that their performances
              | would be summed and they would be rewarded
              | for their combined performance regardless
              | of their individual contributions. Participants
              | were guaranteed £2 as a reward and they were
              | told that they could earn up to £3 depending
              | on their combined performance. £3 was worth
              | approximately US$5. Eventually everybody was
              | paid £3. Participants were then made familiar
              | with the requirements of the task by practicing on
              | a line of letters. During the actual experimental
              | trials participants were wearing headphones.
              | The command to start was given via these head-
              | phones. Furthermore, during the trials there
              | was ofﬁce noise in the room in order to prevent
              | the participants from overhearing each other’s
              | speed.
              | The ﬁrst trial lasted for one minute and par-
              | ticipants were told that this trial was meant to
              | assess their initial ability. The second to the
              | fourth trials lasted for two and a half minutes
              | each. The experimenter left the room while the
              | ‘teams’ were actually working on the task. Be-
              | havior in the room could be monitored through
              | a glass window in the door. After each trial the
              | experimenter returned, took the sheets from
              | the participants and allegedly scored them in
              | the same room.
              | Participants were told that their feedback
              | would compare their performance to the aver-
              | age performance by other participants. In all
              | experimental conditions participants were given
              | the feedback after the ﬁrst trial in which their
              | own performance, which was supposedly the
              | initial ability, was 20% above average. In the sucker
              | condition and the free-rider condition they were told
              | that their partner’s performance was 20% above
              | average as well, whereas in the control condition
              | to the sucker-effect the performance feedback for
              | the partner was 5% below average.
              | After the ﬁrst trial in the sucker condition, the
              | confederate yawned and stretched and started
              | to lean back with his chair while the sheets were
              | corrected. After the second trial he again leaned
              | backwards and began to drum with his ﬁngers
              | on the table. The performance feedback then
              | revealed a combined result around 20% above
              | average and a contribution of the participant to
              | the total of about 60%. After the third trial the
              | confederate mumbled to himself ‘it’s getting
              | boring’, while the experimenter was still outside
              | the room. The performance feedback for this
              | trial then again revealed a combined result that
              | was 20% above average, to which the participant
              | had again contributed more than 60%.
              | In the sucker control condition the confederate
              | said after the ﬁrst trial, ‘I can’t tell them apart’.
              | After the second trial he moaned and said to
              | himself ‘it is really difﬁcult’. The combined re-
              | sult was said to be 20% above average and the
              | contribution of the participant about 60%. After
              | the third trial the confederate said ‘not easy’
              | while handing his sheet over to the experimenter.
              | Feedback for this trial then revealed the same
              | result as for the second trial.
              | In the free-rider condition participants were
              | told after the second and third trials that they
              | together achieved 20% above average; no infor-
              | mation was given concerning the individual
meta          | 45

              | contributions to the team performance. In the
              | free-rider control condition participants were given
              | the feedback that they achieved about 20% above
              | average after each trial.
              | Feedback was never provided after the fourth
              | trial in any of the four experimental conditions.
              | After the fourth trial, participants were asked
              | to complete a questionnaire that functioned as
              | a manipulation check. Participants were then
              | debriefed, thanked and paid.
              | Results
              | The PWE
              | In order to disentangle the components of the
              | global construct a principal component factor
              | analysis with varimax rotation was conducted
              | using all of the items from the questionnaires.
              | A scree plot indicated the presence of three fac-
              | tors. These three factors accounted for 38.6%
              | of the variance. The ﬁrst factor accounted for
              | 13.23% of the variance. Items loading high on
              | this factor portray the attitude that work has a
              | moral value. It was therefore called the Ethical
              | Factor. The second factor explained 12.9% of
              | the variance. Items loading high on this factor
              | capture the notion that work should and will
              | pay off. It was therefore called the Instrumental
              | Factor. The third factor explained 12.5% of
              | the variance, and items loading high on this
              | factor measure the attitude to the equity prin-
              | ciple. This factor was called the Equity Factor.
              | Examples for items loading high on the re-
              | spective factors can be found in the Appendix.
              | Factor scores were computed to be used later
              | as a measure of individual differences on the
              | three dimensions.
              | Analysis of the performance data
              | Four participants had to be excluded from the
              | analysis; one had suspicions about the con-
              | federate and the other three did not complete
              | the task properly. Table 1 reveals the mean
              | raw performance scores in all four conditions
              | for the four trials. Raw performances are the

              | that should have been marked prior to the last
              | correctly marked sign).
              | The primary dependent variable was perform-
              | ance on the fourth trial. As depicted in Table 1,
              | scores in the fourth trial in the free-rider
              | condition (M = 282.26) and in the sucker con-
              | dition (M = 279.47) were lower than in the
              | free-rider control condition (M = 316.8) and in
              | the control condition sucker-effect (M = 295.8).
              | A one-way analysis of covariance was performed,
              | with the performance in the fourth trial as a
              | dependent variable, and the performance on
              | the ﬁrst trial as a covariate. The ﬁrst trial was
              | used as a covariate in order to control for indi-
              | vidual differences in performance before the
              | introduction of the experimental manipulations
              | and hence reduce error variance. There was
              | a main effect of the condition (F(3, 71) = 3.2,
              | p < .028). Also the effect of the covariate was
              | signiﬁcant (F(1, 71) = 58,7, p < .001). Table 2
              | contains the mean performances adjusted for
              | the covariate.
              | Two contrasts were calculated to test for the
              | free-rider effect and the sucker-effect, respect-
              | ively. The comparison for the free-rider to the
              | free-rider control was signiﬁcant (F(1, 67) = 5.67,

              | Sucker and free-rider effects and PWE
              | A regression analysis was conducted using only
              | participants from the sucker control condition
              | and the sucker effect condition. The regression
              | model used performance on the fourth trial as
              | the dependent variable and trial 1 performance,
              | sucker effect conditions and scores on the
              | original PWE scale as predictors. Also included
              | was an interaction term of condition by PWE
              | score. All predictors were centered before the re-
              | gression was conducted. The effect of the trial 1
              | performance and sucker condition were signiﬁ-
              | cant, conﬁrming the results from the foregoing
              | covariance analysis. The interaction of sucker
              | condition by score on PWE scale was only mar-
              | ginally signiﬁcant (t(32) = 1.58, p > .12). Thus
              | the sucker effect was marginally moderated by
              | people’s score on the global PWE scale.
              | A regression analysis was conducted using only
              | participants from the free-rider condition and
              | the free-rider control condition. The regression
              | model used performance on the fourth trial as
              | the dependent variable and trial 1 performance,
              | free-rider effect conditions and scores on the
              | original PWE scale as predictors. Also included
              | was an interaction term of condition by PWE
              | score. All predictors were centered before
              | the regression was conducted. The effect of the
              | trial 1 performance and free rider conditions
              | were signiﬁcant, conﬁrming the results from the
              | covariance analysis. The interactions with the
              | PWE score was not signiﬁcant (t(34) < 1, ns).
              | Sucker-effect and PWE factors
              | For each of the PWE factors, a regression an-
              | alysis was conducted using only participants
              | from the sucker control condition and the
              | sucker-effect condition. The regression model
              | used performance on the fourth trial as the
              | dependent variable and trial 1 performance,
              | sucker-effect conditions and factor scores as
              | predictors. Also included was an interaction
              | term of condition by respective factor score.
              | All predictors were centered before conducting
              | the regression. In all the regressions the effect
              | of the trial 1 performance and sucker condition
              | were signiﬁcant, conﬁrming the results from the
              | covariance analysis. The interaction of sucker
              | condition by factor score was signiﬁcant for all
              | components: instrumental factors (t(36) = 2.01,
              | p > .05), ethical factor (t(36) = 2.19, p < .036) and
              | equity factor (t(36) = 2.06, p < .048). Thus the
              | sucker-effect was different for people who scored
              | high and low on all of the PWE factors.
              | To better understand the nature of the
              | interactions of PWE factors and the sucker-
              | effect, estimated means for people scoring one
              | standard deviation above and one standard
              | deviation below the mean on each factor were
              | obtained using the regression model. These
              | estimated means are plotted for participants
              | in the experimental sucker and sucker control
              | conditions in Figures 1 to 3.
              | Participants, who endorsed the idea that work
              | should and will pay off, worked almost as hard
              | in the sucker control condition (M = 285.09) as
              | they did in the sucker experimental condition
              | (M = 281.69). But participants who did not see
              | work as something that should and will pay
              | off worked harder when working with some-
              | body who was contributing less because of
              | ability (M = 306.44), than when working with
              | someone who contributed less due to lack of
              | effort (M = 272.05). Thus, people endorsing the
              | instrumental value of work were not affected by
              | being the sucker. They seemed to focus more on
              | their part of the work even if the other was not
              | working hard. People who believed less in the
              | long-range instrumental value of work worked
              | harder when their partner was incapable than
              | when he was unwilling to exert effort.

              | Endorsement of the ethical value of work
              | and of equity produced similar patterns in
              | the sucker conditions. When their partner was
              | incapable, participants who endorsed the ethical
              | value of work (M = 306.84) and who endorsed
              | the equity principle (M = 310.32) worked
              | harder than those who did not subscribe to the
              | ethical value of work (M = 263.18) and to the
              | principle of equity (M = 271.4). In contrast,

              | value of work and participants who subscribed
              | to the equality principle exerted about the same
              | effort regardless of whether their partner was
              | performing poorly due to inability or due to

              | lack of trying. So apparently belief in the ethical
              | value of work and adherence to the equity
              | principle led participants to compensate for an
              | incapable partner but to avoid being a sucker.
              | Free-rider effect and PWE factors
              | For each of the PWE factors, a regression an-
              | alysis was conducted using only participants
              | from the free rider condition and the free
              | rider control condition. The regression model
              | used performance on the fourth trial as the
              | dependent variable and trial 1 performance,
              | free rider effect conditions and scale score as
              | predictors. Also included was an interaction term
              | of condition by scale score. All predictors were
              | centered before the regression was conducted.
              | In all the regressions the effect of the trial 1
              | performance and free rider conditions were
              | signiﬁcant, conﬁrming the results from the
              | covariance analysis. The predicted interaction of
              | free-rider condition by instrumental scale score
              | was only marginally signiﬁcant (t(38) = 1.49
              | p < .07, one-tailed). The interactions with the
              | equity and ethical scale were not signiﬁcant.
              | Thus the free-rider effect was marginally dif-
              | ferent only for people who scored high and low
              | on the instrumental component of PWE. The
              | estimated means for people scoring one standard
              | deviation above and one standard deviation
              | below the mean on the instrumental factor were
              | obtained using the regression model. These

              | Participants who believed in the instrumental

              | ance in the free rider control condition
              | (M = 312.82) and the free-rider experimental
              | condition (M = 307.36). But participants who
              | did not believe in the instrumental value of work
              | were affected by the situational circumstances in
              | their effort exertion. When working alone, they
              | worked harder (M = 309.66) than when working
              | as a team (M = 262.52) with an allegedly skilled
              | person and individual contributions were not
              | identiﬁable.
              | Discussion
              | The purpose of this study was to investigate the
              | moderating effects of attitudes toward work, as
              | embodied in the global construct of the PWE,
              | on motivation losses in performance groups. We
              | distinguished two types of motivation loss which
              | we suggest involve distinctly different psycho-
              | logical processes. More speciﬁcally, the sucker-
              | effect is a reaction to reduced effort by others
              | in collective work and, as the name implies, to
              | the potential of one’s own effort being exploited
              | by others. The free-rider effect is the robust
              | tendency to reduce effort in collective work when
              | individual contributions are not identiﬁable.
              | Our experimental setup induced both sucker-
              | and free-rider effects. When participants were
              | working with another individual and their
              | individual contributions were combined and un-
              | identiﬁable, they produced less than when they
              | thought they were working alone—the classic
              | free-rider effect. When they were working with
              | another person whose output was relatively low,
              | they produced less when they thought the other
              | person was not trying than when they thought
              | the other person was not capable—the classic
              | sucker-effect.
              | Our purpose was to examine whether com-
              | ponents of PWE moderate the inclinations
              | to reduce effort in the free-riding and sucker
              | conditions. Based on past work with PWE (e.g.
              | Furnham,1990b; Heaven, 1989), we anticipated
              | that the global construct was a combination
              | of at least three components: belief that work
              | will be rewarded (instrumental component),
              | belief that hard work is a marker of righteousness
              | (ethical component) and belief that people
              | ought to be rewarded equitably for their work
              | (equity component). We constructed the gobal
              | measure of PWE from items taken from Mirels
              | and Garrett (1971) and Ho and Lloyd (1984) and
              | added additional items designed to measure
              | more preferences for equity in the distribution of
              | resources. We factor analyzed responses to items
              | from this global measure and obtained distinct
              | factors that corresponded to the anticipated
              | components of belief in the ethical value of work,
              | the instrumental value of work and the equity
              | principle.
              | Even though they are distinct, conceptually and
              | empirically, the factors are strongly correlated
              | with the traditional measures of PWE. For
              | example the instrumental factor correlated
              | .85 with the Ho and Lloyd’s (1984) PWE scale
              | and .48 with the PWE scale used by Mirels and
              | Garrett (1971). The ethical factor also correlated
              | strongly with the Mirels and Garrett scale (r = .74)
              | but modestly with the Ho and Lloyd measure
              | (r = .27). The equity factor, not surprisingly given
              | that it consisted largely of items not contained in
              | these traditional measures, correlated modestly
              | both with the Mirels and Garrett scale (r = .38)
              | and with the Ho and Lloyd scale (r = .27).
              | We expected that these components of PWE
              | would moderate free-riding and sucker- effects
              | in different ways. Concerning the sucker-effect
meta          | 49
text          | Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 11(1)
              | and a potential moderating role of the PWE,
              | we had two contrasting hypotheses. On the one
              | hand, we speculated that people high in the
              | instrumental value component of PWE would
              | not show the sucker-effect because of their belief
              | that hard work pays off in the long run. On the
              | other hand, people who subscribe strongly to
              | an equity norm should show the sucker-effect
              | in that they would react to the violation of the
              | equity norm in a situation where a partner is, by
              | choice, coasting. Thus, we did not expect that
              | the global measure of PWE would moderate the
              | sucker-effect and it did not.
              | Our expectation regarding the moderating
              | inﬂuence of the instrumental component on the
              | sucker-effect was conﬁrmed. Participants who
              | believed in the long-range instrumental value of
              | work were not affected by the reasons for their
              | partner’s low output. Whether he contributed
              | less than the participant due to lack of ability
              | or to lack of motivation did not seem to matter
              | to them. In contrast, participants who did not
              | endorse the instrumental value of work exerted
              | more effort when their partner was incapable
              | rather than lazy. Somewhat surprisingly, these
              | participants who were low on the instrumental
              | component actually worked harder when
              | paired with an incapable partner than did the
              | participants who were high on the instrumental
              | component. Thus, it seems that people who
              | do not subscribe to the instrumental value of
              | work are willing to compensate for a capability
              | deﬁcit, perhaps in order to gain the immedi-
              | ate incentives for high production. That is, for
              | them, work may not lead invariably to rewards
              | or be rewarding in itself but, when beneﬁts are
              | directly tied to collective production, they will
              | compensate for less capable coworkers.
              | As predicted, participants who endorsed the
              | equity principle were affected by the sucker
              | manipulations. If their partner provided the
              | impression that the participant could become
              | the sucker, those who reported a preference for
              | equity over equality reduced their effort con-
              | siderably. In comparison, when they thought
              | their team partner was less capable at the
              | task, they exerted extra effort to compensate
              | for their partner’s deﬁcits. Apparently it matters
              | for people endorsing the equity principle
meta          | 50
text          | why a coworker’s contributions are subpar. If
              | poor performance is due to a lack of ability, they
              | almost appear to act according to the principle
              | that input should be proportional to individual
              | resources or ability. If they do not have any
              | reason to believe that resources or abilities are
              | disproportionate, they are sensitive to the subpar
              | contributions of their partner and exert less
              | effort. People who are more likely to endorse
              | the equality norm do not seem to be affected
              | by the reason for their partner’s lesser input.
              | If it appears to be lack of motivation or skill,
              | it does not seem to affect them. They do not
              | endorse the equity norm, and consequently, it
              | seems that they do not experience any danger
              | of becoming a sucker in the light of a violation
              | of such a norm.
              | People who see hard work as an ethical marker
              | also react to the apparent reasons that a coworker
              | is performing poorly. Participants who believed
              | in the ethical value of work were affected by the
              | apparent cause of their partners’ inferior con-
              | tributions to the collective product. They, like
              | equity endorsers seemed willing to compensate
              | for lack of ability. However, they reduced their
              | input when the partner was loaﬁng. Thus, the
              | ethical value that people see in work is not simply
              | self-focused (i.e. ‘If I work hard, I am good’) but
              | also other-focused (i.e. ‘Lazy people are bad’).
              | In other words, people who believe in the ethical
              | value of work have a broader moral concern.
              | When they are working with somebody who does
              | not seem to spend much effort on the task, they
              | are not willing to compensate for the other’s
              | lack of effort and, in the spirit of defending
              | their moral claim, are prepared to forego
              | part of their reward. Hence defending their
              | moral claim seems more important than the
              | external reward. People who do not believe in
              | the ethical value of work, have less of a mission
              | to defend some ethical principle, and hence do
              | not appear to experience great psychological
              | costs if another person might free-ride on their
              | effort. Consequently they exerted the same
              | effort, no matter whether the other person was
              | incapable or not motivated.
              | Contrary to our predictions, the global PWE
              | measure did not moderate the free-rider effect.
              | Moreover, the free rider effect was only weakly
              | Abele and Diehl the protestant work ethic and group performance
              | related to the belief in the instrumental value
              | of work. The trends suggest that people who
              | believe in the notion that work should and will
              | pay off did not take advantage of the possibil-
              | ity to free-ride on somebody else’s effort. They
              | worked equally hard when working alone and
              | when working with another when contribu-
              | tions were not identiﬁable. Participants who
              | believed to a lesser extent in the instrumental
              | value of work were affected by the social context.
              | When it needed their individual effort to get the
              | reward they worked much harder, compared to
              | the situation in which they could free-ride on
              | somebody else’s effort.
              | In sum, neither the sucker effect nor the free-
              | rider effect was moderated by the global con-
              | struct of PWE. However the sucker-effect seemed
              | to be moderated in different ways by the three
              | components of the PWE, namely the belief
              | in the ethical value of work, the belief in the
              | instrumental value of work and the endorsement
              | of the equity principle. The free-rider effect,
              | on the other hand, seems to be only marginally
              | moderated by the belief in the instrumental
              | value of work.
              | Sucker and free-rider effects seem to be quali-
              | tatively different motivation losses in group per-
              | formance. The sucker-effect is moderated by
              | beliefs about the instrumental and ethical value
              | of work and preferences for equity, whereas these
              | components tells us less about who is likely to
              | free-ride. One potentially contributing difference
              | between avoiding being the sucker and free-
              | riding is that avoiding the sucker role is a reaction
              | to the behavior, anticipated or actual, of another
              | person. In the experimental manipulation of the
              | sucker-effect, the other person is giving the im-
              | pression that he is lowering their input because
              | he does not feel like working hard. Consequently
              | the participant sees the danger that he might
              | be exploited, and the psychological cost of ex-
              | ploitation is higher than foregoing part of the
              | monetary reward for high productivity. But
              | these psychological costs are not experienced
              | by everybody alike. More speciﬁcally, it is subject
              | to individual differences that are bundled in the
              | PWE construct. A high belief in the instrumental
              | value of work makes you immune to the sucker-
              | effect. Thus, instrumental value seems to be
              | a more self-focused belief in the long-range
              | beneﬁts of working hard and thus less responsive
              | to the social context. A strong endorsement
              | of the equity principle makes one particularly
              | vulnerable to the sucker-effect. Seemingly, the
              | psychological costs of exploitation are perceived
              | as high by people who believe in equity, and
              | thus they avoid being the sucker. Interestingly
              | a strong belief in the ethical value of work also
              | makes one especially vulnerable to the sucker
              | effect, suggesting that the cost of compensating
              | for another’s laziness is too costly.
              | The free-rider effect does not seem to be
              | affected so strongly by the PWE components.
              | Although it appears that belief in the instrumental
              | value of work may reduce free-riding, this
              | evidence in our data is statistically weak. More-
              | over, we obtained no evidence that the ethical
              | value and equity preference moderate free-
              | riding. One possible reason is that people may
              | not be aware of the reduction of effort that we
              | label free-riding. If they are not aware that they
              | are working less hard in a collective effort, their
              | beliefs about the work and equity may not be
              | relevant. Moreover, it is clear that motivation
              | loss in a free-rider situation is less of an affective
              | reaction than in a sucker effect condition. From
              | a certain perspective, free-riding seems rational.
              | That is, reducing effort in team situations after
              | getting joint feedback that the team is doing
              | well could be an adaptive approach to collective
              | endeavors. In the long run, it is functional to
              | save one’s resources when they are apparently
              | not needed for future endeavors when they
              | may be needed. This strategy does not neces-
              | sarily contradict the ethical value of work.
              | In conclusion, we examined individual dif-
              | ferences in free-riding and sucker-effects in
              | collective work. People who believe in equity and
              | the ethical value of work are particularly sensitive
              | to being the sucker and, thus, reduce their own
              | effort rather than compensate for the laziness
              | of a coworker. By comparison, people who be-
              | lieve that work should and will be rewarded in
              | the long-run do not seem to react to being the
              | sucker. There is also a tendency for these people
              | who believe in the instrumental value of work
              | to be less likely to free-ride. One implication is
              | that belief in the instrumental value of work is
meta          | 51
text          | Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 11(1)
              | a guide for one’s own behavior: ‘If I work hard,
              | I will be rewarded’. In contrast, both the ethical
              | component of PWE and the equity norm are
              | prescriptions not only about how one should
              | act but also how one should react to others’
              | expenditures of effort in collective work.

              | Appendix
              | Items with high loadings on the ﬁrst factor (Ethical
              | Factor):
              | 1. Most people spend too much time in unproﬁtable
              | amusement (Mirels & Garrett, 1971)
              | 2. Our society would have fewer problems if people
              | had less leisure time (Mirels & Garrett, 1971)
              | 3. Most people who don’t succeed in life are just
              | plain lazy (Mirels & Garrett, 1971)
              | 4. A self-made person is likely to be more ethical
              | than a person born to wealth (Mirels & Garrett,
              | 1971)
              | 5. People should have more leisure time to spend in
              | relaxation (r)1 (Mirels & Garrett, 1971)

              | 6. Life would be more meaningful if we had more
              | leisure time (r) (Mirels & Garrett, 1971)
              | Items with high loadings on the second factor
              | (Instrumental Factor):
              | 1. Hard work is not a key to success (r) (Ho, 1984)
              | 2. People who work deserve success (Ho, 1984)
              | 3. There are few satisfactions equal to the realization
              | that one has done one’s best at a job (Mirels &
              | Garrett, 1971)
              | 4. By working hard an individual can overcome most
              | obstacles that life presents and make his or her
              | own way in the world (Ho, 1984)
              | 5. Nothing is impossible if you work hard enough
              | (Ho, 1984)
              | 6. If you work hard you will succeed (Ho, 1984)
              | 7. The person who can approach an unpleasant
              | task with enthusiasm is the one who gets ahead
              | (Mirels & Garrett, 1971)
              | 8. Hard work is fulﬁlling in itself (Ho, 1984)
              | 9. You should be best at what you do (Ho, 1984)
              | Items with high loadings on the third factor (Equity
              | Factor):
              | 1. When a task is completed by a team there is
              | nothing wrong with distributing the reward equally
              | regardless of unequal input (r)
              | 2. The relative input of each team-member does not
              | necessarily provide a legitimate basis for claiming
              | differential rewards (r)
              | 3. Rewards should be distributed to persons in direct
              | proportion to their inputs (i.e. their relative
              | contributions)
              | 4. The trouble with giving people equal rewards for
              | work is that they very rarely work equally hard
              | 5. If people work together on a task it is very important
              | that the reward is distributed in proportion to the
              | effort each puts in
              | 1 (r) means that the scoring of the item is reversed.
