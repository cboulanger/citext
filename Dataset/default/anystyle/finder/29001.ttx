              | conceptualize learning with technology and Actor-Network theory to understand the relationships

              | observation, this investigation maps the patterns of relations among humans and materials as
              | classroom socio-technical networks adapt to the inclusion of a handheld digital technology. The
              | results present a variety of ways that the human and material actors in classroom socio-technical
              | networks operate as an interconnected whole rather than as a set of individual interactions.

              | 1. Introduction
              | In the field of educational research, the dominant discourse is squarely focused
              | on the practices of humans such as teachers and students (SØRENSON, 2007).
              | This makes a great deal of sense since education is primarily concerned with
              | human learning. In some cases, however, this focus on human practices may
              | mask the roles that materials play and furthermore limit the richness of
              | understanding concerning learning situations (SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2006). In
              | mathematics education, for example, some researchers have gone as far as to
              | suggest that the intrinsic characteristics of educational technologies cease to
              | mediate learning and become increasingly transparent as learners' incorporate
              | them in their mathematical activities (MEIRA, 1998). Such approaches privilege
              | the role of humans to the point of obscuring important aspects of the meditational
              | role that materials have in mathematics learning and any intrinsic educational
              | value they might have (SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2005, 2006). [1]

              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | In this paper, I focus on the role of materials in education by investigating the
              | inclusion of a handheld digital technology in mathematics classrooms. As a
              | particular technological case, I examine the development and use of the TI-
              | Nspire™1 graphing calculator from Texas Instruments (see Figure 1).
              | Figure 1: TI-Nspire CAS [2]
              | Part of the latest generation of graphing calculators to be created specifically for
              | educational use, devices like TI-Nspire have closed the gap between what might
              | be considered a calculator and what might be considered a computer (DRIJVERS
              | & WEIGAND, 2010; KAPUT & SCHORR, 2008). These new technologies use
              | advances in mobile computer processors and displays to offer a range of
              | software applications such as spreadsheet tools, dynamic geometry software and
              | computer algebra systems (CAS) on relatively inexpensive handheld devices
              | (DRIJVERS & WEIGAND, 2010). [3]
              | To investigate the role of TI-Nspire in mathematics classrooms, I draw on
              | educational research related to the use of educational technology in mathematics
              | learning but I also draw on the field of Science and Technology Studies and in
              | particular Actor-Network theory (CALLON, 1986; LAW, 2002; LAW & MOL, 2001;
              | LATOUR, 2007). Specifically, I use the theoretical tools of Actor-Network theory
              | (ANT) to understand the relationship between humans and materials without
              | overtly obscuring the role that materials play and without discounting their
              | potential intrinsic educational value. Taking the ANT concept that the social is
              | comprised of networks of both humans and non-humans, I map the formation of
              | socio-technical networks in two mathematics classrooms where TI-Nspire from
              | Texas Instruments is used. [4]
              | 2. Understanding the Role of Materials in Mathematics Classrooms
              | Within the mathematics education research community, several researchers
              | looking specifically at educational technology such as TI-Nspire have suggested
              | approaches to understanding the relationship between technology, teachers and
              | students that avoid masking its potential role (BORBA & VILLARREAL, 2006;
              | 1 TI-Nspire™ is a registered trademark of Texas Instruments Inc. To avoid repetition the
              | trademark symbol is omitted for the remainder of this document.

              | FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:
              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | HEGEDUS & MORENO-ARMELLA, 2010; SHAFFER & CLINTON 2006;
              | TROUCHE & DRIJVERS, 2010; VERILLON & RABARDEL, 1995). One
              | particularly prominent view is known as the instrumental approach (LAGRANGE,
              | 1999; TROUCHE & DRIJVERS, 2010; VERILLON & RABARDEL, 1995). From
              | this perspective, learner and technology are considered to have a reciprocal
              | relationship and the process by which a technology becomes useful is
              | conceptualized as a movement from tool to instrument as the learner develops
              | schemata associated with the mathematical task that he/she uses the technology
              | to complete. Research drawing on the instrumental approach focuses on the
              | ways in which teachers organize the technologies available to them in the
              | classroom for pedagogical purposes and the ways technologies become
              | meaningful in the context of mathematical activity (DRIJVERS, DOORMAN,
              | BOON, REED & GRAVEMEIJER, 2010; TROUCHE, 2004). While the
              | instrumental approach foregrounds the important relationship between learner
              | and technology, it reduces the role of the technology to that of a mere object
              | waiting to be made an instrument by learners. This understanding moves away
              | from the view that the intrinsic characteristics of a technology become transparent
              | as it is made useful in the context of human practice but still obscures much of
              | the intrinsic educational value that a material may potentially bring to an
              | interaction with a learner. [5]
              | In a bid to address the problem of obscuring the potential role and intrinsic value
              | of materials in investigations of mathematics learning, SHAFFER and CLINTON
              | (2005, 2006) have suggested another approach that draws on elements of ANT
              | to conceptualize the relationship between learners and materials. In particular,
              | SHAFFER and CLINTON (2006) take the ANT notion that when agents, whether
              | human or non-human, act within socio-technical networks the capacity to act is
              | not located in either party but instead emerges from their interaction (SUCHMAN,
              | 2007; LATOUR, 2007; LAW, 2002). Drawing on this notion, they assert that in
              | relation to computing technologies such as TI-Nspire an overt focus on the
              | human side of human-technology relationships may limit understanding of the
              | role technology plays in learning. They note that while "this may not be a problem
              | in a theoretic culture of static inscriptional systems. In a virtual culture based on
              | offloading of symbolic processing, however, using human action to analyse activity
              | obscures the active role tools play" (SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2006, p.289). [6]
              | While the use of ANT is relatively rare in educational research, Shaffer and
              | Clinton's approach shares a number of common features with a small group of
              | researchers drawing on ANT to investigate a wide range of educational topics
              | (ROTH, 2002; FENWICK & EDWARDS, 2010; GOUGH, 2004;
              | SAMARAWICKREMA & STACEY, 2007; SØRENSEN, 2007). A key common
              | theme in the approaches of these researchers is a focus on the materiality of
              | learning situations without assuming the agency or role of any actors whether
              | human or non-human before examining their local interactions. SØRENSEN
              | (2007) for example, examined physical and virtual materials in primary school
              | classrooms by considering the activity between humans and materials to be a
              | relational effect rather than focusing on the agency of any individual or group of
              | actors. Her analysis describes a situation where both space and time within the
              | © 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/
              | FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:
              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | classroom are emergent phenomena of the relationships between students,
              | teachers and materials (SØRENSEN, 2007). [7]
              | Beyond conceptualizing the relationships between humans and non-humans
              | without making a priori assumptions about the agency of any actor, another key
              | common feature in studies of learning and educational settings that draw on ANT
              | is the combination of theoretical perspectives. Since by design ANT is more a
              | loose set of ideas rather than a well-defined theory, many researchers choose to
              | simultaneously draw on other theories to inform their work. This reflects the
              | evolving nature of ANT as a perspective on networks of social activity (FENWICK
              | & EDWARDS, 2010). SAMARAWICKREMA and STACEY (2007), for example,
              | drew on ROGERS' (2003) theory of diffusion of innovations in combination with
              | ANT to investigate the adoption of web-based distance learning technologies by
              | university level instructors. Using ROGERS' theory to examine the individual
              | motivations and actions of the instructors and ANT to understand the networks of
              | humans and technology, they analyzed the cases of six Australian universities as
              | they adopted web-based learning technologies (SAMARAWICKREMA &
              | STACEY, 2007). Their finding that successful adoption of technology by
              | instructors had little to do with general comfort with digital technology and was
              | instead influenced by such factors as funding grants and faculty politics illustrates
              | the broad range of inquiries that ANT can be implicated in through careful
              | combination with other theory. [8]
              | SAMARAWICKREMA and STACEY's (2007) choice to work with a combination of
              | theoretical perspectives is common amongst educational researchers who draw
              | on ANT (FENWICK & EDWARDS, 2010). Returning to SHAFFER and
              | CLINTON's (2005, 2006) approach to conceptualizing the relationship between
              | humans and technology in learning situations, they also combine ANT with other
              | theory. In this case, SHAFFER and CLINTON draw on ANT together with activity
              | theory (COLE, 1998; ENGESTRÖM, 2001; LEON'TEV, 1978; NARDI, 1995;
              | ROTH & LEE, 2007; VYGOTSKY, 1986 [1934]). This approach addresses the
              | major criticism that ANT lacks tools for conceptualizing the internal properties of
              | agents within social networks (ENGESTRÖM, 2001). To address this limitation,
              | SHAFFER and CLINTON (2006) draw particularly on the activity theory notion
              | that all human action including cognition takes place within activity systems that
              | are mediated by tools, whether psychological or technical (LEONT'EV, 1978;
              | VYGOTSKY, 1986 [1934]). With this conceptualization, learning is considered to
              | be an integral aspect of all human activity that necessarily involves tools whether
              | or not technical tools such as educational technologies are involved (SÄLJÖ,
              | EKLUND & MÄKITALO, 2006). [9]
              | 3. Theoretical Perspective
              | As a theoretical perspective for this study, I follow SHAFFER and CLINTON's
              | (2006) approach by drawing on Actor-Network theory (ANT) in combination with
              | activity theory. Originating with the ideas of VYGOTSKY (1986 [1934]) and
              | LEONT'EV (1978), activity theory is a psychological approach that is particularly
              | concerned with the socially and culturally situated nature of cognition. As a

              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | sociocultural approach to understanding cognition, it, "takes as its point of
              | departure the mediated nature of human knowledge and action" (SÄLJÖ, 1999,
              | p.151). The theory contends that all human activity takes place within systems
              | that are mediated by cultural tools. These tools can be both internal or
              | psychological and external or technical yielding the notion that all learning
              | involves tools (SÄLJÖ et al., 2006; WERTSCH, 1991). From this sociocultural
              | perspective, tools are understood to mediate all human activity whether we notice
              | them or not and are recognized as the vehicles through which we make meaning
              | (WERTSCH, 1998). This conception of tools, including technologies such as TI-
              | Nspire, as the crucial vehicles with which we make meaning is an important part
              | of the way learning is conceptualized in this study as tool mediated activity. [10]
              | While both activity theory and ANT are concerned with the mediation of systems
              | of activity, activity theory refers to systems of human activity mediated by tools
              | whereas ANT speaks to networks of humans and non-humans all mediating each
              | other's activity. From an ANT perspective, the properties of technologies in
              | learning situations cannot be ignored or considered transparent since both they
              | and the humans that use them mediate each other (LATOUR, 2007; LAW, 2002;
              | SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2006). Instead, ANT focuses on the ways in which socio-
              | technical networks form as humans and non-humans interact and their practices
              | stabilize (LATOUR, 2007). These networks are composed of relations of network-
              | objects themselves enacted by nested networks of humans and non-humans
              | (LAW, 2002; LAW & MOL, 2001). In the case of this study, for example, TI-Nspire
              | is treated as both a material object and a network-object. As a network-object it is
              | an element of classroom socio-technical networks that is enacted through nested
              | networks that include its developers, the teachers and students who use it,
              | electronics, software, and mathematical knowledge. Network-objects such as TI-
              | Nspire become what LATOUR (1990) refers to as "immutable" as the networks
              | that form them become stable. While network-objects stabilize in the context of
              | patterns of relations, the networks themselves remain fluid (LATOUR, 1990). In
              | this fluid space, the relations between network-objects constantly adapt as new
              | elements emerge or existing elements reconfigure but throughout this fluidity,
              | there is by necessity continuity. Otherwise, networks cease to remain intact, "If
              | everything is taken apart at the same time the result is rupture, the loss of shape-
              | continuity, the loss of identity. The result is more likely to be the creation of an
              | alternative object" (LAW, 2002, p.99). In these cases, network-objects become
              | new entities such as a phonebook being repurposed as a doorstop or a bolt
              | dissolving into the car it holds together. Drawing on ANT conceptions of socio-
              | technical networks of humans and non-humans, and the activity theory
              | understanding of cognition as tool mediated activity, in this study I examine
              | classrooms using TI-Nspire. This examination is at a scale in which the
              | technology is viewed as a network-object while recognizing that it and other
              | implicated network-objects are themselves enacted through complex nested
              | networks. [11]

              | 4. Method
              | To develop an understanding of the ways TI-Nspire is used in classrooms, I
              | observed and interviewed two teachers who regularly include the technology as
              | part of their instructional practices. These teachers were chosen because they
              | are both fluent users of the technology who make extensive use of it in their
              | classrooms but have distinct teaching and technology use backgrounds. One
              | teacher is an experienced mathematics educator who has worked with graphing
              | calculators for more than ten years while, at the time of the study, the other
              | teacher was new to teaching mathematics but had a background in computer
              | programming and teaching technology. Choosing teachers with a high level of
              | technical literacy afforded me access to contexts where the technology was
              | embedded in many mathematics education practices but, by the same token,
              | such levels of technical fluency are likely not present in most classrooms and this
              | limits my view of the ways TI-Nspire is used. [12]
              | First, I conducted audio-recorded interviews using a semi-structured schedule
              | that focused on the teachers' use of TI-Nspire and their experiences with
              | technology in the classroom. I drew on the work of MISHLER (1986, 2004) and
              | WEISS (1995) to guide the interview process and strove for conversations that
              | were informal and flexible in nature. Following these initial interviews, I observed
              | a series of five sessions in a ninth grade class taught by each teacher. During the
              | five sessions in each class, I followed a complete teaching unit. In one class the
              | unit involved the teaching of the algebraic skills necessary to perform operations
              | such as simplification on binomial expressions. In the other class, the unit
              | focused on working with data to produce graphs and functions to model trends. I
              | chose to follow a complete teaching unit in each class so that I would have the
              | opportunity to observe both when TI-Nspire was used as well as when it wasn't. I
              | chose ninth grade classes because in this particular school, this was the grade
              | level at which students either purchased or were given a TI-Nspire handheld to
              | use rather than only having access to the technology during class time. This
              | situation offered me the interesting opportunity of observing students who were
              | relatively new to the technology and yet had unfettered access for developing
              | fluency with it. [13]
              | While observing the classes, I recorded the activity with a video camera from the
              | back corner of the classrooms. In general, I followed the teachers with the
              | camera since my intention for the classroom observations was to concentrate on
              | the ways they included TI-Nspire in their instructional practices and situated the
              | technology for their students. This focus on the teachers guided the majority of
              | the in-camera editing decisions made about where to focus recording but I also
              | made efforts to maintain a wide view as much as possible using panning and
              | zooming sparingly. As DERRY et al. suggest, while a certain amount of pan and
              | zoom may be needed to get a detailed view of activities of interest, "too much
              | selection at recording time may rule out later lines of analysis" (2010, p.48).
              | Drawing on this principle while concentrating my in-camera selection decisions on
              | the teacher, I constantly considered the balance between recording detailed
              | views of teacher activities such as writing on the board or interacting with an

              | individual student and maintaining an impression of the activity in the classroom
              | as a whole. Following each observed session, I invited the teachers to participate
              | in debriefing interviews to help unpack the events that took place and to gain
              | more insight into the decisions made about when and how TI-Nspire was used. [14]
              | Once interviews and observation had been completed, I transcribed and added
              | the interview recordings and the observational videos to the qualitative analysis
              | software package Transana that allows efficient organization and analysis of
              | multiple media sources (WOODS & FASSNACHT, 2009). Within Transana each
              | recording and transcript pair was synchronized so that sections identified in one
              | medium would automatically correspond with the same sections in the other (see
              | DEMPSTER & WOODS, 2011 for a detailed description of a similar process).
              | This freedom to move between recording and transcript while maintaining
              | synchronization afforded flexibility to the analytic process during which multiple
              | passes of each interview and video-recording were made. While I analyzed the
              | interviews and observational videos, I also examined artifacts such as digital
              | documents created by the teachers to load onto TI-Nspire and worksheets
              | collected from the observed classrooms. [15]
              | As an approach to the analysis of the collected multimodal data, I drew on
              | interaction analysis (JORDAN & HENDERSON, 1995). This approach shares
              | many of the same or similar theoretical assumptions that are to be found in this
              | study. In particular, the approach assumes "that knowledge and action are
              | fundamentally social in origin, organization, and use, and are situated in particular
              | social and material ecologies" (p.41). This basic assumption is shared by both
              | activity theory and ANT and forms a key element of the theoretical perspective of
              | this study. From this underlying assumption, interaction analysis suggests a
              | number of ways of working with, in particular, video recordings to analyze
              | ethnographic data. These methods include creating content logs that outline the
              | activity on a recording as soon as possible having recorded an observational
              | session and conducting collaborative viewings with other researchers (JORDAN
              | & HENDERSON, 1995). Drawing on these suggestions, I assembled content logs
              | following each interview or observed session and at least one viewing of the
              | recordings was made in collaboration with another researcher. [16]
              | Drawing on interaction analysis procedures in concert with the theoretical
              | perspective developed by the combination of ANT and activity theory, I examined
              | the interviews with teachers and students for discussion of the ways they
              | perceive their practices to have changed in relation to TI-Nspire. Using the
              | themes identified from this analysis, I then examined the classroom and
              | lunchtime activity session video-recordings along with collected artifacts for
              | patterns of relations between human and non-human agents that relate to the
              | use of TI-Nspire. This analysis drew on the work of several ANT researchers
              | concerned with the spatiality of socio-technical networks (LAW, 2002; LAW &
              | MOL, 2001; SØRENSON, 2007). These researchers describe the socio-technical
              | networks that are enacted through the practices of human and non-human
              | agents in terms of "fluid spatiality." They suggest that the shape of socio-
              | technical networks is constantly adapting and is never fixed but, importantly,

              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | "while the connections which make a shape invariant in fluid space change
              | shape, they do so gradually and incrementally" (LAW & MOL, 2001, p.6). Paying
              | attention to the continuity of network-objects within fluid socio-technical networks,
              | I attended to the patterns of relations in the classrooms looking specifically for
              | gradual formations involving TI-Nspire. I then mapped these patterns of relations
              | to produce a snapshot of the fluid networks as they were enacted through the
              | activity of the human and non-human agents in the classrooms. [17]
              | 5. Findings
              | From the analysis of the interviews, observational recordings and artifacts I
              | identified and mapped patterns of socio-technical relations involving TI-Nspire.
              | This mapping resulted in a geography of connections with three key areas
              | representing different aspects of the classroom socio-technical networks that
              | were identified by participants as having adapted in relation to TI-Nspire.
              | Figure 2: Key socio-technical network areas [18]
              | These areas: locations of mathematical authority, locations of mathematical
              | tasks, and locations of mathematical activity are illustrated in Figure 2. In the
              | following sections each network area will be addressed and patterns of relations
              | between implicated network-objects in the classrooms will be discussed. [19]
              | 5.1 Locations of mathematical authority
              | One key area of the classroom socio-technical networks in relation to TI-Nspire
              | that was identified during interviews involves locations of mathematical authority
              | in the classrooms. Both teacher and student participants spoke about the role of
              | TI-Nspire as a source of mathematical guidance and way of checking answers. In
              | particular, teacher participants described students' asking TI-Nspire to answer
              | questions rather than coming to them, a phenomenon that they encouraged and
              | has been observed by a number of researchers in relation to other technologies
              | (MONAGHAN, 2004; PIERCE, STACEY & WANDER, 2010). During a debriefing
              | © 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/
              | FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:
              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | session, for example, one teacher spoke about how he had encouraged students
              | to go to their TI-Nspire when they were stuck on a problem involving the
              | application of a formula to determine the volume of a solid:
              | "So the minute [the student] writes down the volume formula he's like 'oh is that the
              | right one?' Like he wants to ask me, is that the right one, am I right? And we started to
              | make some progress at the beginning of the year, like I said 'when solving equations
              | don't ask me, check [TI-Nspire], it'll tell you if its right or not'" (teacher two). [20]
              | This practice of suggesting to students that the technology could be a source of
              | mathematical help and verification was also apparent during the observed
              | classes. Typifying the phenomenon, in one lesson that involved a period devoted
              | to completing a worksheet in pairs, the other teacher participant instructed the
              | class to, "Work through it, talk with each other, use the handheld to check what
              | you're thinking to see if its giving you what you expect" (teacher one). As this
              | teacher often did, he reminds the class that TI-Nspire can give them definitive
              | answers and help them to find misconceptions in their mathematical thinking. [21]
              | These practices reveal new patterns of relations between teacher and students in
              | terms of the sources of mathematical authority in the classroom. Speaking in an
              | interview about the resources students have for checking their mathematical
              | reasoning, one teacher noted,
              | "They do see this [TI-Nspire] as being in the hierarchy of who you trust. Like they'll
              | trust the textbook, they'll trust the teacher, they'll trust the handheld right? They'll be a
              | little sceptical of their partners but willing to listen" (teacher one). [22]
              | With the introduction of a technology that can provide trusted answers to a broad
              | range of mathematical questions, the role of the teacher as a source of
              | mathematical authority changes as students can turn to the technology to resolve
              | mathematical problems or disagreements with others. [23]
              | A network-object that directly relates to the role of the teacher and TI-Nspire in
              | terms of locations of mathematical authority is the textbook. Similar to the way
              | students were encouraged to use TI-Nspire to check answers before asking their
              | teacher, they also tended to use the technology instead of the answer pages at
              | the back of their textbook. Speaking about this behavior in an interview, one of
              | the teachers offered, "They've realized the limitations with the textbooks, that
              | their answers are wrong in the back of the book. Well there's a certainty and a
              | trust to this [TI-Nspire]—kind of that the answers are right" (teacher one). The
              | teacher indicates that he has noticed his students choosing to verify answers with
              | TI-Nspire because it is more reliable than the back of their textbook. This practice
              | was observed in the classrooms with both teachers encouraging the use of the
              | technology to check answers by verifying each component operation used in a
              | solution. During one class, the same teacher described some benefits of using
              | TI-Nspire to verify answers telling his students:
              | © 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/
              | FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:
              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | "The back of the book lets you know if your answer is right. It doesn't necessarily
              | know where your thinking went wrong ok? So you're not totally lost in space if you
              | don't have a TI-Nspire. If you're understanding this stuff and you're confident and
              | you're not making silly numeric mistakes. I want you-, Each question you do check
              | the back of the book. I don't want you doing 15 questions all wrong and then realising
              | after 15 you did them all wrong ok? Those of you with TI-Nspires, you don't need the
              | back of the book. You check each transformational move that you make, so each
              | equivalence transformation, write it down, put it in your handheld and see what you
              | get ok? So you'll know not only if your answer is right, you'll know if each move is
              | appropriate" (teacher one). [24]
              | By offering the possibility to check each step of a solution to a problem, the
              | teacher asserts that TI-Nspire affords students much more information than the
              | correct answer at the back of a textbook can provide in isolation. It can act more
              | as a guide than as a simple arbiter of correct answers. Reflecting this advantage,
              | both teachers encouraged their students to work with the technology and their
              | textbook by taking questions from the book but turning to TI-Nspire for guidance
              | about mathematical concepts and procedures. Speaking about the benefits of
              | this practice during an interview, one teacher explained:
              | "I think the TI-Nspire allows them to play around with partial understandings much
              | more comfortably than the textbook. You need to fit yourself into the correct ways that
              | the textbook proposes you do things and some kids just can't find it in themselves to
              | do that. So they can still be incorrect and playing around with their ideas and trying to
              | resolve them with the TI-Nspire with feedback all the time. The only feedback you get
              | with the textbook is 'I'm wrong'" (teacher one). [25]
              | This teacher notes that like the back of the textbook TI-Nspire can be used to
              | check if an answer is correct. He asserts that unlike the back of the textbook,
              | however, TI-Nspire is more flexible giving students more latitude to explore
              | mathematical ideas. The teacher suggests that when students are working on
              | questions from their textbook, the technology becomes a partner in the activity.
              | Similar to the relationship between teacher, student and TI-Nspire in terms of
              | locations of mathematical authority, the socio-technical network of student,
              | textbook and TI-Nspire affords new possibilities for learning that would be difficult
              | to realize with student and textbook alone. [26]
              | 5.2 Locations of mathematical tasks
              | We have just seen how new patterns of relations were formed with TI-Nspire as a
              | locus of mathematical authority in the classrooms. Now we will look at the ways in
              | which the mathematical tasks that were assigned to students were adapted.
              | Speaking to such changing practices, teacher one noted that by affording
              | students a more flexible way to work through problems, TI-Nspire had changed
              | the types of questions he felt comfortable assigning. Talking specifically about
              | assigning homework, he suggested:
              | © 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/
              | FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:
              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | "It's changed the nature of the homework that I give because if I'm assuming a kid
              | has access to this [TI-Nspire] at home what I can envision them doing is very
              | different than if all they have is their textbook and a notebook" (teacher one). [27]
              | Similarly, the technology also changed the way the other teacher gave
              | assignments. Instead of handing out a paper worksheet or assigning questions
              | from the textbook, teacher two often created self-contained digital documents
              | that he then distributed to each student's TI-Nspire (see Figure 3).
              | Figure 3: Two pages from a teacher created TI-Nspire digital document [28]
              | These digital documents contained pages such as those presented in Figure 3.
              | Each page contained different elements of an activity such as instructions,
              | questions, calculation, tables, graphing, and space for recording answers. Once
              | students had completed all the pages of an activity, the teacher could digitally
              | collect their work so that he could examine it on his own TI-Nspire or using a
              | computer based version of the technology. During an interview, the teacher
              | expressed a preference for this approach over the more traditional worksheet or
              | questions from the textbook saying:
              | "I kind of actually prefer to have [digital documents] cause I can open them up. I don't
              | have to cart around like this stack of papers. I can just cart around the files, they're
              | fairly small so whether it be on the handheld or on the computer, I can just look at
              | what they've done" (teacher two). [29]
              | While here the teacher focuses on pragmatic reasons for assigning digital
              | documents instead of using worksheets or the textbook, during a debrief after an
              | observed class he spoke about how using digital documents changed his
              | instructional practice. Discussing a session in which students were given class
              | time to work with a data set that described life expectancy for males and females
              | based on year of birth, the teacher spoke about how he had approached the
              | activity before TI-Nspire:
              | "What I've done before is I would have given them an instruction sheet. It's a double-
              | sided sheet of paper. There's a graph of the men's data so they didn't actually plot the
              | data or use the table of values. There was the graph, it asked them to draw the line of
              | best fit, it asked them to make the predictions on the data. The back side was the
              | women's, draw the line of best fit, make the predictions in the data like the years or
              | whatever that I've used and then the end of that activity I actually had them do it on
              | © 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/
              | FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:
              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | [an earlier graphing calculator model], graph it and have the calculator determine the
              | line of best fit and then we just compared the answers. So we said ok well this is the
              | answer you got, the line the calculator gave us, are they close, are they different?
              | And then we actually from there went about talking about how to create the line and
              | come up with the equation using a couple of the data points" (teacher two). [30]
              | When assigning the activity before having access to TI-Nspire, the teacher used
              | to ask students to graph the male and female life expectancy data sets on paper
              | and then draw lines of best fit. Then he had students enter the data into older
              | graphing calculators that do not have all the features of TI-Nspire. With these
              | more basic calculators, the students then used linear regression to produce lines
              | of best fit. The students could then compare their drawn lines of best fit to those
              | produced by the calculators. Since class time was limited and the teacher's goal
              | was to have students explore the concept of modeling trends in data through
              | lines of best fit, he did not see the approach as ideal. Graphing the data on paper
              | took a long time but allowed students to interpret and draw their own lines of best
              | fit while using the older calculators for graphing took less time but did not afford
              | students the chance to create their own lines of best fit. TI-Nspire, however,
              | allows much of the manual work of data entry to be eliminated while still providing
              | students the opportunity to create their own graphs and lines of best fit using its
              | graphical functionality. By providing students with a digital document containing
              | all the necessary data and instructions, the teacher was able to make what he
              | considered to be much better use of the available class time while still focusing
              | the activity on the interpretation of data. Particularly by reducing the time required
              | for students to perform tasks, the relationship between student and TI-Nspire
              | opens up new instructional possibilities that allow teachers and learners to focus
              | on mathematical concepts. In response to these possibilities, new patterns of
              | relations were found in the two classrooms between such network-objects as the
              | textbook and TI-Nspire that showed ways that the classroom socio-technical
              | networks adapted in terms of locations of mathematical tasks. [31]
              | 5.3 Locations of mathematical activity
              | While TI-Nspire may open up new instructional possibilities and ways of working,
              | it was not the only location of mathematical activity observed in the classrooms. It
              | was not even the only digital technology used. In the school that this study was
              | conducted, the teachers had dynamic geometry software such as The
              | Geometers Sketchpad™, and statistical and graphing software such as Fathom™
              | and Tinkerplots™ at their disposal. As is the case in many schools, however, this
              | software was hosted on computers in a lab that required classes to change
              | classrooms. By contrast, TI-Nspire is a mobile handheld device that can be used
              | in any classroom but has drawbacks particularly in terms of the limited size of its
              | screen and keyboard. These factors meant that the teacher participants had to
              | choose when to use TI-Nspire and when to use the computer lab. Discussing this
              | relationship, one teacher talked about how TI-Nspire relates to the computer lab:
              | "It's nice that there's a single tool that the kids can use for pretty much all the math
              | that we're doing right now. So if I can't get into the computer lab we can still do

              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | Fathom or Tinkerplots things with [TI-Nspire]. Or if we can't get in the lab and use
              | Sketchpad there are dynamic geometry things we can do with [TI-Nspire]. So the fact
              | that you've always got a computer lab at the ready without having to book it, march
              | the kids into a different location is really nice. So that this fits itself to the lesson rather
              | than the lesson having to fit itself to the technology" (teacher one). [32]
              | Because TI-Nspire is a handheld technology it is inherently more flexible than a
              | fixed computer lab in terms of where and when it can be used. As the teacher
              | notes, it does not necessarily need to be booked and unlike computer labs which
              | require moving the class to another location can be used for a short part of a
              | lesson. During the observed classes, both teachers used TI-Nspire at times for
              | short periods of focused activity that might have been impractical with a computer
              | lab. For example, guiding the class through the simplification of a polynomial by
              | writing on the blackboard and describing his actions, one teacher turned to TI-
              | Nspire during a discussion with two students about what the next operation
              | should be. The students had different views of how the expression could be
              | operated upon and the teacher asked them to put it in to the technology saying,
              | "For those of you with TI-Nspires just try putting that in and hit enter and see what
              | it gives you back" (teacher one). This kind of quick use of the technology would
              | not be practical if the class had to move to a computer lab. [33]
              | Beyond having the flexibility of a handheld device that can be easily transported
              | and used on an ad-hoc basis during a lesson, TI-Nspire was also seen by the
              | teachers as supporting richer mathematical conversation than traditional
              | computer labs. One teacher in particular indicated that part of his decision when
              | choosing TI-Nspire over taking his class to the computer lab was informed by the
              | idea that it's handheld nature lent itself to supporting or at least not hampering
              | conversation between students. He notes that, "The computer lab is a hideous
              | setup where kids are facing the wall around the outside and it's a bad setup for
              | learning, it's all about computers. The nice thing about [TI-Nspire] is it's not all
              | about the handhelds" (teacher one). Despite the perceived beneficial attributes of
              | TI-Nspire such as those the teacher refers to, many of its functions such as
              | dynamic geometry and graphing overlap with features of software often found in
              | school computer labs. The very size and portability of TI-Nspire that makes it
              | useful in some situations may render it clumsy and difficult to use in others. The
              | opinions and practices of the teachers show that a relationship exists between TI-
              | Nspire and the computer lab. While in many cases TI-Nspire was chosen over the
              | computer lab, it did not totally replace it and the socio-technical networks in the
              | classrooms adapted to accommodate both technologies. [34]
              | Another digital technology in the classroom that has a relationship with TI-Nspire
              | in terms of locations of mathematical activity is the interactive whiteboard. It
              | displays a projected computer screen and allows users to interact by touching
              | and writing directly on the image. Teachers can project a computer software
              | emulator version of TI-Nspire onto an interactive whiteboard and then manipulate
              | a large image of the handheld (see Figure 4).

              | Figure 4: Teacher using interactive whiteboard with TI-Nspire [35]
              | Despite this feature of interactive whiteboards that allow users to manipulate a
              | large projected version of TI-Nspire, in one of the observed classrooms the
              | teacher preferred to use a blackboard as the primary location of shared
              | mathematical activity. In this classroom, the blackboard was used in combination
              | with TI-Nspire and the translation of mathematical notation between the
              | technology and backboard was a key component of most of the observed
              | sessions. This teacher described how he had at first frequently used an
              | interactive whiteboard when he first introduced TI-Nspire to his classes but then
              | changed his practice saying,
              | "I used it a lot at first. I quite enjoyed using it, I use it less now. I don't like to use it as
              | demo because as soon as the lights go off its like it's a movie and the kids are just
              | like this [sits back in chair and folds arms]" (teacher one). [36]
              | In the other classroom, an interactive whiteboard was often used in combination
              | with TI-Nspire instead of the blackboard. It was the primary location of shared
              | mathematical activity in this classroom and was integral to the way TI-Nspire was
              | used. Describing his rationale for the arrangement, the teacher described, "It is
              | so important for them [the students] to be able to have access to it [the interactive
              | whiteboard] to be able to follow along. It just makes it a lot smoother" (teacher
              | two). By using an interactive whiteboard in combination with TI-Nspire, the
              | teacher demonstrated ways of working and discussed activities that in his class
              | were almost always assigned as self-contained digital documents. In addition,
              | students could and often did come up to the front of the class and share ways
              | they had approached problems or ways of working with TI-Nspire. For example,
              | during an observed session the teacher asked a student to use the interactive
              | whiteboard to show the class how she arrived at a solution to a problem:
              | © 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | Teacher says:
              | Student inputs:
              | TI-Nspire returns:
              | Teacher says:
              | Student inputs:
              | TI-Nspire returns:
              | Teacher says:
              | Go head punch it in on my calculator. As [student] punches it in
              | I'm going to describe what she's doing.
              | All right so the very first thing is just to enter the formula and
              | again it did simplify for us because six divided by three is two.
              | So the next step [student] did was to divide by two and she's
              | got 50 is equal to pi times r squared. [37]
              | Thus, using the TI-Nspire projected on the interactive whiteboard, the student
              | was able to replicate the work she had done on her handheld. This allowed the
              | class to discuss her approach to solving the problem without having to work with
              | a mediator such as a blackboard that would require them to translate between TI-
              | Nspire mathematical representations and hand-written forms. [38]
              | A theme that runs through the patterns of relations between TI-Nspire and other
              | network-objects such as the blackboard and interactive whiteboard in terms of
              | locations of mathematical activity is the crucial connection between the
              | technology and paper/pencil work. The importance of this relationship is also
              | indicated by the large amount of mathematics education research that focuses
              | upon the interaction between technological and paper/pencil mathematical activity
              | (ARTIGUE, 2002; CHAPPEL & KILLPATRICK, 2003; DRIJVERS & KIERAN,
              | 2006; KIERAN & SALDANA, 2005; TALL, SMITH & PIEZ, 2008). In the observed
              | classrooms, students worked with both paper/pencil and TI-Nspire collaboratively.
              | There were, however, marked differences between classes that relate directly to
              | the use of such network-objects as paper worksheets, textbooks, self-contained
              | digital documents, blackboards, and interactive whiteboards. In the class where
              | assignments were most often given via paper worksheets and the blackboard
              | was the primary medium for sharing with the group, students tended to work
              | predominately with paper/pencil with TI-Nspire acting as a partner in their
              | activities. In the class where most assignments involved self-contained digital

              | FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:
              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | documents and sharing with the group took place on an interactive whiteboard,
              | TI-Nspire tended to be the focus of student mathematical activity. [39]
              | Each teacher had distinct impressions of how TI-Nspire and paper/pencil could
              | be useful as parts of their instructional practices. As is the case with many of the
              | pedagogical views teachers have, these intentions shaped the role the
              | technology had in their classrooms (PIERCE, BALL & STACEY, 2009). During
              | interviews one teacher in particular spoke often about resisting the technology
              | becoming the focus during lessons. Discussing his choice not to find or create
              | digital documents and distribute them to his students, he explained:
              | "The documents I haven't used as much as I thought I would. And I don't think its
              | because there aren't documents out there that are good. It's just that I don't want it to
              | be about the documents, the lessons or the handheld. You know I would prefer it to
              | be in the background and the kids grab it when they need it" (teacher one). [40]
              | This teacher believed strongly that TI-Nspire should be one of many tools
              | available to students but that most mathematical activity should be on
              | paper/pencil. Sharing the view of a number of mathematics education
              | researchers (DRIJVERS, 2000; PIMM, 1995; STACEY, 1997), that handing-off
              | procedural tasks to technology may actually make conceptualizing mathematical
              | concepts more difficult, the teacher also expressed concern about TI-Nspire
              | becoming a black-box. He described his fear of TI-Nspire becoming an opaque
              | computational machine into which problems go and solutions come out without
              | any indication of the processes that have been performed. This motivated him to
              | de-emphasize the importance of the technology in his classroom, instead
              | choosing to focus mathematical activity on paper/pencil. [41]
              | The other teacher whose class was observed, had a distinctly different view and
              | spoke most often about the advantages of TI-Nspire being the primary location of
              | mathematical activity. Speaking during a debriefing session about a class in
              | which he had asked students to create a number of graphs so that they could be
              | compared, he offered:
              | "I don't think I would have got that discussion necessarily about the different points of
              | intersection for the male and female [datasets] today if I didn't have the technology.
              | Cause what would have happened is with, I don't know what did we have there 20
              | data points, some of the kids it would take them half an hour to graph 20 data points.
              | So by the time they get the one graph created and we get that line drawn that's
              | almost the entire period right? So you can spend a period let's say creating graphs
              | but now if you want to get through the graphs and just do talking about it and
              | analysing it and comparing it, it's so much easier to do in an instant have the graph
              | and now let's discuss" (teacher two) [42]
              | For this teacher, TI-Nspire made it possible to have more discussion and to
              | address more concepts than would be possible with paper/pencil. He saw these
              | advantages as outweighing concerns of black-box effects or the technology
              | becoming the focus of mathematical activity. In his classroom, the primary

              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | location of mathematical activity was TI-Nspire with the role of paper/pencil
              | greatly reduced even to the point that students often took notes on the
              | technology. This arrangement of the technology and paper/pencil is distinctly
              | different to the arrangement preferred in the other teacher's class and shows
              | some of the range of ways that socio-technical networks form in relation to TI-
              | Nspire and locations of mathematical activity. [43]
              | 6. Discussion
              | By examining the activity in classrooms where TI-Nspire is used, the findings of
              | this study illuminate ways that patterns of relations between teachers, students
              | and classroom materials adapt with the introduction of handheld technologies.
              | While only those adapted relations that participants expressed in their interviews
              | were discussed, this subset of the enormously complex set of mediators in
              | classrooms where handheld technologies are used shows the
              | interconnectedness of network-objects such as the teacher, the textbook,
              | worksheets, the computer lab, the board, paper/pencil, handheld technology and
              | students. In Figure 5, the connections between these network-objects that were
              | identified as having formed in relation to TI-Nspire are illustrated.
              | Figure 5: Geography of classroom socio-technical networks involving TI-Nspire [44]
              | This diagram represents a snapshot of the fluid networks in the two classrooms
              | and the network-objects within them. It shows not only the interconnectedness of
              | the socio-technical networks but also the overlapping roles of the network-objects
              | within them. The humans and materials identified in the diagram fall within three
              | overlapping areas that represent the roles they play in classrooms. While an
              | agent such as the teacher, for example, plays a much greater role within the
              | classroom than just being a location of mathematical authority, this is the role

              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | identified in terms of the networks formed in the two classrooms in relation to TI-
              | Nspire. [45]
              | The teacher was not the only agent of the socio-technical networks in the two
              | observed classrooms that acted as a location of mathematical authority. The
              | answers at the back of the textbook, software in the computer lab and TI-Nspire
              | also acted as locations of mathematical authority for students to draw on. This
              | changed the relationship between teacher and student, allowing students to
              | explore their thinking further before asking the teacher for help. PIERCE et al.
              | (2010) also found evidence of shifts in locations of mathematical authority in
              | relation to the introduction of TI-Nspire. They assert that technology capable of
              | being a source of mathematical authority changes the didactic contract between
              | teacher and student and shifts socio-mathematical norms in the classroom
              | (PIERCE et al., 2010). While they speak to the changed relationship between
              | teacher and student in terms of locations of mathematical authority with the
              | introduction of TI-Nspire, the present study adds to this work by identifying other
              | important relationships within classroom socio-technical networks that are also
              | implicated. The textbook in particular, was identified as also acting as a location
              | of mathematical authority whose relationship with students shifted in relation to
              | TI-Nspire. [46]
              | While the textbook was identified as a location of mathematical authority in the
              | two observed classrooms, it also served as a location of mathematical tasks.
              | Along with paper worksheets, the blackboard and interactive whiteboard and
              | digital documents on TI-Nspire, the textbook acted as a way mathematical tasks
              | were assigned to students. Each of these network-objects afforded the teachers
              | different possibilities in terms of the kinds of tasks they could assign with the
              | network of TI-Nspire and student having distinctly different properties to student
              | and textbook. DRIJVERS and KIERAN (2006) have also spoken to the
              | relationship between technology and the kinds of tasks assigned to students.
              | They assert that when a student undertakes a mathematical task with a computer
              | algebra system there exists a dialectical relationship between that task and the
              | technique they use from which mathematical theorizing emerges (DRIJVERS &
              | KIERAN, 2006; see also KIERAN & SALDANA, 2005). This speaks to the
              | interrelated nature of materials available to students and the kinds of tasks that
              | can be assigned. Findings drawn from the two observed classrooms in this study
              | support DRIJVERS and KIERAN's assertion by suggesting the introduction of TI-
              | Nspire certainly influences the kinds of tasks assigned to students but, in
              | addition, suggest that it influences the relationships between teacher, student and
              | other network elements such as paper worksheets and the blackboard and
              | interactive whiteboard. [47]
              | Apart from being implicated as a medium for assigning tasks, the blackboard and
              | interactive whiteboard also acted as a location of mathematical activity in the
              | classrooms. Together with the computer lab, paper/pencil and TI-Nspire
              | handhelds, the blackboard and interactive whiteboard served as locations of both
              | individual and shared mathematical activity. While none of these locations
              | replaced any of the others, they were all involved to greater or lesser extents in

              | Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology
              | the mathematical activity of each classroom. The student, teacher, board,
              | paper/pencil, computer software, and TI-Nspire were arranged in different ways
              | with each configuration supporting different activity. As several researchers have
              | suggested, in terms of learning perhaps what is most important is that multiple
              | locations of mathematical activity were available for students to work and share
              | with (DRIJVERS & KIERAN, 2006; KIERAN & SALDANA, 2005). [48]
              | During the course of this study, I was particularly struck by the relationship
              | between the activity students engage in individually and activity shared by the
              | whole class by means of a blackboard or interactive whiteboard. I found that the
              | materials that participate in this relationship have a distinct role in mediating
              | mathematical activity and that the interaction between students and materials in
              | one location had a particular influence on the other and vice versa. In the case of
              | this study, the materials were most often paper and pencil and TI-Nspire for
              | private activity, and blackboard and interactive whiteboard for public activity. The
              | complexity of the relationships among these materials, students and teachers as
              | they engaged in mathematical activity that I found in this study indicates that
              | more focused research with other materials and in other settings would help to
              | further our understanding of this important aspect of classroom practice. [49]
              | By taking an ANT approach that required me to attend to the interactions
              | between humans and non-humans in the classrooms while consciously trying to
              | limit a priori judgments about their roles and agency and by working with both
              | interviews and video-recorded observational data, the findings of this study
              | indicate that socio-technical networks in classrooms using handheld technology
              | operate as a complex interconnected whole. From interactional analysis of the
              | video recordings of the two classrooms, it is particularly evident that the effects of
              | the teachers' decisions to include TI-Nspire as part of their instructional practices
              | were not limited to, for instance, the local patterns of relations between student
              | and technology while completing an activity. These interactions are instead
              | extremely broad, influencing practices as diverse as homework and the use of the
              | computer lab. The findings of this study show as DRIJVERS et al. (2010)
              | suggest, that the didactical configuration of technologies in mathematics
              | classrooms has a profound effect on the mathematical practices within them but
              | also suggest that this is far from a one-way phenomenon. While teachers have
              | enormous influence through their choices of what technological arrangements to
              | use, other agents both human and non-human in the classroom mediate these
              | configurations and are highly interrelated. For instance, the choice to assign
              | activities as digital documents rather than as questions from the textbook may
              | influence the decision to share mathematical activity as a class with an interactive
              | whiteboard and may influence the decision to create digital notes rather than
              | work with paper/pencil. Each pattern of socio-technical relations mediates the
              | others and together they reciprocally shape the geography of the classroom. [50]
