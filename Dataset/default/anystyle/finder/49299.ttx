              | (LG) in exploring adolescent substance abuse from the perspective of mothers and their substance
              | abusing adolescent. We found the LG approach useful in building researcher-participant rapport,
              | enhancing participants' depth and range of recall, and cross-referencing and comparing of events
              | between participant accounts. These advantages are discussed in detail in this article, while we
              | also unpack some of the challenges we faced in using the LG approach in our qualitative study.

              | 1. Introduction
              | In qualitative studies, researchers often rely on retrospective data collection
              | methodologies to investigate people's experiences. When the inquiry involves
              | sensitive issues and requires participants to voice descriptive and emotional
              | stories, the use of appropriately sensitive data gathering methodologies is
              | imperative (GUENETTE & MARSHALL, 2009). In this article we describe the
              | utility of using a retrospective data collection tool called the lifegrid (LG) in
              | exploring adolescent substance abuse from the perspective of mothers and their
              | substance abusing adolescent children (hereafter referred to adolescents). [1]

              | Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents
              | We decided to use the LG approach to complement the case-study research
              | methodology as it has proved useful in previous studies in engaging with
              | participants, supporting them to talk about their experiences and collecting
              | retrospective information (WILSON, CUNNINGHAM-BURLEY, BANCROFT,
              | BACKETT-MILBURN & MASTERS, 2007). In addition, parents' lives and parent-
              | adolescent relationships are profoundly impacted by adolescent substance abuse
              | given the various psychosocial and economic stresses associated with
              | adolescent substance abuse (see for example JACKSON & MANNIX, 2003;
              | JACKSON, USHER & O'BRIEN, 2007; USHER, JACKSON & O'BRIEN, 2007;
              | WEGNER, AREND, BASSADIEN, BISMATH & CROS, 2014). In light of this we
              | surmised that the trauma that adolescents and parents may have experienced
              | could influence the kind of information they are willing to recall. In order to
              | facilitate recall of these events we thought to use a data collection tool that will
              | lend itself to recall and discussion of sensitive events. [2]
              | In the following sections we provide an overview of the LG and the methodology
              | of our study. We will then discuss our findings in relation to the usefulness of the
              | LG. Finally we outline some of the practical challenges we faced in using the LG
              | and provide some ideas on how to overcome these challenges. [3]
              | 2. About the Lifegrid
              | The LG is a tool used to construct a visual chronological framework of a person's
              | life (RICHARDSON, ONG, SIM & CORBETT, 2009; WILSON et al., 2007). It
              | generally takes a chart-like structure with several rows and columns, where the
              | rows usually represent the person's life in years (each row is a particular year)
              | and the columns represent significant life events (WILSON et al., 2007). The
              | significant life events are selected aspects of the participants' lives that the
              | researcher wishes to explore. These aspects are closely related to the research
              | questions of the study and can include topics such as family life, friends and
              | social relationships, place of residence, occupation and so forth. For example, the
              | LG was used to explore the life course of cancer patients using selected aspects
              | such as "personal life events," "education, lifestyle," "residence," "occupation"
              | and "other" (NOVOGRADEC, 2009, p.2). A completed LG then allows the
              | researcher to assess how the participant's life has changed over a certain period
              | of time and when these changes occurred. When the LG is used to facilitate
              | qualitative data gathering, it further allows the researchers to unpack how the
              | participants experienced and managed these changes. [4]
              | The lifegrid tool was developed to address research concerns related to
              | participant recall and validity in retrospective medical studies (BELL, 2005). It has
              | traditionally been used to collect quantitative data on the development of
              | illnesses, pain and health behaviors (BERNEY & BLANE, 1997; PARRY,
              | THOMSON & FOWKES, 1999; RICHARDSON et al., 2009). The core focus of
              | the earlier studies (see BERNEY & BLANE, 1997; BLANE, 1996) was to use the
              | LG to improve the accuracy of the recalled information (BELL, 2005). BERNEY
              | and BLANE's (1997) study assessed the accuracy of older participants' recall of
              | events that stretched over 50 years prior to the interview. The events they

              | Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents
              | focused on were "external" events like wars and strikes, "family" events such as
              | births and marriages, residential events and occupational events (ibid.). When
              | compared to the historical records of the participants, the findings indicated that
              | residential and occupational information, like fathers' occupation or residential
              | address, was recalled with more accuracy than detailed information on childhood
              | illnesses and dietary requirements (ibid.). [5]
              | Recent studies suggest that the potential of the LG extends beyond collecting
              | quantitative data and improving recall accuracy. Research by BELL (2005),
              | HARRISON, VEECK and GENTRY (2011), NOVOGRADEC (2009) and WILSON
              | et al. (2007) show the usefulness of the LG to facilitate participant engagement in
              | qualitative interviews. BELL (2005, p.53) however warns that while the LG may
              | improve the quality of the data collected, it could also restrict "the extent to which
              | interviewees feel able to discuss events not covered by the life-grid." In our study,
              | the LG was therefore used to compliment the semi-structured individual
              | interviews conducted with the participants and support them to talk about their
              | experiences. [6]
              | 3. Methodology
              | 3.1 Summary of formative work
              | The LG approach was piloted on one mother and her adolescent son who had
              | been admitted to a substance abuse treatment center for cannabis abuse (n=2).
              | The aim of the pilot was to determine how, and in what time sequence, we
              | needed to conduct the LG interview with the study participants. Additionally, we
              | were interested in identifying some of the initial significant life event categories
              | that we could include on the LG table for the overall study. Once identified, these
              | categories were included on the LG table as examples of significant events and
              | additional category options were provided should the participants identify other
              | significant events. [7]
              | Both the mother and the adolescent were interviewed at their home on three
              | occasions over a period of one month. The first interview was structured to build
              | rapport between the researcher and the participant and included questions about
              | the participant's family, school or work background, social relationships and
              | relationship with each other (parent-child relationship). Given that we wanted to
              | use the LG during the second interview, we also included questions that focused
              | on when certain experiences occurred and when relationships changed. For
              | example we asked the mother: "When do you think your son started using
              | drugs?" and "When did you start noticing a change in your relationship with your
              | son?" [8]

              | Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents
              | 3.1.1 Pilot interview with mother participant: Outcomes
              | Following the first interview with the mother, the interviewer (first author) partially
              | filled in the LG with some of the information that was gathered during the first
              | interview. The partially completed LG was then co-completed during the second
              | interview. In this case, the mother indicated that she would like the interviewer to
              | continue filling in the grid on her behalf as she did not want to do the actual
              | writing but was comfortable to do the activity. [9]
              | The second interview with the mother commenced with a recap of the LG. This
              | helped ensure that the mother was primed to discuss her experiences in greater
              | depth using the partially completed LG as a guide. The LG approach proved to be
              | useful during this interview both as a means to document information chronologically,
              | and facilitating the recall of events and experiences. It is our experience that the
              | LG was well received, appeared to be easily understood by the mother, and
              | allowed us to ask sensitive questions (described in the findings). [10]
              | 3.1.2 Pilot interview with adolescent participant: Outcomes
              | The pilot continued with the adolescent participant. Given the favorable outcomes
              | of the interviews with the mother, we decided to incorporate the LG during the
              | first interview with the adolescent to determine how he will respond to a blank LG.
              | The same processes were followed as with the mother: the LG was introduced
              | and explained to the adolescent and was then co-completed. This approach was
              | found to be acceptable because, as in the case of his mother, the LG appeared
              | to have been understood and easy to co-complete. Practically, using the LG in
              | this way also allowed the interviewer to check and therefore capture the
              | information more accurately without having to correct it in a next interview. The
              | findings section of this article will provide a more detailed account of the
              | usefulness of the LG in facilitating participant recall, discussing sensitive topics,
              | and cross checking and validating participant information. [11]
              | 3.2 Study participants
              | Given the various challenges associated with the accuracy of participant recall in
              | retrospective studies, researchers have since argued that the inclusion of
              | collateral informants are useful for increasing confidence (some would say
              | reliability) in subject self-report (AMODEO & GRIFFIN, 2009). We therefore
              | interviewed five parent-adolescent pairs, each consisting of one mother and her
              | adolescent who had been admitted to a substance abuse treatment center.
              | Discussions centered on issues pertaining to the development of the adolescent
              | substance abuse, experiences of parenting an adolescent substance abuser and
              | being an adolescent substance abuser (respectively) and the strategies parents
              | employed to cope with the adolescent's substance abuse. We were interested in
              | the participants' current experiences and feelings associated with the
              | adolescent's substance abuse, as well as their recollections of the past and how
              | this might have contributed to the way they currently feel. [12]
              | FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

              | Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents
              | Each participant was interviewed once using the LG method and the information
              | gathered during the LG interview was discussed in greater detail. Where needed,
              | each participant's LG was used to facilitate these additional discussions.
              | Scheduling of the interviews was also dependent on the availability of the
              | participants. The mothers and adolescents were interviewed separately and
              | confidentiality was strictly adhered to. This meant that none of the information
              | discussed with the mother was shared with the child and vice versa. Separate
              | interview schedules were developed for the mothers and adolescents, although
              | questions pertaining to the development of the adolescent's substance abuse,
              | parent-adolescent relationships, and parental coping strategies for the
              | adolescent's substance abuse formed part of both the interview schedules. This
              | data formed the basis of interviews on the second occasion using the LG. [13]
              | 3.3 Study processes
              | Following BELL (2005) and WILSON et al.'s (2007) examples, an A3 landscape
              | sheet of paper to map the interview with the mothers and their adolescents
              | children was used. The adolescents' LG comprised eleven columns by roughly 30
              | rows, depending on the age of the participant. The mothers' LG was eleven
              | columns by about 50 rows. Extra rows were provided in order to have enough
              | space should there be more than one significant event per year to document. In
              | using the LG we were interested in when significant events occurred and how the
              | participants experienced these significant events. We considered events
              | significant when they provided us with information on the development of the
              | child's substance abuse, the effects of the child's substance abuse on his/her
              | well-being, and the effects of the child's substance abuse on the mother and the
              | family as a whole. For example, one of the questions we asked the mothers was:
              | "when did you first become aware of your child's substance abuse?" with follow
              | up questions such as "tell me about how you felt when your child told you that he
              | was using drugs?," "when did you start feeling this way," and "how did you deal
              | with it (a particular challenge)? [14]
              | The participants generally requested that the interviewer complete the LG.
              | Although this was not planned, it ensured that "completing the grid did not
              | interrupt the flow of the interview" (BELL, 2005, p.56). Participants were then able
              | to engage with the questions and provide responses without being concerned
              | about issues such as spelling and whether they are doing it right. [15]
              | Given that a blank lifegrid could prove to be daunting to participants with complex
              | narratives (WILSON et al., 2007), we decided to introduce the participants to the
              | LG in the first interview indicating that we would return to it during the course of
              | our meetings. The interviewer explained that the LG will be used during the
              | interview to document particular issues as they emerge. It was also made clear
              | that there is no right or wrong answers and that the information that will be written
              | is fully dependent on what will be discussed during the interview. Lastly, it was
              | made clear to participants that their respective LGs will not be shown to one
              | another as to ensure that confidentiality is respected. [16]

              | 4. Findings
              | Drawing on extracts from our interviews, this section will discuss our findings on
              | the usefulness of the LG in relation to the following themes: Building rapport,
              | Enhancing depth and range of recall and Cross-referencing and comparing of
              | events. Each of these themes will be discussed in turn followed by a discussion
              | on some of the challenges that we encountered and how we resolved these. [17]
              | In this article, our interpretations of the themes are illustrated using extracts. In
              | these quotations, square brackets contain material provided by us for
              | clarification. Ellipsis points "(...)" indicate that the participants' thoughts have
              | trailed off and uppercase letters are used to illustrate emphasis. A pause is
              | illustrated by "(.)" and interruptions are indicated by "=." [18]
              | 4.1 Building rapport
              | We found the LG useful to establish interviewer-participant rapport and "breaking
              | the ice" (WILSON et al., 2007, p.140; see also HARRISON et al., 2011, and
              | PARRY et al., 1999). Following general introductory questions such as "tell me
              | about yourself," the interviewer used probing questions focusing on where and
              | when the participants were born, where they are currently residing, residential
              | movements, academic performance (for adolescents) and occupation (for adults).
              | The interviewer wrote this information onto the LG and the participant checked to
              | see if it was documented accurately. In line with findings presented by
              | HARRISON et al. (2011, p.221) the co-completion of the LG facilitated the
              | interviewer-participant relationship as it could be perceived as "a team working
              | together to complete a common task, much like two strangers collaborating to
              | complete a jigsaw puzzle." WILSON et al. (2007) add that the practical
              | completion of the LG averts the need for continuous eye contact which can
              | further put participants at ease, especially when sensitive issues are discussed
              | (also see HARRISON et al., 2011). Additionally, SHERIDAN, CHAMBERLAIN
              | and DUPUIS (2011) indicates that in using graphic elicitation methods like the
              | LG, the interviewer and participant reciprocally engage in the research which
              | could encourage the participant to become aware of his/her own agency (see
              | also KESBY, 2000). [19]
              | 4.2 Enhancing depth and range of recall
              | The LG proved an effective approach in encouraging participants to provide
              | detailed accounts of their experiences. While the LG was initially completed in a
              | chronological fashion using the biographical information, it was flexible enough to
              | allow participants to move between significant events when discussing their
              | experiences.

              | Interviewee: Yeah
              | Researcher: So your granny died somewhere?
              | Researcher: How old do you think you were?
              | Interviewee: Eight or nine that time" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [20]
              | Similarly, Abigail, a 16 year old girl who had been referred to the treatment center
              | for her harmful alcohol use, was able to control the discussion and talk about her
              | experiences as she remembered them. In this way she was not restricted by a
              | rigidly structured interview approach which may have prevented her from sharing
              | her story as openly as she has. In telling the interviewer about her drinking
              | patterns she is reminded of a particular event that she considers significant that
              | had occurred in the previous year, but had forgotten to tell the interviewer about it.
              | "Researcher: Okay I see, so then tell me about the next time you drank again.
              | Interviewee: Yah, after exams, HEY! I forgot something, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Now we
              | are going very back!
              | Researcher: Oh Glory! Reverse. Let's go back. Are we going back to last year?
              | Interviewee: Our last paper, me and my friends were at [a park]. So we buy [vodka],
              | we buy a six-pack, a six-pack of [ciders]. Yah those are the 3 things we bought and
              | we go chill at the park.
              | Researcher: How many of you were there?
              | Interviewee: Five.
              | Researcher: You were five with a bottle of [Vodka], a six-pack of [ciders]
              | Interviewee: No a six-pack of [a particular brand of ciders] and a six-pack of [another
              | particular brand of ciders]. And we drink the six-packs first. Okay Jess, one of my
              | friends, she didn't drink much. She only drank the six-pack she didn't drink the
              | Vodka. So we decided okay lets drink the Vodka. Now we in [the park] the worst
              | place to [be]! Anyway we didn't think of that at the time. So we drinking and uhm
              | [Laughter]
              | Researcher: Oh goodness, what did you do?
              | Interviewee: No, I didn't do anything wrong, I just passed out and the police van came
              | to fetch me and parents were called" (Abigail, 16 year old, alcohol abuser). [21]
              | This flexibility of the LG is apparent in the way that it allowed the conversation to
              | go back and forth between dates and/or significant events. This was useful as
              | associated events trigger memories that might not have been remembered. This

              | Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents
              | further allowed the interviewer and participant to document particular events and
              | discuss them in detail later in the interview or in a follow-up interview. This is
              | particularly important for sensitive research such as the current study as it allows
              | the participants the space to pause or return to certain issues when they are
              | ready to discuss those (WILSON et al., 2007). This was also a key finding in
              | timeline research conducted by SHERIDAN et al. (2011) on fatness and weight
              | loss. In this way, the LG also acts as a reminder to the interviewer about the
              | significant issues s/he wishes to discuss in detail which "provides direction to the
              | interview when needed (HARRISON et al., 2011, p.222). For example in the first
              | extract below, Winston talks about the supportive and comforting relationship he
              | felt he had with his cousin before his drug abuse. This conversation soon turned
              | very emotional for him and the interviewer decided to change the focus of that
              | discussion and asked him to comment on the support he received at the
              | treatment center.
              | "Researcher: So is that = what did you feel that time?
              | Interviewee: I felt like I never wanted to talk about it. But you see me and my small
              | cousin we use to talk about it.
              | Researcher: =Yeah
              | Interviewee: = we use to talk about our stories cause me and him we almost like the
              | same you see [emotional]
              | Researcher: I see, so how much younger is than you?
              | Interviewee: He's in grade 9 now.
              | Researcher: So you guys are, almost ... you close [in age]
              | Interviewee: Yeah we close [crying]
              | Researcher: So you had someone that you could speak to but it was a younger
              | cousin?
              | Interviewee: Yeah.
              | Researcher: Is that why you actually enjoyed being at [treatment center] because you
              | had that space to=
              | Interviewee: =talk to someone yeah" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [22]
              | Later in the conversation, the interviewer was able to ask Winston about his
              | relationship with cousin again.
              | "Interviewee: I never use to feel it [abusing cannabis] was wrong.
              | Researcher: Never felt it was wrong while you were smoking?
              | Interviewee: No
              | Researcher: But you felt it was wrong when other people, when this boy was with
              | you?
              | Interviewee: Yeah, only when my cousin was with me.
              | Researcher: So why is that? Why do you think you felt?

              | FQS 16(3), Art. 24, Candice Groenewald & Arvin Bhana:
              | Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents
              | Interviewee: No, because I felt, I know me and him were going through the same
              | thing. Now I don't want him to be like me! So I was trying to show him that there= no
              | I'm not in bad stuff and you mustn't do that there!
              | Researcher: Yeah, so you feel that you wanted to be a role model for him?
              | Interviewee: Yeah
              | Researcher: [pause] so this seems to be like difficult for you again, to speak about,
              | especially this particular topic.
              | Interviewee: I don't know, because when I was drinking ... I never want to show him
              | that I was still at it, I wanted to show him the good way, but I was still at it.
              | Researcher: And then talking about it now, makes you feel ...
              | Interviewee: Makes me feel bad" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [23]
              | Furthermore, while some researchers might argue that the information collected
              | in LG interviews can be elicited in conventional questioning, we found the LG
              | useful in encouraging the participants to tell their stories in a less confronting and
              | more innovative way (SHERIDAN et al., 2011; WILSON et al., 2007). WILSON et
              | al. (2007) point out that conventional interviewing have the potential to be boring
              | and repetitive. The LG, they argue, was useful in their work to discuss sensitive
              | issues without confronting participants with a long list of personal questions
              | (ibid.). SHERIDAN et al. (2011) further add that timeline interviews can represent
              | an "aide-memoire, focusing attention beyond what is possible through talk alone,
              | thus becoming not only a piece of data in its own right but a vehicle through
              | which further data were produced" (p.554). In this regard, it is our experience that
              | the LG itself represented the lives of the participants during the interviews in such
              | a way that it became the object of discussion rather than the parents'
              | experiences. This physical focus on the LG might have encouraged the
              | participants to tell their stories more openly as they are perhaps indirectly
              | reflecting on their lives, emotions and experiences through the LG. [24]
              | 4.3 Cross-referencing and comparing events
              | The LG is usually completed by one participant at a time (see for example
              | BERNEY & BLANE, 2003; HARRISON et al., 2011; NOVOGRADEC, 2009;
              | RICHARDSON et al., 2009; WILSON et al., 2007), although studies have used
              | the LG with couples who completed it together (BELL, 2005). We used the LG
              | with adolescent-parent pairs in which the adolescents and parents completed
              | separate LGs. This allowed us to compare the adolescent and parent's accounts
              | of similar events. In instances where the adolescent or the mother neglect to
              | discuss a significant event (like parents' divorce, death, admission to substance
              | abuse treatment centers, etc.) the interviewer was able to pick this up and
              | discuss it with the other. This was at times a challenging activity as it required the
              | interviewer to probe for significant events that were not mentioned without making
              | the participant aware that she received this information from either the mother or
              | child (bridging confidentiality). The extract below highlights the complexity, and
              | usefulness, of cross-referencing in our study. Jacky, who is the mother of
              | Winston, told the interviewer on a previous occasion that during his drug abuse
              | FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

              | Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents
              | Winston had left home for a while to stay with his brother. For us this was
              | significant as his brother was a cocaine user at that time and we were interested
              | in whether living with his brother encouraged his drug use.
              | "Researcher: Okay. And you were still with your mommy during that year you never
              | moved anywhere, or visit anybody?
              | Interviewee: No.
              | Researcher: Going to visit to?
              | Interviewee: I don't, only use to go visit my family there, the ones the ones that are in
              | [place], yeah only them
              | Researcher: And how [were] things with your brother during this time
              | Interviewee: My brother, he never use to stay here
              | Researcher: Here, but did you see him at all?
              | Interviewee: Yeah, he used to come see us.
              | Researcher: Yeah, and did go visit him at all?
              | Interviewee: Yeah I use to go visit him cause I use to see his son, cause his son
              | always, his son just use to like me ...
              | Researcher: Yeah
              | Interviewee: Yeah use to visit his son.
              | Researcher: That so cute ...
              | Interviewee: Then I use to visit his son.
              | Researcher: Big uncle ... so but you never, you just went visit him but you never use
              | to stay there or anything
              | Interviewee: I use to stay there but I use to come back home yeah.
              | Researcher: You came back home. So how long did you used to stay there?
              | Interviewee: It's about 3 months" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [25]
              | In a similar instance, Margaret, the mother of Abigail, indicated that she only
              | became aware that Abigail had used alcohol hazardously once she was caught
              | drinking at school and consequently referred to the treatment center. However,
              | Abigail's narrative reads differently and indicates that her mother had been aware
              | of her prior drinking habits. She explained that after she had gone drinking with
              | her friends in the park, she consumed so much alcohol that she "was knocked
              | out. I don't know what happened! The police came [and] parents were called."
              | "Researcher: So they call the parents to come get the children, so your mother
              | comes in and what does she do?
              | Interviewee: My mother was in the car and my guardian that comes to stay here
              | kicked and slapped me to wake me up, but I wouldn't wake up.
              | Researcher: You wouldn't wake up?
              | Interviewee: No, and they got me into the car. They got me home, I had a bath, and I
              | woke up the following morning, not feeling so good.
              | Researcher: And what happened with you and your mom?

              | Interviewee: She was quite angry with me. Very, very angry with me. That's when she
              | realized that I=
              | Researcher: You drink?
              | Interviewee: I drink, but then she thought I stopped, not knowing that I didn't actually.
              | And yes she was angry with me for a few days but then after me apologizing and
              | saying 'I'm sorry I didn't mean to disappoint you' she forgave me.
              | Researcher: Yes, but were you sorry?
              | Interviewee: Yes I was sorry. That was an embarrassment" (Abigail, 16 year old,
              | alcohol abuser). [26]
              | One possible reason why Abigail's mother did not tell the interviewer about this
              | occasion was that she, like Abigail, might have been too embarrassed by
              | Abigail's behavior. What this finding highlights is the significance of cross-
              | referencing and the usefulness of the LG interview in facilitating this process. In
              | the same way the LG allowed us to identify the silences in the participant pairs'
              | accounts; i.e. what the mothers identify as significant compared to what the child
              | does not (and vice versa). Moreover, the LG allowed for a visual cross-
              | referencing of life events where the interviewer was able to probe for the
              | participant's perception of the interrelatedness of certain life events (HARRISON
              | et al., 2011).
              | "Researcher: Okay.
              | Interviewee: I was living at my mother's home.
              | Researcher: Oh I see. Were your mother and father still together?
              | Interviewee: Yeah
              | Researcher: But he [father] was at the farm and you were this side?
              | Interviewee: Yes and then when they get married that time I was starting to use drug
              | Researcher: I see ... Oh I see when they got married?
              | Interviewee: Yes.

              | This reflection offered us further insights that extend beyond simply reviewing the
              | time-related associations between the life-events, which could be misinterpreted.
              | For example, should this cross-referencing not have taken place, the researchers

              | marriage. [28]
              | 5. Practical Challenges and Possible Solutions
              | We found the LG to be a flexible research tool that is useful in enhancing our
              | understanding of participant's experiences by facilitating discussion, building
              | rapport and allowing cross-referencing of life events and comparisons between
              | participants' accounts. However the LG approach is not without limitations. One
              | limitation of retrospective research in general is related to the accuracy and
              | reliability of the information provided by the participants. HARRISON et al. (2011)
              | propose that "we have no way of evaluating to what extent the memories
              | approximated a true rendering of the experiences of these participants" (p.223).
              | RICHARDSON et al. (2009) have also commented on this debate between
              | realism and constructionism and has argued for a middle-ground or pragmatic
              | perspective. RICHARDSON et al. (ibid.) suggest that recall and reconstruction
              | are interrelated concepts and that in qualitative research, the accuracy of the
              | recalled information is less important than meaning and experience. In our study
              | we were not only interested in when life events occurred, but also the subjective
              | experiences and meanings of these life events, and how these events influenced
              | and changed the lives of the participants. Given our focus on experiences (and
              | with concerns pertaining to recall in the back of our minds) we decided to
              | interview the mothers and adolescents while the adolescent was completing
              | his/her treatment at the rehabilitation centers. It is our experience that this
              | facilitated recall as the participants were reflecting on current and fairly recent
              | experiences. [29]
              | Furthermore researching sensitive issues, like those discussed in our study, is a
              | challenging task which required us to identify methodologies that are
              | appropriately sensitive while at the same time facilitative. Using the literature as
              | our guide (see for example BUTLER & BAULD, 2005; USHER et al., 2007), we
              | understood that talking about the adolescent's substance abuse would be a
              | difficult task for both the mothers and the adolescents (especially to a "stranger").
              | In this regard, we were cognizant of the possibility of selective recall where
              | participants are unable (or perhaps unwilling) to recall certain events, or show
              | selective recall bias in favor of what is "easier" to discuss. Studies show that
              | individuals have the tendency to forget information that they perceive self-
              | threatening (for full discussions on these issues, please refer to GREEN,
              | SEDIKIDES & GREGG, 2007; SAUNDERS, 2012). We therefore recognized that
              | participant recall, which was essential to obtain data that is information rich in our
              | study, was intrinsically dependent on our participants' abilities and willingness to
              | tell their stories. As put forth by BROWN and REAVY (2014) recall operates as a
              | shared activity and in our study the LG acted as a quasi-neutral stimulus to the
              | participants memories that accommodated the complexities of recall and
              | FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

              | Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents
              | facilitated discussions in a non-threatening and sensitive way and extended the
              | study beyond the traditional 1:1 interview. [30]
              | Some of the practical challenges (and solutions) we encountered with the LG are
              | also important to note here. Initially, the interviewer used a semi-structured
              | interview guide that posed questions chronologically which, as discussed earlier,
              | did not appropriately lend itself to the conversational and the non-linear way in
              | which the participants recalled their experiences. It is our experience that a
              | formative phase helps allay anxieties about the tool, but also serves to prime the
              | participant in identifying key questions and life events categories, such as
              | relationships, school, work etc. that will be discussed in the LG interview. It might
              | also be useful to identify possible life-events from the literature and incorporate
              | these in the LG interview. In some instances the participants thought that the LG
              | was a way for the interviewer to document aspects of the participants' lives rather
              | than an activity to be co-completed by the participants and the interviewer. Once
              | this was brought to the attention of the interviewer, she was able to explain in as
              | much detail as needed that the LG is way to facilitate discussions. It is therefore
              | useful for researchers to introduce the LG in such a way that the participants are
              | not distracted by the notion of providing the "right answer" but are comfortable to
              | discuss their experiences. [31]
              | When using the LG with participant pairs (collateral informants) it is important for
              | researchers to be careful not to "take sides" when cross-referencing and
              | comparing events. In our study we respected that the participants' accounts
              | reflected their subjective experiences and perspectives. We certainly recognized
              | the significance of the participants' silences and selective recall as it tells us
              | something about the significance of particular experiences. In cross-referencing
              | or comparing events between the participant pairs we were less interested in
              | whose accounts were "right" or "wrong." Rather we found the LG useful in that it
              | allowed us to use relevant information obtained from one participant (f.e., the
              | adolescent) to probe for more detail from the other participant (f.e., the parent).
              | This afforded us an opportunity to gain a more informed understanding of the
              | participants' experiences and perspectives. [32]
              | A further challenge relates to simultaneously conducting and analyzing the LG
              | interviews. Given the fluidity of the participants' conversations, it is important for
              | the interviewer to continually verbally note the dates (in days, months or years)
              | that they are referring to when discussing the life events during the interview. In
              | our study for example, the interviewer sometimes neglected to record time and
              | date sequences which may conflate events in the coding of the transcripts. This is
              | especially imperative for researchers who are interested in tracking changes in
              | life-events and experiences. [33]

              | 6. Conclusion
              | This article describes the utility of the LG in qualitative inquiries. We found the LG
              | approach useful in helping explore the breadth and depth of events as we were
              | not only interested in when significant events occurred but also the participants'
              | experiences of, and changes in, these selected areas of their lives. While the LG
              | worked well in our study, it is advisable that researchers conduct a formative
              | phase to establish key questions and life event categories so as to ensure that
              | their research questions are appropriately addressed. The LG as a tool and
              | approach will be particularly valuable to qualitative researchers who are
              | interested in retrospectively exploring sensitive emotional events in the
              | development of adolescent risk behaviors. [34]
