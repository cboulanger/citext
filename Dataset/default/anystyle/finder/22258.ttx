              | Academic Employment and Gender:
              | A Turkish Challenge to Vertical Sex
              | Segregation
              | ABSTRACT ▪ This article explores the paradox of women’s academic
              | employment in Turkey. There is a low rate of female labour market
              | participation in the formal sector, yet a higher proportion of women
              | professors than in any of the 25 European Union countries. We use a range of
              | data to set the Turkish labour market and its higher education sector in
              | comparative European perspective, then present ﬁndings from two qualitative
              | studies of Turkish professors, concluding that ideological state support rather
              | than legal frameworks of equal opportunities laid the foundations for women’s
              | hierarchical achievements in Turkey. However, the explanation is multilayered
              | and lies in the cumulative and interrelated effect of state policy, institutional
              | transparency, increased labour demand, the home–work interface, and the
              | agency of the professors themselves.
              | Introduction
              | At the end of 2004, the EU agreed to open accession talks which could
              | lead to Turkey’s membership of the Union. Its candidacy, if successful,
              | would realize the key national project of modernization and westerniza-
              | tion, which has been central to Turkey’s dominant state ideology. Turkey
              | is often excluded from comparative studies of European employment, yet
              | there are good reasons to include it.
              | There are important paradoxes in employment relations in Turkey:
              | women have one of the lowest rates of employment participation in
              | Europe, yet some beneﬁt from limited vertical segregation which would
              | be envied by their European sisters. In particular, women achieve more
              | hierarchically in the professions and academia than their contemporaries
              | in western Europe and elsewhere (Acar, 1993).

              | liberties movements have achieved legal solutions for the elimination
              | of discrimination against women. In practice, the impact of anti-
              | discriminatory legislation is often limited to widening women’s access to
              | employment, but has had less success in challenging vertical segregation.
              | In Turkey, by contrast, anti-discrimination legislation is less advanced,
              | but vertical segregation is lower. We examine this paradox by comparing
              | patterns of women’s activity rates in Europe with those of Turkey; then
              | focus speciﬁcally on academic employment. To understand what these
              | macro and meso data mean at the level of the actor (that is, the lived
              | experience of professorial employment), we use qualitative studies of
              | professors in Turkish universities.
              | To situate Turkey in its international context, we use Turkish data from
              | the Directorate General of Women’s Status and Problems in Ankara and
              | EU data from Eurostat and from Women in Science. To gain insight into
              | the policies and regulations on Turkish academic employment in general
              | and conditions of advancement to full professorial posts in particular,
              | documentary data were obtained from YÖK (the governing body of the
              | Turkish higher education sector) and the State Institute of Statistics.
              | Lastly, we undertook two qualitative studies, involving 57 semi-
              | structured interviews of Turkish full professors (30 men and 27 women).
              | The research was limited to ‘full’ professors, deﬁned as academic workers
              | holding professorial chairs at universities subject to YÖK’s progression
              | criteria. They were drawn from six universities in Istanbul and ﬁve in
              | Ankara, since professors in these cities face fewer structural constraints
              | associated with their geographical career mobility.
              | The interview schedule consisted of 32 questions exploring the socio-
              | economic and institutional proﬁles of the respondents and allowing them
              | a degree of freedom to determine the issues that they wished to discuss
              | within a broad framework of sex equality, career development, and higher
              | education in Turkey. Interviews were undertaken in Turkish and the tran-
              | scripts translated into English.
              | Women’s Activity Rates: Turkey in Comparative
              | Perspective
              | Turkey has one of the lowest female economic participation rates in
              | Europe — one which actually decreased from 34 percent in 1990 to 23
              | percent in 1995. The vast majority work in the agricultural sector as
              | unpaid family workers, while employment in the non-agricultural and
              | non-rural sectors is highly marginal not only quantitatively, but also in
              | terms of concentration in traditional female sectors such as textiles and
              | the food industry. Urban unemployment rates for women are more than
              | double those of men; the informal sector provides the greatest work

              | ence of liberalization has not increased women’s participation in the

              | internal migration from rural to urban areas in the past decade, has led to

              | a skewed distribution of employment by gender (Özbilgin and
              | Woodward, 2003).
              | Male workers in Turkey are over-represented in forms of employment
              | that require lower educational qualiﬁcations. Women’s relative partici-
              | pation rates increase with their educational levels, and this is particularly
              | marked for those with tertiary-level education. Nevertheless, OECD
              | (2004) data indicate that women with tertiary education still have
              | comparatively low levels of activity: below all other European countries,
              | on a par with Japan, and above only Korea and Mexico.
              | It is noteworthy that the 12 European countries with the highest
              | activity rates for women are the four Nordic countries and eight of the
              | central and eastern European (CEE) countries. The lowest activity rates
              | tend to be in southern Europe. The extent to which these ﬁgures are
              | directly comparable has been questioned by a number of commentators,
              | since different deﬁnitions of employment, unemployment, and inactivity
              | signiﬁcantly affect the data. For example, the southern countries, includ-
              | ing Turkey, tend to have a high share of informal-sector work. Within the
              | Eurostat deﬁnitions of economic activity, the trend among women is
              | towards increasing employment rates and decreasing inactivity rates
              | (Rubery et al., 1998).
              | Academic Employment and Gender Equality
              | Given the very low economic activity rates of Turkish women, and the
              | predominantly Muslim population, it may surprise many western
              | commentators that the proportion of women academics who achieve
              | professorial status is very high (Özbilgin and Healy, 2004; Woodward
              | and Özbilgin, 1998). Thus gender equality in Turkish academic
              | employment can provide comparative insights to relate to the findings
              | of other country-specific studies.1
              | A prerequisite of women’s success in academia is their prior success in
              | tertiary education. In 2002, the average percentage of graduates who were
              | women was 55.9 percent in the EU-15 and 63.7 percent in the accession
              | countries. In science in general and in engineering and manufacturing,
              | there was a higher percentage of women graduates in the accession coun-
              | tries (48 percent and 25.6 percent, respectively) than in the EU-15 (41
              | percent and 20.9 percent, respectively). Turkey stands out as having a
              | lower proportion of women graduates (42.9 percent) than any of the EU-
              | 25 or associated countries. However, the feminized subject bias is less
              | entrenched in Turkey, with women representing 44.4 percent of science
              | graduates and 34.8 percent of those in engineering and manufacturing
              | (Eurostat, 2004). However, Palaz (2000) argues that recent trends indicate
              | a shift towards a more western style of horizontal gender segregation,

              | Figure 2 shows the average percentage of women academics in the
              | EU-25 as 34.8 percent. There is, however, a wide range, from Latvia,
              | where women make up more than 50 percent of academics to Ireland
              | where they are only 24.6 percent. Of the 13 countries above the mean,
              | six (including the top four) are from the CEE, two (Spain and Portugal)
              | from southern Europe, and three from the Nordic countries, together
              | with the UK. Turkey is also just above the mean. There is no clear
              | pattern by groupings of countries; nor does the gendered distribution
              | of academic employment match national rankings of economic activity
              | rates.

              | under-represented at professorial level, holding on average only 14
              | percent of such posts. Some 11 countries are above the mean: four from
              | the CEE (of which only Latvia and Bulgaria have a higher than average
              | proportion of women academics) and four from southern Europe, plus
              | Belgium and the UK. At 27 percent, Turkey has the highest proportion
              | of professors who are women in Europe, almost twice the mean. Curi-
              | ously, countries with a long history of egalitarian policies, such as
              | Norway and Denmark, are below the mean.
              | Data from the European Technology Assessment Network (ETAN,
              | 2000) show that in many countries the percentage of female full professors
              | slowly increased in the 1990s. In Poland, for example, women were 9.4
              | percent of titular professors in 1977, 16.6 percent in 1988, 20 percent in
              | 1990, and 21.9 percent in 1996. While these kinds of data are not generally
              | available, its report also provides the example of Germany, where year-on
              | year-increases are not evident. On average in the EU, percentages of
              | women professors seem to be increasing by 0.5–1.0 percent a year — at this
              | rate it would take a century to attain a gender balance (ETAN, 2000: 12).
              | There are many possible reasons for Turkish women’s academic achieve-
              | ments, many rooted in speciﬁc historical, social, and economic contexts.
              | Before turning to these, we pursue a more generic explanation: women
              | succeed when men leave an occupation because the rewards are greater
              | elsewhere. Reskin and Roos (1990) argue that men may vacate certain
              | sectors or occupations if terms and conditions of employment decline, and
              | that women can compensate for the resulting labour shortages. While this
              | argument may have some resonance in particular countries, our own
              | research suggests that it does not hold good if the gendered distribution of
              | professorial appointments is compared cross-nationally with academic pay
              | (adjusted for purchasing power) (Özbilgin and Healy, 2004).
              | Historical Forces and Women’s Achievements in Turkey
              | The dominant state ideology in Turkey has historically been a major
              | factor in understanding vertical segregation, a factor shared with CEE
              | accession countries. The foundation of the new Turkish Republic in the
              | early 1920s led to a series of reforms aiming to nationalize and secular-
              | ize the higher education sector. The move from the earlier Seljuk and
              | Ottoman systems to the contemporary university system embodied a
              | shift in emphasis from Turkish-Islamic to westernized models, and from
              | a nationalized system to one which is governed by a neo-liberal inter-
              | nationalist approach (Güvenç, 1997). These changes can be periodized
              | into three phases.
              | The first phase, in the 1920s and 1930s, led to the entry of women
              | into academic employment through a set of principles (secularism,

              | duced by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the modern Turkish
              | Republic. These principles were part of a modernization project later
              | synonymous with the concept of ‘Kemalism’. The principles were
              | consolidated in the second phase of transformation from the 1940s to
              | the 1980s, as the number of women academics gradually increased
              | (YÖK, 2004). A relatively stable growth rate of the university sector
              | has been replaced since 1985 by a third phase of rapid expansion.
              | The ﬁrst two phases underpinned an ideological sanctioning of
              | women’s careers in academia and the professions. The Kemalist principles
              | of republican secularism upheld the value of sex equality over and against
              | a strong tradition of sex segregation originating from the Ottoman times
              | (Öncü, 1981; Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000). Legislation requiring sex
              | equality in employment was rudimentary (Özbilgin, 2002; Woodward
              | and Özbilgin, 1999),2 but of critical importance was that the dominant
              | ideologies of ‘modernization’ and ‘westernization’ gave priority to the
              | elimination of overtly discriminatory policies and practices from the
              | formal processes of public employment.
              | Though the post-communist countries are also shaped by a state
              | ideology of sex equality, the ideological differences with Turkey are
              | profound. James (1996: 45, 59) asserts that under communist rule, women
              | were strongly encouraged to enter the labour force, but that the policies
              | were designed to foster equal numerical participation in the labour force,
              | not equal access to high-status jobs and wages. To facilitate numerical
              | participation, childcare and maternity leave were heavily subsidized by
              | the government (although this subsidy has been substantially reduced in
              | the market economy). This facilitated women’s relatively high economic
              | activity rate. Analogous ideological and practical supports also underlie
              | the high participation rates in the Nordic countries.
              | Zeytino g˘lu (1999) and Kandiyoti (1997) noted that academic careers
              | were historically and socially constructed and sex-typed as ‘safe’ and
              | ‘proper’ choices for graduate women in Turkey. Women were socially
              | encouraged to take up professional employment, as opposed to entre-
              | preneurial or commercial careers, since these were considered harmoni-
              | ous with the potent image of ‘a respectful Turkish woman’. This ideology
              | was effective in demarcating women’s careers in ‘safe’, ‘secure’, and
              | ‘esteemed’ forms of professional employment.

              | ‘state feminism’ (White, 2003). First, since the 1980s Turkey has pursued
              | a neo-liberal economic programme, weakening government labour
              | market regulation. This has diluted the traditional sex equality discourse
              | of the republican ideology pursued by the state in all sectors, including
              | higher education. Second, there have emerged political parties and
              | economic institutions that advocate sex segregation, in clear opposition
              | to the principles of secularism. Nevertheless, the current leading party,
              | the AKP, despite its Islamic agenda, has adopted a liberal approach and
              | discourse.
              | These two changes have led to a shift in social attitudes. The image of
              | republican Turkish women, expected to ‘self-sacriﬁce’ and ‘pioneer’ for
              | the advancement of the nation, has lost its inﬂuence on a new generation
              | of young women graduates (Özbilgin and Woodward, 2003). It could be
              | argued that, like their counterparts in other European countries, many
              | women in modern Turkey perceive their careers with individualized
              | aspirations rather than a collectivist sense of fulﬁlling a national duty.
              | Thus, as the nationalistic and republican signiﬁcance of women’s employ-
              | ment in non-traditional disciplines is declining in Turkey, traditional
              | methods of eliminating sex-typing and segregation of academic careers
              | are following suit in higher education.
              | Alongside the fragmentation of state ideology, there have been signiﬁ-
              | cant sectoral changes in the past two decades. The expansion of the
              | university sector since the early 1990s has created greater opportunities
              | for career mobility for both female and male academics. Between 1990
              | and 2004, the number of universities increased from 29 to 76; the number
              | of state universities almost doubled and there was also an emergence of
              | private universities. The number of academic staff increased from 28,114
              | in 1989 to 60,129 in 1999, and professorial posts from 2772 to 8804 in the
              | same period, increasing to 10,080 in 2003 (YÖK, 2004). Between 1990
              | and 2000 the number of full professors increased by 75 percent (Aytaç
              | and Aytaç, 2001: 17). The skills shortages which resulted from this expan-
              | sion enabled increased access for women and were also largely respons-
              | ible for mobilizing the upward progression of the otherwise relatively
              | static careers of many academic staff in this sector.
              | While student participation has increased in Europe, this increase has
              | not necessarily led to comparable career opportunities, given the shift
              | from ‘elite’ to ‘mass’ in higher education delivery. Nevertheless, Enders
              | (2002) argues that academic staff in Portugal and Spain beneﬁted from
              | expansion; and as noted above, these are the two southern European
              | countries with rankings for women’s academic employment above the
              | European average.
              | Expansion of the sector in Turkey occurred alongside a deterioration
              | of pay and conditions in the ‘old’ universities in the state sector, as
              | compared to the ‘new’ private universities. It is unclear how the growth

              | of private universities will affect the gender order, given their relatively
              | small share (only 3 percent) in the sector (Aytaç and Aytaç, 2001: 20).
              | Özgüç (1998) suggested that male graduates traditionally pursued careers
              | which offered the best ﬁnancial prospects and had limited and declining
              | interest in academic careers because salaries were lower than in the private
              | sector. This has resonance with the gender queues argument of Reskin and
              | Roos (1990), which suggests that changing market conditions may lead to
              | the feminizing of previously contested jobs. In the case of Turkey, as in
              | Spain and Portugal, it is new jobs that are offering women opportunities.
              | Centralization of Rule Making: YÖK
              | One of the inﬂuences on women’s academic development involves the
              | institutional level. The governance of the university sector has been trans-
              | formed from a decentralized system in the 1970s to one of centralization,
              | embodied by YÖK, in the 1980s and the 1990s. YÖK and its various
              | policies, which were often considered gender neutral, had a signiﬁcant
              | gendered impact on the careers of female professors. Particular changes
              | in YÖK legislation, with a direct impact on the career development of
              | academic staff, deﬁned the performance criteria and mobility require-
              | ments that regulated professorial promotions. YÖK has been criticized
              | by many universities, academic staff, and their unions and associations
              | (TUSIAD, 2000: 113), and challenges to its status have resulted in some
              | 30 revisions to its constitution since its establishment in 1981.
              | Nevertheless, the promotion system in the Turkish higher education
              | sector has a high degree of transparency compared to European coun-
              | tries. YÖK regulations require professorial vacancies to be advertised in
              | one of the ﬁve highest circulation daily newspapers in Turkey (Özbilgin
              | and Healy, 2004: 7). Candidates have to provide a portfolio including
              | their CVs, details of their scientiﬁc publications, educational and training
              | activities, supervision of research degrees, and overall contribution to
              | their current institution. Three conditions are speciﬁed for promotion to
              | full professorship: ﬁrst, applicants should have served at least ﬁve years
              | at associate professor grade in a discipline closely associated with the
              | professorial post sought; second, they should have a portfolio of original
              | research publications produced at an international level; and, third, they
              | should be selected for a professorial post (TUBA, 2004; YÖK, 1998).
              | These regulations make no implicit or explicit reference to sex equality
              | issues, such as direct or indirect discrimination in promotion or selection
              | processes. Once candidates qualify through YÖK for a professorial chair,
              | they must also be appointed to a chair by their local university in order
              | for their title to be recognized. Each Turkish university, both state and
              | private, has its own promotion system; some are reportedly tougher than

              | the YÖK procedure, placing heavier emphasis on research output in the
              | form of international publications (Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000: 85).
              | This creates a two-track employment system.
              | Nevertheless, Özbilgin and Healy (2004: 8) argue that this standard-
              | ized system of recruitment is more open and, in principle, provides
              | greater equality of access to full professorial posts than in many other
              | countries, where such standardization is rare. The appointment of pro-
              | fessors in Europe and the US often involves multiple systems; many of
              | these are obscure, allow variable criteria for appointment, and often rely
              | on internal labour markets. The most open systems rely on the require-
              | ment for similar attributes to those under the YÖK system. While many
              | western academics assume that their professorial appointment systems
              | are of an equal or superior academic level to those of other, particularly
              | less developed, countries, such assumptions should be questioned
              | particularly in debates on gender equity. The ETAN (2000: viii) report
              | on mainstreaming gender equality in Europe stated that old-fashioned
              | practices permeate employment and promotion procedures in many
              | academic institutions: patronage, ‘old boys’ networks’, and personal invi-
              | tations to ﬁll posts cut across ‘fair and effective employment procedures’.
              | Despite the greater transparency in the Turkish system, it is important
              | to recognize that competition for posts in particular universities and
              | organizational politics militate against universally equitable outcomes
              | (Özbilgin and Healy, 2004: 8). In this, Turkey shares a common experi-
              | ence with western European and North American university systems.
              | The Lived Experiences of Turkish Professors
              | We now turn to qualitative evidence at the microlevel. While we acknowl-
              | edge women’s achievement in academic work in Turkey, it is important
              | to remember that those who achieve hierarchical success are still rela-
              | tively rare. To explore the perceptions of men and women professors, we
              | focus on two key interrelated elements of their employment relation-
              | ships: the home–work interface and structures of discrimination.
              | Home–Work Interface
              | There are both universal and nationally speciﬁc dimensions to our
              | ﬁndings. Though Turkish women have attained professional careers for
              | some eight decades, the traditional family ideology and gender division
              | of labour, which assigned carer and domestic roles to women and bread-
              | winner roles to men, remains the main social frame of reference (Peker,
              | 1996). Our study of senior academics reveals a near universal picture of
              | gendered domestic roles and responsibilities. Women are responsible for

              | Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Gender
              | managing the household; men ‘help’ rather than sharing domestic tasks.
              | The ‘normality’ of this was indicated by an apparent lack of association
              | between domestic responsibilities and career development. None of our
              | male respondents mentioned family affairs as hindering their promotion
              | (one stated that ‘I’m involved in my own academic tasks usually, some-
              | times I help her with the housework’), but nor did female professors
              | recognize structural barriers. They reported that they were largely
              | content with (or perhaps resigned to) their dual roles, and often normal-
              | ized the burden caused by domestic work by failing to question the role
              | distribution.
              | The following statement by a female professor is typical: ‘Actually
              | family did not hinder me but when my children were younger I had difﬁ-
              | culties in doing research, teaching, working and also taking care of the
              | house’. Another explained this paradoxical situation:
              | I believe that there is equality between the sexes. However, once you
              | enter the academic profession, the difﬁculties they [women and men] face
              | are different. However much men help, responsibilities of caring for the
              | family and children are expected of women . . . It is very positive for a
              | woman to have an academic career. It has high social status. It is not
              | important if she earns less. However, if men earn less, they are victimized.
              | The paradox is complicated by the expectation that women will marry
              | upward socially, and those who are highly qualiﬁed thus ﬁnd a reduced
              | pool of potential partners. Accordingly, some 41 percent of women
              | academics are married to other academics (Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000:
              | 30). The established gender order in the home constrains such women’s
              | employment ‘choices’ (Healy, 1999). Dual-career families in the study,
              | and other female academics, often employed domestic help to redress the
              | imbalance in the share of domestic work. A male professor explained that
              | ‘having assistance reduces my wife’s domestic responsibilities. We have a
              | commercial cleaning service. My wife is responsible for cooking’.
              | Female respondents recognized gendered structural constraints for
              | men and suggested that ‘ﬁnancial responsibilities of being a man’ and
              | ‘compulsory military service’ are the main hindrances for men’s career
              | advancement in the sector. One male professor stated that barriers to
              | career development exist only for men for these reasons, while other men
              | saw marriage and childcare as important barriers to women’s career
              | development. Neither marriage nor childcare appeared to constitute a
              | problem for male respondents.
              | Women respondents appreciated men’s help and contribution to their
              | career. ‘My mother and father supported me both in material and spiritual
              | ways until I lost them,’ said one. ‘Since I got married, my husband has
              | been supporting me by being understanding about my work and
              | exchanging ideas with me’. Only ﬁve of the 30 male professors

              | acknowledged the support of their immediate families; another ﬁve cited
              | support received from their colleagues.3 As well as the support of their
              | immediate families, female professors mentioned friends and colleagues.
              | PhD supervisors were highlighted as important sources of support at
              | both the academic and emotional level.
              | The role of signiﬁcant others, particularly partners, is a recurring
              | theme in the literature on women’s achievement (Healy and Kraithman,
              | 1996; Ledwith et al., 1991). Deem (2003), in her study of women
              | academics in the UK, found that most women raised gender issues
              | ranging from inequitable household and motherhood responsibilities to
              | sexist behaviour by some male colleagues and discrimination in
              | promotion. The link with the male domestic contribution is important in
              | moving to gender equality. As Esping-Andersen (2002: 124) argues,
              | neither social nor labour market policies alone will produce such
              | equality; he identiﬁes the ‘admittedly weak feminization of the male life
              | cycle’ as a barrier to equal career opportunities in the Nordic countries.
              | Structures of Gendered Discrimination
              | Women in Turkey face further structures of gendered discrimination, yet
              | the perception of gendered disadvantage was not high among our respon-
              | dents. When asked about barriers that they faced as academic workers,
              | there was, however, a gendered variation. Many male professors claimed
              | to have faced no disadvantages or barriers, but a few identiﬁed insti-
              | tutional constraints in the promotion procedures. While many female
              | professors argued that they had not experienced personal barriers to their
              | career development, some did identify barriers to their career advance-
              | ment, such as lack of support from family and friends, undergoing a
              | divorce, having a child with a disability, and administrative obstructions.
              | In general, while men tended to perceive institutional constraints, women
              | were more likely to perceive familial constraints. One female professor
              | suggested that men have inherited advantages in social life which spill
              | over into academic life: ‘I think that women’s success is not easily
              | accepted by women and men . . . Men are performing their professional
              | duties more independently compared to women. They are already
              | conditioned to be successful in academic and social life’.
              | Some male professors accepted that there is gender discrimination in
              | working life, but not in academic life. The belief in the high prestige and
              | reputation of the profession conceals some inequalities, implying a
              | perceived superiority and lack of discrimination in the academic
              | profession. As one commented, ‘gender discrimination is not a signiﬁcant
              | issue here [in the university] and being men or women is beyond question
              | in an academic institution’. The underpinning assumption is that the
              | socially privileged position of academic workers in Turkey, particularly

              | Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Gender
              | full professors, must give them some degree of immunity from discrimi-
              | nation: ‘I do not believe in discrimination in this profession. Women face
              | discrimination in lots of other sectors but not in the university system’.
              | The issue of gender discrimination is almost invisible to male professors,
              | who are mostly very certain that there is no sex discrimination in
              | university or academic life. ‘There are no barriers to women in Turkey in
              | this area. I’ve never encountered it even in the most conservative places.
              | Male colleagues also do support them [women]’.
              | The belief in the equitable ideal of employment recurs in other Turkish
              | studies, for example of universities (Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000: 65) and
              | banking (Özbilgin and Woodward, 2003). This belief is, nevertheless,
              | often accompanied by the view that women academics should work more
              | than men in order to achieve career success. However, this view was not
              | universally shared by women: as one respondent insisted, ‘all the discrim-
              | inatory factors that exist in social life prevail in academic life as well’.
              | Discussion and Conclusions
              | Mischau (2001: 25) has remarked that ‘there is no university where the
              | percentage of female professors corresponds with the percentage of
              | female academic staff or students’. While Turkish women’s progress in
              | academia seems greater than their European counterparts, this success is
              | not underpinned by a critical mass of women academics nor by wide-
              | spread labour market activity by women. It is evident that strong
              | historical and national forces have been the main incentive for educated
              | women to contribute to the modernization of Turkey; whereas in
              | Europe, the major impetus has come from legislation designed to combat
              | the negative effects of discrimination.
              | We have concentrated on Turkey, but we recognize that some of the
              | characteristics identiﬁed for Turkey may be shared with other European
              | countries, notable those in the CEE. What distinguishes Turkey is the
              | contradiction between women’s low labour market participation and
              | their success in the professions, which seems counter-intuitive to the
              | western eye. Most western commentators seek remedial measures for
              | gendered discrimination in the strengthening of legislation. For Turkey,
              | this class of women beneﬁted not from legislation, but from a strong state
              | ideology of equality. This ‘state feminism’ resulted from the rupture with
              | the Ottoman Empire in 1923. Thus revolutionary change transformed the
              | lives of middle-class women.
              | Academic women felt the impact of this transformation. At the insti-
              | tutional level, it was underpinned with the introduction of YÖK: the
              | transparency of its employment policies has facilitated women’s progress.
              | This transparency is continually sought by feminists in universities in

              | Europe and North America, but often with at best partial success. Never-
              | theless, to make an obvious point, for women to achieve hierarchical
              | success in an occupation, they must take jobs from men or must beneﬁt
              | disproportionately from an increase in employment opportunities for
              | both. Part of the cumulative explanation of women’s success in Turkish
              | academia could be the exodus of men from the profession, consistent
              | with the interpretation by Reskin and Roos (1990) of the feminization of
              | some North American occupations. Given Turkey’s comparatively low
              | level of academic pay and the associated view that academic work is no
              | longer attractive for men, this argument might seem persuasive. However,
              | Eurostat data do not support this interpretation: academic salaries in
              | Turkey, in terms of purchasing power, are not lower than those in coun-
              | tries with a far lower proportion of women academics. It is the expan-
              | sion of the university sector that has provided new opportunities for both
              | women and men.
              | Nevertheless, Turkish women face severe career constraints. A strong
              | family ideology continues to result in the underemployment of women
              | with tertiary education. At the same time, the family can have contradic-
              | tory functions: our study demonstrates its importance in enabling and
              | facilitating women to develop their academic careers. The women pro-
              | fessors also demonstrated that they used the degrees of freedom available
              | to develop their careers and allow their ‘choices’ to become a reality.
              | Their constrained agency was accepted within the societal context, and it
              | appeared that the support they received was conditional on respecting the
              | bounds of the family ideology.
              | Esping-Andersen (2002) argues that there exists a broad consensus on
              | what constitutes women-friendly policy. It includes affordable day care,
              | paid maternity and parental leave, a right to leave when children are ill,
              | and the ability to match work with school hours. But he adds that this is
              | not sufﬁcient: there is a need to change both gendered choices and
              | societal constraints, including an inducement to men to embrace a more
              | ‘feminine’ life cycle. Unlike Turkey (and also many CEE countries),
              | Denmark has some of the best ‘packages’ of equality beneﬁts, and its
              | female employment rate nearly matches that of men’s; yet women’s share
              | of academic employment, in particular at professorial level, is well below
              | the European average.
              | The continued hierarchical achievement of women in Turkish academia
              | is under threat at different levels. There is a weakening of the dominant
              | state ideology; greater liberalization in higher education may lead to more
              | ‘ﬂexibility’ and less transparency. Our study indicates the importance of
              | family; however, balancing work and family roles is also contingent on
              | ﬁnancial resources to support help with household and childcare tasks.
              | Family is both a constraint and an enabler; in this there are both
              | commonalities as well as national particularities across Europe.

              | Our study of Turkey is important in the context of the ‘New Europe’,
              | since it demonstrates the importance of state ideology in promoting
              | gender equality. The explanation of Turkish women’s academic success is
              | multilayered and lies in the cumulative and interrelated effect of state
              | policy, institutional transparency, increased labour demand, the
              | home–work interface, and the agency of the professors themselves. This
              | example is, nevertheless, not typical of Turkish women’s labour market
              | experience, and it should be emphasized that this article draws on the
              | experience of a highly educated and privileged elite. This does not negate
              | the importance of their experience; after all, it is such women who are at
              | the centre of debates on vertical segregation in the countries of Europe.
              | The Turkish example suggests that the legislatively focused European
              | approach to equality, which Turkey is now adopting as part of its candi-
              | dacy for EU membership, is necessary, but not sufﬁcient to achieve
              | gender equality.
