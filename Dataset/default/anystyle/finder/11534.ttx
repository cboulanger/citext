              | Abstract
              | The paper examines the degree of conflict and consonance in the editorials of five German
              | quality newspapers between 1994 and 1998. The degree of correspondence in the media
              | system is discussed against the background of Germanýs pluralistic media structure on the
              | one hand and concepts of public opinion on the other hand. Rather than investigating the
              | differential issue selection among the newspapers the analysis compares the opinions on
              | issues correspondingly addressed by several newspapers. It focuses on the newspapers´
              | positions regarding fundamental political conflicts and identifies spheres of consensus and
              | conflict in the media system. Although the newspapers represent distinctly different
              | political orientations each of them also showed issue-specific deviations from its general
              | preference for left or right policy alternatives. Results indicate considerable degrees of
              | consonance regarding external relations issues and education policy. Conflict evolved
              | around law and order and migration issues.
              | Zusammenfassung
              | Das Papier untersucht das Ausmaß von Konflikt und Konsonanz in den Kommentaren der
              | fünf Deutschen Qualitätszeitungen zwischen 1994 und 1998. Der Grad der Übereinstim-
              | mungen wird vor dem Hintergrund der pluralistischen Struktur des Mediensystems einer-
              | seits und Ansätzen zur öffentlichen Meinungsbildung andererseits diskutiert. Nicht die
              | zeitungsspezifisch unterschiedliche Themenauswahl, sondern die unterschiedlichen Mei-
              | nungen, die zu einem von mehreren Zeitungen gleichzeitig ins Spiel gebrachten Thema
              | vertreten werden, stehen im Mittelpunkt des Interesses. Die Analyse vergleicht die Positio-
              | nen, die die Zeitungen zu politischen Grundkonflikten vertreten, und bestimmt Sphären des
              | Konsenses und des Konflikts im Mediensystem. Trotz der unterschiedlichen politischen
              | Grundorientierungen der Zeitungen zeigten sich bei bestimmten Themen jeweils auch Ab-
              | weichungen der Zeitungen von ihrer generellen Präferenz für linke oder rechte Politikal-
              | ternativen. Es ergab sich ein beträchtliches Ausmaß an Konsonanz für Themen aus dem
              | Bereich der internationalen Beziehungen sowie für die Bildungspolitik. Konfliktreicher
              | verlief dagegen der mediale Diskurs zur Rechts- und Ordnungspolitik sowie zu Fragen der
              | Migration.

              | 1. Introduction1
              | The dissemination of information is an undisputed function of the mass media in modern
              | societies. Where a face-to-face exchange of information between all segments of society has
              | become impossible, the mass media mediate information between the audience and the
              | political actors and thus constitute one of the most important subsystems of society. Yet,
              | media in this perspective are frequently attributed a predominantly passive role as they are
              | seen to provide a forum for the exchange of information between a variety of actors without
              | contributing their own view. Restricting the role of the media to their primary function of
              | information dissemination is not only a deficient description of the media but also means
              | distorting and underestimating the legitimate active role of the media in the process of
              | opinion formation. Recent contributions on media performance in modern democracies
              | have drawn attention to the more persuasive and evaluative functions of the media
              | (Gurevitch/Blumler 1990, Page 1996a).
              | The increase in research activity under the heading of „framing“ is a good illustration of
              | the shift towards the persuasive and evaluative dimensions of mass communication. After a
              | period of concentration on the information function of media and cognitive effects scholars
              | have rediscovered attitudes and opinions2. Re-introducing opinion as relevant factor in
              | communication research not only implies a broader perspective on media effects in the
              | audience, it should also modify and differentiate our conceptualization of the media
              | themselves. A systematic incorporation of persuasive and evaluative dimensions directs
              | attention to the media’s political positions and the ways these are communicated. This
              | paper takes the perspective of media as political actors with genuine interests and goals
              | trying to find resonance for their opinions in the audience and the political system. Media
              | do not only act as neutral information agencies providing a forum for other actors but take
              | an active role in the political process by selecting and structuring information, interpreting
              | 1 This paper is a slightly revised version of a paper presented at the Annual Conference of the International
              | Communication Association in Washington D.C. in May 2001. It is part of a larger research project (“Die
              | Stimme der Medien im politischen Prozess: Themen und Meinungen in Pressekommentaren”) funded by
              | the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). It was conducted by Friedhelm Neidhardt, Barbara Pfetsch
              | and the autor at the Social Science Center Berlin.

text          | and evaluating the stream of events continuously taking place and supporting or rejecting
              | particular policy options (Page 1996b, Jarren 1996).
              | Mediás political positions are most openly and legitimately expressed in the opinion
              | sections. Through editorials the media publicly express their opinions and make use of their
              | right to present themselves as autonomous actors. In editorials rather than in the news section
              | the different media outlets establish a particular ideological profile that makes them
              | distinguishable from their competitors and binds certain segments of the audience. By
              | focusing on editorials this paper investigates the particular political positions of the German
              | quality press without regarding its performance in disseminating information. Rather than
              | conceptionalizing the media as collective actor with a uniform political position, the paper
              | sets out to examine the particular constellations of opinion in the media system.
              | Considering the pluralistic structure of the German media system and the distribution of
              | the newspapers across the entire range of the political spectrum there should be a
              | considerable degree of conflict between papers with opposite political positions and
              | divergent party allegiances. Yet, many scholars assume a high level of consonance in
              | media discourse resulting from corresponding professional routines, the homogeneity of
              | class interests, and journalistic co-orientation. The paper discusses the conditions and
              | consequences of consonance and conflict in the media system and relate these to the idea
              | of pluralism and on the one hand and concepts assuming high degrees of consonance in
              | public opinion on the other hand. Applying the position model of party competition to the
              | media system it is investigated to what extent newspapers differ in terms of their particular
              | political positions on particular issues and where spheres of consensus nevertheless develop.
              | The empirical data presented in this paper is derived from a larger project on editorial
              | discourse in the German quality press currently conducted at the Social Science Center
              | Berlin3.
              | 2. Diversity vs. Consonance
              | In modern democracies the mass media maintain and structure the constant exchange of
              | issues and opinions between different actors. Understanding media functions as desirable
              | outputs of subsystems for the greater entity, information, critical observation and
              | orientation are the primary democratic functions the media are expected to fulfil. The
              | neutral dissemination of information between the political elite and the citizens
              | undoubtedly represents the most obvious media function. It has evoked large amounts of
              | research whereas the other media functions have received comparably little attention. The
              | watchdog metaphor refers to the mediás assignment of critically observing the political
              | process and ensuring a certain degree of accountability regarding the political actors. The

meta          | 3
text          | critical observation builds on the information function and applies the idea of freedom of
              | information to the relation between the individual and the state. In order to serve as
              | watchdogs of the political process the media have to be independent of the incumbent
              | authorities. In Germany – like in most modern democracies – effective and collectively
              | binding criticism is assumed to be guaranteed through the structural diversity of the media
              | system. In the print sector and in the privately owned electronic media (as opposed to the
              | public broadcasting system) the idea of pluralism depicts the inter-media-diversity rather
              | than the intra-media-diversity. The individual media outlet is not expected to present a
              | balanced opinion.
              | Orientation representing the last of the three primary democratic media functions has
              | been widely neglected in the scholarly discourse on media performance (Voltmer 1998/99,
              | 14). It explicitly relates to interpretive, evaluative and possibly persuasive media content.
              | The media support the process of opinion formation by critically discussing arguments and
              | making judgements regarding particular policy options, actors´ performances and political
              | decisions. Considering the ever increasing amounts of unconnected information supplied
              | by the media interpretations and evaluative statements that “make some sense” out of those
              | fragments and thereby provide orientation for the audience gain special significance. Since
              | editorials provide „biased information“ they comply with peoplés need for orientation
              | (Weaver 1977) and enable the audience to make political judgements on the basis of
              | limited rationality (Calvert 1985). Hackett suggests to substitute the term “bias” by
              | „structured orientation“ (Hackett 1984, 254). One way of reducing the cognitive effort in
              | opinion formation is relating onés own opinion to the political positions of certain elites
              | who are assumed to have similar attitudes and opinions (Zaller 1992). German quality
              | newspapers also seem to be suited for serving as orientation marks for the opinion
              | formation of the audience because they stand for certain political positions and their
              | readers are divided accordingly4.
              | Like the mediás functions of information and critical observation the orientation
              | function relies on the pluralistic structure of the media system. It is assumed that as long as
              | a pluralistic media structure is guaranteed the media will provide a wide range of facts and
              | opinions needed for independent opinion formation. Only if the media is open towards the
              | variety of societal voices, it can disseminate unbiased, comprehensive and complete
              | information. Only if the media is independent of state, party or economic influence it is
              | able to act as a watchdog supervising the political process. And only if it represents a
              | variety of opinions, it can provide sufficient orientation for the audience and support the
              | audiencés opinion formation. Thus, pluralism may be regarded as the normative basis for
              | a well-functioning democratic media system.

text          | Taking a macro-level perspective on media content means we are not interested in
              | single editorials but in the universe of issues and opinions in the media system. Most
              | investigations of media opinion conceptionalize media as uniform collective actor without
              | differentiating between individual outlets with opposite political positions and divergent
              | party allegiances. Yet, the plurality of voices in the media system has to be considered and
              | special attention has to be directed to the particular constellations of correspondence and
              | divergence among different media outlets. The structural pluralism in the German media
              | system provides for a certain degree of political conflict in the media system. It can be
              | expected that media outlets with a liberal editorial stance hold different opinions than their
              | more conservative counterparts. The differences between media outlets are likely to follow
              | party lines considering that „the same social forces that find expression in the party or
              | parties of a political system tend to find expression also through the press“ (Seymoure-Ure
              | 1974, 159). This leads not only to a parallelism between certain papers and parties but also
              | implies a correspondence between the range of papers and the range of parties.
              | In Germany, the press-party-parallelism is rooted in the tradition of party journalism.
              | Although there is no relevant paper with institutional links to a particular party any more,
              | the party structure is still reflected in today’s press system, especially in the opinion-
              | leading national quality newspapers. Several empirical studies show that German national
              | quality newspapers cover almost the entire political spectrum with the Welt located at the
              | right and the Tageszeitung (taz) at the left of the continuum. Between these poles,
              | beginning from the right and proceeding to the left, there are the Frankfurter Allgemeine
              | (FAZ), the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (FR) (Kepplinger
              | 1985, Hagen 1992, Schönbach 1977, Donsbach/Wolling/Blomberg 1996).
              | In any pluralistic media system different media outlets compete against each other by
              | developing a distinct content profile in order to position and stabilize themselves in the
              | audience market and become distinguishable from other media outlets. Therefore, we
              | expect considerable differences in the ideological positions of the different newspapers.
              | Some structural characteristics of media systems, however, seem to suggest the opposite: the
              | corresponding standardized attention criteria and interpretation strategies, the uniformity of
              | professional and class interests, the media’s observation of each other and their reciprocal co-
              | orientation are likely to produce high levels of correspondence in the media system (Noelle-
              | Neumann 1973, Noelle-Neumann/Mathes 1987, Jarren 1988). In communication research
              | the actual degree of diversity is strongly debated. This also regards the desirable amount of
              | commonality in a modern society. Whereas a pluralistic media structure and high degrees
              | of content diversity has persistently been unquestioned as a presupposition of free opinion
              | formation and a well functioning democracy, recent developments like individualization
              | and the fragmentation of the audience have nurtured the fear of an increasing societal
              | desintegration and lead to a more critical discussion of diversity in the media system. It
              | does not need to be emphasized that a total uniformity between the issues and opinions in
meta          | 5
text          | the media is as dysfunctional as the total lack of mutuality5 (Schulz 1999, Holtz-Bacha
              | 1997).
              | From the perspective of mediás contribution to societal integration high degrees of
              | media correspondence will receive positive evaluations as they give evidence of a
              | minimum degree of common focus in the audience. Integration, however, is not the only
              | outcome of political communication processes requiring high degrees of correspondence.
              | Uniformity in the media system is also appreciated if it seems appropriate to put pressure
              | on the political system to process an issue or react to a particular concern of the public.
              | Media opinion can then be regarded as a substitute of public opinion which becomes a
              | consistent, politically effective and sociologically relevant factor only as a high level of
              | correspondence develops. The concept of public opinion thus more or less explicitly
              | includes the notion of consonance (Gerhards/Neidhardt 1991, Neidhardt 1994, Noelle-
              | Neumann 1982). This point is well illustrated in the spiral-of-silence-approach and related
              | concepts referring to undesirable effects of public opinion.
              | Noelle-Neumann´s concept of the spiral of silence is built on the assumption that highly
              | consonant media content is perceived as majority opinion. This perception generates
              | sufficient social pressure for individuals not to dare expressing divergent opinions in
              | public. As a consequence the impression of the dominant opinion is reinforced and a spiral
              | of silence develops marginalizing opinions that are not sufficiently represented in the
              | media (Noelle-Neumann 1982). She sees the corresponding attention criteria, the political
              | uniformity of the professional peer group, the media’s reciprocal co-orientation as main
              | reasons for the highly consonant media messages. The mainstreaming approach developed
              | by Gerbner and his team (Gerbner/Gross 1976; Gerbner et al.1980, 1992, 1984) is based on
              | very similar assumptions. According to this approach high degrees of consonance in the
              | media establish social norms that more and more individuals adapt to by changing their
              | original attitudes and opinions into the “mainstream” opinion. Gerbner and his team see
              | television as the main unifying factor in modern societies producing high degrees of
              | conformity in peoplés images of the world. The orientation towards large audiences and
              | the elite domination of the media are seen as the main reasons for consonant media
              | content. The dominant tendency is not the aggregate of all the different opinions in society:
              | „Rather, it is the most general, functional and stable mainstream, representing the broadest
              | dimensions of shared meanings and assumptions (...) this mainstream can be thought of as
              | a relative commonality of outlooks and values that heavy exposure to the television world
              | 5 The antagonism between pluralism or diversity and integration is vividly reflected by the contrasting
              | appraisals of any given degree of correspondence in the media system. Depending on the particular
              | reference point high degrees of correspondence are characterized using either positive synonyms like
              | consent, cultural mutuality and harmony or negative synonyms like conformity, adaption, assimilation,
              | uniformity, standardization, stereotyping, collectivism, monopolization, and monologization. Low
              | degrees of correspondences are either positively labelled as diversity and pluralism or devalued as
              | fragmentation, heterogenization, segmentation, dissipation, atomization, specialization, individualization,
              | and polarization (Knoche 1985).

text          | tends to cultivate“ (Gerbner et al. 1994, 286). Both approaches – even though developed
              | with opposite political backgrounds and holding different explanations for the assumed
              | content conformity - view high degrees of consonance in the media as threat to the
              | pluralistic ideal of opinion diversity and as a obstacle to social change.
              | 3. Issues vs. positions
              | Pluralism and press-party-parallelism on the one hand and the assumption of highly
              | uniform media content on the other hand lead to conflicting expectations regarding the
              | degree of correspondence in the media system. In spite of the controversial debates a
              | research tradition investigating the actual degree of consonance in the media has not
              | developed. The empirical efforts to assess the common issue repertoires and opinions in
              | the media system remained few. Except for single-issue comparisons across different
              | media-outlets7 there is basically no information on the general degree of correspondence in
              | the media system.
              | Apart from those empirical shortcomings a theoretical deficit can also be observed.
              | There is no differentiation between issues and opinions issues. In media research high
              | degrees of correspondence are predominantly referred to as consonance. Consonance
              | includes both correspondences of issues and opinions. A terminological differentiation is
              | suggested in order to sharpen the analytical understanding of the construct. Consonance
              | will be used for the evaluative dimension. The degree of correspondence on the issue
              | dimension will be referred to as focusing. Thus, focusing denotes a correspondence of
              | issues, whereas consonance relates to a correspondence of opinion. Regarding the
              | formation of public opinion it is assumed that a low degree of focusing implies a
              | fragmentation of public opinion with highly dissipated issue agendas, whereas a lack of
              | consonance points to considerable conflict between different segments of society. The
              | partisanship might follow the established structures of the party spectrum or develop along
              | the groups and movements not represented in the party system. Correspondingly, the line

              | hegemony which see a unifying effect as a result from elite domination of the media. They structure the
              | ideological field, absorb and domesticate criticism. „Discrepant statements about reality are

text          | system develop regardless of party allegiances - for example in terms of new conflicts
              | between materialism and post-materialism (Fuchs 1991).
              | The differentiation between issues and opinions can be related to two research
              | paradigms, one focusing on the issue dimension, the other one addressing the question of
              | corresponding opinion. The salience model considers issue selection to be the most
              | important aspect of party competition. In this view, it might have a larger impact on the
              | public’s perception of an actor’s ideological position whether or not environmental policy
              | is addressed by a political actor than his or her particular position on concrete policy
              | options. In the salience model the assignment of relevance to an issue is debated in the
              | context of political parties´ strategy to establish an ideological profile and position
              | themselves in relation to competing parties. Scholars supporting the salience model hold
              | that parties do not compete via different positions regarding the same issues. Rather, they
              | selectively emphasize certain issues, presenting them as the most relevant problems on the
              | political agenda. “Left-right competition can consist of attempts to assert the salience of
              | different issues that favor one or the other side” (Budge/Farlie 1985, 288). Applied to the
              | media system, the salience model implies that media outlets with different political
              | affinities present themselves with different issue repertoires rather than different opinions
              | on particular issues. It assumes that different papers will position themselves in the
              | political spectrum by differential relevance assignments. Different editorial positions of
              | media outlets should therefore be reflected by a particular issue selection and presentation
              | rather than through partisan arguments and evaluations. This view stands in sharp contrast
              | to the traditional spatial view of party competition which assumes that parties offer
              | different policy solutions to the same issues.
              | The traditional view, based on Downs´ understanding of party competition, concentrates
              | on the political positions on an issue (Downs 1957). In liberal democracies parties
              | compete for the approval of the electorate by offering certain policies designed to solve
              | particular problems. The concept is based on a rational choice paradigm that assumes that
              | voters after collecting all necessary information choose the policy alternative that comes
              | closest to their individual needs and interests. The salience model contested this paradigm
              | by focusing on issue hierarchies rather than positions on particular issues, but it is an open
              | question whether or not particular issues are clearly linked with certain positions (Voltmer
              | 1998/99, 72). This paper applies the assumptions of the position model of party
              | competition to the German media system. Rather than examining the differential issue
              | selection among the five quality newspapers under study, it investigates the political
              | positions these media outlets hold on certain issues8.
              | Due to the variety of possible positions for any given issue partisanship in the media is
              | frequently assessed in single-issue analyse with a set of issue-specific pro and contra
              | arguments as indicators for media opinion. In order to assess policy preferences across the

text          | entire spectrum of issues, however, a more abstract conceptualization of ideology is
              | needed. Voltmer developed a concept for the analysis of political positions in public
              | discourse that is sufficiently abstract to assess political positions in an all-issue study
              | because it uses general principles of political action (Scarbrough 1984) instead of specific
              | policies. These principles are deductively derived from a classification of areas of political
              | intervention such as the economic and social system, institutional units, social groups,
              | individuals and the transnational surroundings9. The concept reduces the variety of
              | principles regarding one area of intervention to traditionally left, liberal or progressive and
              | traditionally right, conservative and authoritarian alternatives. Positions in this concept
              | thus are bipolar action-oriented alternative means to achieve political goals rather than
              | goals themselves.
              | The concept developed by Voltmer is not only theoretically sophisticated and
              | convincing from an empirical perspective as it clearly differentiates between the
              | ideological positions of different media outlets (Voltmer 1998/99). Using this
              | conceptionalization it is possible to go beyond a general left-right dimension of opinion
              | and investigate the degree of consonance separately for each individual conflict between
              | fundamental alternatives. Regarding the pattern of left and right positions on those
              | conflicts, it can be expected that the profile of a paper with left party allegiances shows
              | more similarities with other liberal than with conservative papers. Also, a conservative
              | paper should resemble the pattern of positions of other conservative papers. It should be
              | interesting, however, to examine which conflicts are nevertheless evaluated
              | correspondingly.
              | 4. Research Design and Operationalization
              | Focusing on editorials the notion of media competition gains special significance since
              | editorials provide an easy means to communicate an outlet’s particular view and address
              | the corresponding segments of the audience. In Germany, editorials do not represent
              | individual views of single journalists, but indicate the editorial stance of a media outlet.
              | Editorials reflect the political views of the papers and serve as a forum of presentation for
              | the mediás genuine view of public affairs. Since the opinion section does not have to
              | comply with the information function of neutral reporting, it can be expected that the
              | different political positions of media outlets become most visible and distinguishable in
              | editorials.
              | Employing a content analysis of editorials in the five German quality newspapers
              | between 1994 and 1998 we investigated the political positions of the individual
              | 9 The principles of action were supplemented with two Germany-specific dimensions regarding the
              | unification process by Voltmer (1998/99).
meta          | 9
text          | newspapers and assessed the degree of consonance among them. All political editorials
              | were included in the analysis, with the exception of editorials on exclusively international
              | news without reference to domestic German politics. The coding unit was the individual
              | article. The analysis is based on a sample of “Die Welt”, “FAZ”, “SZ”, “FR”, and “taz” for
              | two quarters of each year between 1994 and 1998 starting with the second and fourth
              | quarter in the first year, continuing with the first and third quarter in the following year,
              | and switching quarters every other year. The sample was designed to include the coverage
              | in the fall (fourth quarter) of 1994 and 1998 when national elections were held in
              | Germany.
              | In order to assess the political positions of the papers the instrument developed by
              | Voltmer (1998/99) was adapted and slightly modified. The basic conflicts divide into five
              | conflict dimensions. The first dimension, Economic Wealth and Distribution, includes five
              | separate conflicts representing competing – either left or right - views about the adequate
              | means to achieve wealth and just distribution. It includes State Intervention vs. Market
              | Economy, State Responsibility vs. Individual Responsibility, Demand-Side vs. Supply-
              | Side, Tax Increase vs. Tax Reduction, and Regulation vs. Incentives (see appendix for
              | details). The second dimension, Institutional and Individual Autonomy, includes four basic
              | conflicts: Centralism vs. Autonomy, Separation vs. Unification, Need vs. Condition, and
              | Individual Rights vs. State Control. These conflicts relate to liberal or conservative views
              | on the autonomy of subsystems from the greater system. The other three conflict
              | dimensions Cultural Identity, Societal Integration, and External Security each include two
              | basic conflicts. Cultural Identity relates to the relation between “us” and “the others” and
              | includes Cosmopolitanism vs. Ethnocentrism and Cultural Identity vs. Integration. Societal
              | Integration including the conflicts Prevention vs. Sanction and Participation vs.
              | Representation concerns progressive and authoritarian views on integration. External
              | Security including the conflicts Co-operation vs. Conflict and Supra-nationalism vs.
              | Sovereignty refers to the alternatives of co-operative and confrontative principles in
              | international relations. In order to represent conflicts regarding positions toward the “new
              | politics” (ecology, disarmament) for which the conflicts described above do not apply an
              | additional conflict was developed. The left position supports the need to control possible
              | risks from new technologies whereas the right position stands for a preference for risk
              | acceptance (details in the appendix).
              | The sample included 8,717 editorials in five newspapers over five years. For each
              | editorial up to three issues, three basic conflicts and three positions on these conflicts could
              | be coded. The issue coding scheme was composed of 45 fairly abstract issue categories10
              | 10 In the case of our all-issue analysis over five years we were forced to move away from concrete event-
              | type issue categories (restricted by time and space) and define issues on a fairly abstract level. Issues in
              | our coding scheme can be described as policy, politics or polity areas rather than specific controversies.
              | Thus, we differentiate between tax policy and legal system, but not between concrete debates or decisions
              | regarding those issues.
meta          | 10
text          | like specific policy areas (e.g. environment, foreign relations or traffic engineering) and
              | polity as well as politics aspects11 of the political system (like elections, political style or
              | parties and movements). Representing alternative policy options the basic conflicts that
              | could be addressed in commenting on an issue did not apply for issues regarding politics
              | and polity aspects rather than particular policies. Since our consonance measure relies on
              | the newspapers´ positions on these conflicts, only the 15,890 issues regarding policy areas
              | out of the total of 23,160 issues were considered for the purpose of this analysis.
              | For every policy issue addressed in the editorials, the coders had to decide whether or
              | not the commentators referred to one of the 16 basic conflicts in discussing the issue. If
              | one of the conflicts was addressed the issue was considered to be fundamentalized since
              | the underlying political principles were discussed. For these issues they had to decide
              | whether the commentator supported the left or the right position, took an ambivalent stand
              | on the conflict or did not express any specific evaluation at all12. Relating basic conflicts
              | and the positions on these conflicts to particular issues enables us to investigate whether or
              | not an issue is discussed with regard to fundamental policy alternatives and which policy
              | alternative is supported for each issue. We can thus identify a range of conflicts referred to
              | in a fundamental discussion of an issue as well as the respective positions on those issues
              | and get a differentiated multidimensional picture of the opinions expressed in an editorial.
              | If an editorial deals with right wing extremism and migration e.g. the issue might either be
              | related to the conflict prevention vs. sanction or to cosmopolitanism vs. ethnocentrism.
              | Prevention vs. sanction, however, might also represent the relevant conflict in discussing
              | internal security. Whereas a commentator might support the sanction option regarding right
              | wing extremism and migration, he or she might show a preference for the prevention
              | principle in internal security. This illustrates that the political position expressed in an
              | editorial not only depends on the kind of issue, but also varies with the kind of basic
              | conflict the issue is related to. Consonance from this perspective does not only regard the
              | issue and the position on the issue, it also considers the particular conflict addressed.
              | In assessing the degree of consonance between different papers that continuously
              | comment daily politics it is necessary to pay attention to the dimension of time. If a
              | particular paper holds a certain opinion on taxes in 1994 while another paper supports that
              | particular position in 1998, they both display the same opinion regarding tax policy in the
              | aggregate measure of the five years under study. Yet, a correspondence in the strict sense
              | cannot be assumed without regarding the same time period. The two papers might have
              | 11 Politics and polity issues relate to structural and procedural aspects of the political system. They included
              | the following issues: Parties and Movements, Social Order, Principles of Political Action, Political Style,
              | Coalitions, Elections, Parliament and its Members, State and Government, Unification and German
              | Question, and Political Views and Ideologies.
              | 12 If no conflict was addressed with a particular issue, “no reference” was coded. If the conflict was
              | addressed but the commentator did not show support for either side “no evaluation” was coded. Support
              | or rejection of both policy alternatives marked the ambivalent position between left and right principles
              | (see table 1).

text          | expressed their opinions about two distinctly different tax-related events (or maybe even to
              | the same event but at a different time against a different background). Without restricting
              | the comparison between two newspapers to short time periods guaranteeing the same
              | context of current affairs, the validity of the correspondence measure has to be questioned.
              | After all, the notion of corresponding issue selection is based on a shared evaluation of a
              | policy option at a given time. Parallel judgements thus fundamentally involve the same
              | time reference. Corresponding positions can only be assumed if two papers support the
              | same principle of action at the same time.
              | The time reference might be a day – a very strict criterion but meeting the media’s
              | production logic - , but can also be extended to a week thereby leaving enough time for all
              | the papers to develop a position on the issue. This seems to be especially appropriate for
              | events lasting longer than a day. This paper employs weekly measures thereby taking the
              | risk that two evaluations of the same issue refer to two different events in that week.
              | Measures on a daily basis, however, do not tolerate any time lags in coverage, severely
              | reduce the number of cases for comparison and thus make it almost impossible to calculate
              | consonance on a sound empirical basis.
              | The degree of consonance was assessed separately for each issue by comparing the
              | newspapers´ positions on each of the basic conflicts addressed with the issue. Consonance
              | was conceptionalized as negative or inverted dissonance in the media system with the
              | standard deviation between the newspapers´ positions serving as dissonance measure13. A
              | high level of consonance is indicated by a low standard deviation (dissonance), whereas a
              | high standard deviation (dissonance) points to a low level of consonance.
              | 5. Findings
              | The issue frequencies varied considerably indicating differential relevance assignments by
              | the newspapers (table 1). Foreign and European policy, economic policy and taxes
              | received most attention, whereas commercial law, business promotion and infrastructure
              | policy were hardly commented on14.
              | 13 For each paper and issue a mean position - the means of “left”, “ambivalent”, and “right” on the various
              | conflicts addressed with a given issue - had to be calculated. Thus, each paper and issue received a mean
              | position for every conflict that was addressed and the standard deviation was calculated among the
              | newspapers. In order to consider the preference of a newspaper for certain conflicts when discussing a gi-
              | ven issue, the conflict frequencies for each issue were used as a weight in the calculation of the newspa-
              | pers´ mean position on the issue and in the calculation of the standard deviation. This procedure resulted
              | in weighted weekly positions per newspaper and in weighted weekly standard deviations and then avera-
              | ged over the weeks. We are grateful to Christian Galonska who did the data analysis for this article.
              | 14 Since issues in content analyses are categorized according to the specific research question of a project
              | and there is no “natural” category size for reality some issue categories include more cases than others.
              | Foreign policy, e.g. seems to be far more inclusive than business promotion. Yet, as long as we only
              | compare issue frequencies relationally (over time or between newspapers) and do not evaluate the general
              | level of issue diversity, any sort of categorization can be appropriate.

text          | 15 Fundamentalization marks the share all conflict references (“left”, “ambivalent” and “right” positions,
              | “no evaluation”) expressed in addressing an issue out of the total number of issue references. “No
              | reference” marks the share of issue references without addressing one of the basic conflicts.

text          | The differential relevance assignments to particular issues have to be kept in mind when
              | discussing the general position of the newspapers and the degree of consonance for each
              | issue. In this respect, the evaluations concerning foreign and European policy have much
              | more potential to characterize the editorial discourse than the evaluations regarding
              | commercial law or business promotion.
              | In about two thirds of the cases the issues dealt with in the editorials were related to one
              | of the 16 basic conflicts mentioned above. One third of the issues, however, was discussed
              | without reference to those policy alternatives. Instead of fundamentalizing the issue in
              | terms of discussing the underlying political principle, the commentators might have
              | focused on specific details of an event or certain aspects of the issue like the actors´
              | performance, the timing of an announcement or legal or historical aspects. The individual
              | issues showed different degrees of fundamentalization. Highly fundamentalized issues
              | were the social system, business promotion and alliance policy, whereas culture policy,
              | two German states, and defence policy were only rarely related to a basic conflict. It is
              | interesting to note that the most frequently addressed issues were not always the most
              | fundamentalized ones. The degree to which an issue can be related to a basic conflict thus
              | does not make it more suitable for commentary. There is no systematic relation between
              | the attention directed at an issue and the tendency to relate an issue to underlying
              | conflicts16 (Table 1, figure 1). Regarding the opinions expressed in the editorials, the
              | commentators showed a slight preference for the left, liberal or progressive over the right,
              | conservative or authoritarian policy options across all issues (23.4% vs. 20.2%)17.
              | Especially environment, energy, alliance and peace policy received large shares of left
              | evaluations (table 1, figure 1). Yet, some issues – such as taxes and business promotion -
              | were clearly evaluated with a preference for the right. Regarding the mean positions on the
              | basic conflicts addressed in the editorials across all issues, we found considerable
              | differences among the five newspapers under study (figure 2). Results indicate that Welt
              | was located at the right of the left-right scale (2.4 where 1 is left and 3 is right), the FAZ
              | followed closely (2.3). The middle position was taken by the SZ (1.8), and the FR (1.6)
              | and taz marked the left pole (1.6). Considering all newspapers together there was a slight
              | bias to the left side of the scale indicating that the German quality press tended to take a
              | medium to left position on the issues at stake. The newspapers displayed considerable
              | distances from the extreme left and right pole rather than covering the entire political
              | spectrum. The distribution of the papers on the left-right continuum found on the basis of
              | our conceptualization of media opinion confirms former studies based on content analyses
              | as well as expert opinions18.
              | 16 No linear or non-linear correlation was detected between the quantitative significance of an issue and the
              | degree of fundamentalization (tendency of the commentators to relate an issue to a basic conflict). The
              | mean position on the conflicts did not correlate with the issue frequency either.
              | 17 In roughly 15% of the cases they did not indicate any preferences, and for 7.5% of the issues they
              | supported both views expressing an ambivalent position.

text          | Since the positions expressed when addressing individual issues refer to particular basic
              | conflicts, we can get a detailed picture about the newspapers´ positions on 16 pairs of
              | policy alternatives. Breaking down the political positions of the newspapers into the
              | individual conflicts addressed, we found distinct profiles for each paper regarding their
              | particular focus of concern (table 2). The left spectrum supported larger shares of left,
              | liberal and progressive positions in almost every basic conflict whereas the conservative
              | press supported larger shares of right, conservative and authoritarian positions (table 2,
              | figure 3). Since the newspapers did not always follow their general ideological position on
              | the left-right scale in every conflict, however, we identified conflicts with a tendency
              | towards left and conflicts with a tendency towards right evaluations. The papers clearly
              | tended to lean towards the left in Co-operation vs. Conflict, Supra-nationalism vs.
              | Sovereignty conflict, State vs. Individual Responsibility, Participation vs. Representation,
              | Cosmopolitanism vs. Ethnocentrism, and Control vs. Acceptance of Risk. A right
              | partisanship was displayed in the conflicts Tax Increase vs. Reduction, Separation vs.
              | Unification, and Prevention vs. Sanction (table 2, figure 3).
              | The conservative Welt and the FAZ took a liberal stand on the two international politics
              | conflicts, the left wing taz and FR in turn expressed right positions regarding the questions
              | of unification. The typically centrist SZ went with the right spectrum in conflicts related to
              | economy and taxes (State Intervention vs. Market Economy, Demand-Side vs. Supply-
              | Side, Tax Increase vs. Tax Reduction), and – like all the papers – on Centralism vs.
              | Autonomy. In sum, no paper exclusively held either left or right positions. A clear
              | cleavage, however, was found between the Welt and FAZ on the one hand and the SZ, FR
              | and taz on the other hand. Only in conflicts regarding economic matters the SZ deviates
              | from the left-wing papers21.
              | Although the ideological profiles of the newspapers already indicate a certain degree of
              | conflict in the media system, they do not render statements about the parallel evaluations
              | of the five newspapers at a given point in time. A systematic consideration of the time
              | dimension lead to a conceptualization of consonance on the basis of weekly comparisons
              | of the newspapers´ positions for each individual issue. Considering the issue-specific
              | average positions of the newspapers across the weeks, we found that social, environmental,
              | peace, and alliance policy and European policy tended to receive high shares of left
              | evaluations (table 3). German unification, monetary, and tax policy, on the other hand,
              | were evaluated more conservatively. As already noted with regard to the newspaper
              | profiles on the basic conflicts, for some of the issues the newspapers deviated from their
              | 21 Disregarding the conflicts and examining the newspapers´ positions with respect to the issues we found
              | almost the same pattern of differences between the papers (without table). Left papers were likely to
              | express left positions on most of the issues (but not on all of them) and right papers showed higher shares
              | of right positions on most issues (but not on all of them).

text          | general ideological position on the left-right scale. In the area of federalism, alliance and
              | foreign policy the conservative newspapers even held more liberal positions than the
              | liberal papers22.
              | Comparing the newspapers´ positions on the issues for each individual week, we found
              | the highest degree of consonance for commercial law, budgetary policy and alliance
              | policy23. The least consonant evaluations were received by federalism, social order and
              | culture policy (table 3). Still, with respect to the low quantitative significance of an issue
              | (table 1) we cannot predict high degrees of societal unrest related to the issues of
              | federalism and social system or either identify broad spheres of consensus in society on the
              | basis of consonant evaluations of commercial law, budgetary and alliance policy. Conflict
              | or consonance in the area of international politics, economy, taxes, labour and employment
              | and right-wing radicalism and migration are likely to be much more relevant as these
              | issues better reflect the character of editorial discourse.
              | The most consonant and most dissonant issues did not attract much editorial attention.
              | Yet, there is no systematic relation between the issue frequencies and the level of opinion
              | correspondences among the newspapers24. Editorial attention does not depend on the
              | degree of conflict or consonance in the media system. With respect to the absolute
              | significance of certain issues in editorial discourse, our discussion of the degree of
              | consonance among the newspapers will concentrate on the issues most frequently
              | addressed by the commentators. Within those frequently addressed issues foreign and
              | European policy and education policy displayed comparably high degrees of consonance,
              | whereas internal security, legal policy and right wing extremism and migration showed
              | low degrees of consonance. Moderate degrees of consonance were found for economic
              | policy, taxes, labour and employment, the legal system and industrial relations policy.
              | Editorial discourse between 1994 to 1998 can thus be characterized by a broad coalition
              | among the newspapers regarding external affairs and educational matters, while issues
              | related to law and order and migration issues were discussed highly controversial.
              | 22 Certain characteristics of the events taking place in the time period under study might explain these
              | unexpected results. During the Bosnian crisis the German left was reluctant to comply with the
              | expectations of the other NATO-members who wanted a stronger military engagement of Germany and
              | more co-operation with the NATO. Regarding this problem the left papers put forward a more isolationist
              | view which affected their position on the conflict Co-operation vs. Conflict. The evaluation of the
              | federalism issue was dominated by problems connected with the integration of the former East-German
              | states. Here, the left papers supported their autonomy, usually a more conservative position.
              | 23 The degree of consonance per issue was derived from the weighted consonance measures for each basic
              | conflict addressed with the issue. For details of the weighting procedure see footnote 13.
              | 24 Neither linear nor non-linear correlations could be detected.

              | with references to Co-operation vs. Conflict and Supra-nationalism vs. Sovereignty with an

              | with reference to the conflicts Prevention vs. Sanction and Individual Rights vs. State

              | related to one main conflict only and showed low levels of consonance. Commentators on
              | education policy showed a slight tendency to support the right position in the conflict
              | Centralism vs. Autonomy. Regarding the tax issue they showed a strong support for the

              | 6. Summary and Discussion
              | The analysis examined the political positions of five German quality newspapers on policy
              | issues addressed in their editorials. Employing a content analytical instrument that
              | conceptionalized positions as abstract preferences for fundamental alternatives of political
              | action it was possible to assess the ideological profiles of the newspapers in terms of left or
              | right partisanship regarding 16 basic conflicts and identify spheres of conflict and
              | consensus in editorial discourse. The general political positions of the papers confirmed
              | former studies of the German newspaper spectrum with the FAZ and Welt located on the
              | right hand side of the scale, the FR and taz located on the left, and the SZ taking the middle
              | position.
              | Although we found clear cut cleavages between left and right newspapers the
              | evaluations by the commentators did not always follow the newspapers´ general
              | ideological position on all the issues and with regard to all the conflicts. That means the
              | positions expressed by the newspapers varied considerably across the issues. Especially
meta          | 22
text          | issues regarding external relations, some aspects of the social question, and environment
              | can be regarded as issues with a tendency for left partisanship. Most economic and
              | financial matters as well as German unification, on the other hand, seemed to be
              | predominantly discussed from a conservative perspective. For some issues the ideological
              | positions of the newspapers even contradicted our expectations. A left bias regarding
              | international politics displayed by the conservative papers was paralleled by a right bias on
              | questions of German unification that was shown by the liberal newspapers.
              | In sum, liberal and conservative papers displayed surprisingly corresponding positions
              | on some issues, while they strongly disagreed on others. Regarding the most frequently
              | addressed issues only external relations and education were commented on with
              | comparably consonant positions while most other issues - especially legal matters and
              | migration - were controversially debated. The results represent strong evidence for the
              | position model of left-right competition. Newspapers with opposite political positions take
              | conflicting positions on given issues. Since there was only limited parallel issue selection
              | in any given week, however, the consonance could only be assessed for few issues in few
              | weeks. Even without separately testing the salience model29, the difficulties calculating the
              | consonance measure with only few weeks of parallel issue selections already indicates that
              | newspapers do in fact differ in terms of relevance assignment. They do not routinely
              | address the same issues in a given week but rather emphasize certain issues that their
              | competitors do not assign relevance to. Thus, the salience model is not at all rejected by
              | our results. Instead, both models seem to apply. Newspapers compete through differential
              | relevance assignment but also hold different positions on the issues that nevertheless are
              | correspondingly addressed.
              | As there is no normative optimum of consonance and conflict in the media, we can only
              | speculate on the implications of our findings for the pluralistic ideal on the one hand and
              | the integration potential of media on the other hand. The relatively low degrees of
              | consonance detected in this analysis, however, do not seem to represent a severe danger to
              | democracy and do not point to a completely mainstreamed media opinion. As some issues
              | still marked consensual spheres there is no evidence of a general cleavage between the left
              | and right newspaper spectrum pointing to a high level of desintegration.
              | Regarding the question of differential relevance assignment to particular issues, our
              | findings disappointed some common expectations. There is no causal relationship between
              | the quantitative relevance of an issue and the degree of conflict or consonance: Issues
              | discussed highly controversial among the five newspapers do not necessarily attract much
              | editorial attention in a given week. Even though conflict between certain actors has proved
              | to be a highly efficient news factor, the degree of conflict between different newspapers
              | 29 The salience model was tested in a previous article (see Eilders 2000).
meta          | 23
text          | does not result in high levels of media attention. Neither are highly consensual issues likely
              | to be addressed more frequently. We found no evidence that the media in their editorials
              | direct attention to consonant issues calling to mind the spheres of consensus in society and
              | thereby enhancing integration. As fundamentalization and the mean position of an issue
              | have not prooved to be good predictors for media attention either, it seems to depend on
              | certain inherent characteristics of issues and concrete political events rather than on the
              | media opinion and the constellations of opinion in the media system whether or not an
              | issue receives editorial attention.

text          | APPENDIX: Definition of conflicts
              | The State Intervention vs. Market Economy Dimension
              | This dimension refers to the relation of the state and the economic subsystem. It centers
              | around the question to what extent the state should intervene in economic processes. One
              | answer to the question emphasizes the importance of the market, the other answer stresses
              | state intervention.
              | State intervention:
              | The emphasis is on state intervention and the creation of a mixed economy is called for.
              | Uncontrolled market forces are assumed to end in imbalances with unintended economic as
              | well as social consequences. Therefore, state intervention in economic processes is
              | considered necessary. Sometimes, the state itself becomes an economic entrepreneur.
              | Market economy:
              | The emphasis is on market forces. It is assumed that the market is capable of structuring
              | the economic and social conditions of economic processes effectively. Economic activity
              | of the state is considered ineffective. Thus, state intervention is rejected and the
              | privatization of state enterprises is encouraged.
              | The State Responsibility vs. Individual Responsibility Dimension
              | This dimension refers to different principles of responsibility in the relationship between
              | state and society. The question is who is responsible for evening out social inequalities.
              | Answers to this question are of particular importance for welfare policies. Individual
              | responsibility and state responsibility are distinguished as policy positions.
              | State responsibility:
              | The emphasis is on the responsibility of the state or collective agencies to provide goods
              | and services to even out social inequalities and fulfil individual needs. The assignment of
              | state responsibility is usually associated with a tendency to institutionalize social rights.
              | Individual responsibility:
              | This principle is often referred to as the subsidiary principle (Subsidiaritätsprinzip). It
              | emphasizes the responsibility of the individual or social groups and social organizations
              | (e.g. family, neighbourhood, churches) for all tasks they can reasonably take upon
              | themselves. Only if the solution of a problem exceeds the resources of the individual or
              | social group, higher level groups or organizations and finally the state are supposed to act.
              | The principle of individual responsibility is usually associated with a political tendency to
              | cut back government activity in society.
              | The Demand-Side vs. Supply-Side Dimension
              | This dimension refers to monetary and fiscal policies of the state. The question is in which
              | direction state intervention into income distribution has to be done. A supply-side position
              | and a demand-side position are distinguished.
              | Demand-side orientation:
              | The goal is on supporting consumers (private households) in the market process. It is
              | assumed that strengthening the "effective demand" will result in a stronger supply-side.
meta          | 29
text          | Demand-side oriented policies center on measures to increase private income, e.g. by
              | programs for employment and improving workforce quality. All welfare aid that improves
              | income (e.g. unemployment benefits, child allowances) can also be regarded as elements of
              | demand-side oriented policies.
              | Supply-side orientation:
              | The goal is on supporting investment activities of private economic actors. It is assumed
              | that in the first place the supply-side should be supported. As a result, consumers would
              | also be strengthened. Supply-side oriented policies focus on the improvement of conditions
              | for private enterprises. Main instruments are the reduction of taxes, wages, and
              | entrepreneurial risks.
              | The Tax Increase vs. Tax Reduction Dimension
              | This dimension refers to the resources of the government budget. The question is to what
              | extent the state should burden the economy and private incomes in order to fulfil its tasks.
              | This conflict was sharpened by the challenges resulting from the reconstruction of East
              | Germany after unification.
              | Tax increase:
              | The state is regarded as responsible for a wide variety of public - tasks which necessarily
              | require extensive financial resources. Besides the classical tasks of the state like the
              | guarantee of internal and external security, other tasks such as welfare, education and
              | infrastructure are also seen as in the scope of its responsibility.
              | Tax reduction:
              | The scope of state tasks is defined restrictively. The state should confine itself to the
              | classical tasks, while goals like education, infrastructure and parts of welfare are assigned
              | to private organisations. High taxes are considered as an obstruction of economic growth
              | and private initiative, resulting in inflation and unemployment.
              | The Regulation vs. Incentives Dimension
              | This dimension refers to the political instruments aimed to influence economic or social
              | behavior, especially in the areas of labour market and environmental protection, which
              | create enormous deficits and where the means of problem-solving are highly disputed. The
              | policy positions here are regulation and incentives.
              | Regulation:
              | A particular behavior is regulated by binding norms. The typical instrument of regulation is
              | the law.
              | Incentives:
              | A particular behaviour is encouraged by the state by providing incentives. This policy
              | position relies on economic incentives to bring about a desired behaviour (rewards) and on
              | economic disincentives to block undesirable behaviour (duties). It is up to the individual to
              | observe incentives or disincentives or to accept the consequences.
meta          | 30
text          | The Centralism vs. Autonomy Dimension
              | This dimension points to different conceptions of how the relationship between the central
              | state and its diverse sub-units should be organized. In particular, it applies to federalism
              | and the degree of autonomy cultural organizations, such as mass media and churches, or
              | economic organizations, such as employers and trade unions, should have. The positions of
              | autonomy and centralism are distinguished.
              | Centralism:
              | The emphasis is on the strengthening and expansion of the central state's rights and power
              | with respect to the smaller sub-units. This policy position accords the central state a
              | dominant role. The central state pursues this goal by making use of his main resources,
              | Legislation and distribution of money.
              | Autonomy:
              | The emphasis is on the smaller units' rights and autonomy with respect to the central state
              | or the role of the federal government. The autonomy position stresses that sub-units should
              | act on the basis of their own resources and their own decision making.
              | The Separation vs. Unification Dimension
              | This dimension refers to the relation between the two parts of Germany, especially after
              | the breakdown of socialism. The dimension refers not only to inter-state relations, but also
              | to the relation between organizations (interest groups, parties) that then existed in both
              | parts of the country.
              | Separation:
              | The (partial) autonomy of the two parts of Germany and its institutions is stressed. The
              | goal is a confederation of the two German states, at least the persistence of East German
              | institutions. Sometimes the demand is merely to postpone national or institutional
              | unification.
              | Unification:
              | The national unity is regarded as the highly valued and preferred structure. Unification at
              | all levels is demanded as fast as possible. The persistence of institutions of the former
              | GDR is rejected.
              | The Need vs. Condition Dimension
              | This dimension refers to how the differences in terms of wealth and power between East
              | and West Germany can be reduced. The alternatives indicate different modes of the
              | transfer of resources from the West to the East.
              | Need:
              | The transfer of resources is defined by the needs of East Germany. Money, manpower and
              | know-how are transferred. A further demand is to share political power. The support by the
              | West is considered as a matter of national solidarity.
              | Condition:
              | Support and transfer are only given when certain conditions the reconstruction of
              | institutions and the implementation of market economy, are met. In particular, political
              | power is only shared when the East German politicians have proved their integrity.
meta          | 31
text          | The Individual Rights vs. State Control Dimension
              | This dimension points to the tension between individual and society. The problem is how
              | to ensure the cohesion of the society which is made up of many individuals. One answer to
              | this problem stresses individual rights, the other emphasizes state control.
              | Individual Rights:
              | This position assumes that the individual is able to choose the "right way" without
              | endangering the rights of other individuals and the interests of the community. The
              | individual should get the chance for self-determination. The individual has to be protected
              | from the state and social pressure for conformity. The individual is regarded as responsible
              | and rational.
              | State control:
              | The assumption is that the pursuit of individual rights and interests tends to violate the
              | common interest. Thus, the individual has to fit into society and has to accept customs,
              | norms, rules, duties and his or her particular role, even if this would run counter one's own
              | needs and goals.
              | The Cosmopolitanism vs. Ethnocentrism Dimension
              | This dimension refers to the relationship to foreign cultures and ethnic groups outside the
              | society. It also captures the degree to which the own culture and the own people should be
              | favoured in domestic legislation. Ethnocentrism and cosmopolitanism are distinguished as
              | policy positions.
              | Cosmopolitanism:
              | The emphasis is on the equal value of different cultures and nations ("opening"). This
              | policy position rests on universalistic values and pluralism. Possibilities of immigration are
              | regarded liberally.
              | Ethnocentrism:
              | The emphasis is on the superiority and priority of the own culture and nation ("closure").
              | The ethnocentrist position draws from the conviction that one's own culture and norms are
              | of more value than others. But even without such an evaluation, one makes a clear
              | distinction between one's own group and foreign groups. Possibilities of immigration are
              | interpreted restrictively.
              | The Cultural Identity vs. Integration Dimension
              | This dimension refers to how to handle culturally and ethnically different groups in the
              | society. Should groups be encouraged to keep their cultural identity (multiculturalism) or
              | should they be encouraged to assimilate? In this context, in Germany, problems have
              | arisen, particularly with the guest-workers. Presently, it has gained new importance with
              | the opening of the borders, both within the EC and with the Eastern countries. Further, it
              | refers to the situation in the reunified Germany where people with different experiences,
              | values, styles of life and economic conditions live together.
              | Cultural identity:
              | The emphasis is on the originality, identity and the specific rights of different cultures and
              | ethnic groups living together. Cultural identity means that culturally different groups live
meta          | 32
text          | together in a community, but each wants and is granted to preserve its own cultural
              | particularities. The diversity of culturally and ethnically different groups is considered to
              | be a valuable addition for societal life. This might also find its expression in rights and
              | institutions.
              | Integration:
              | The emphasis is on the necessity of cultural adaptation and integration into the dominant
              | culture in order to make living together possible. Integration takes place culturally
              | (adaptation to values, styles of life, language), socially (similarity of socio-economic
              | conditions), and formally (legislation). Integration is regarded as a precondition for full
              | participation in political, economic and social affairs of the host culture.
              | The Prevention vs. Sanction Dimension
              | This dimension refers to the question of which instruments should be used to prevent
              | deviant behaviour (e.g. crime) and to guarantee law and order. The main policy area of this
              | dimension is penal Legislation and law enforcement. The positions of sanction and
              | prevention are distinguished.
              | Prevention:
              | This policy position emphasizes preventive measures to counteract deviant behaviour.
              | There is the conviction that circumstances can be altered in a way to prevent deviant or
              | criminal behaviour. The solution to deviant behaviour is seen in changing societal
              | conditions. Thus, ultimately the society is responsible for a successful socialization.
              | Sanction:
              | The emphasis is on authoritative acts to punish deviant behaviour. The functions of
              | punishment arc both atonement and deterrence. It is assumed that deviant behaviour can be
              | controlled by threat of punishment. Thus, higher crime rates are usually responded to by
              | heavier sanctions.
              | The Participation vs. Representation Dimension
              | This dimension refers to the relationship between the citizen and the political system. The
              | question is to what extent the citizens should participate in political decisions. The policy
              | positions on this dimension are representation and participation.
              | Participation:
              | The emphasis is on the right of the citizen to participate and have a direct say in ongoing
              | policy decisions. The underlying principle is an extensive model of democracy. The goal is
              | to extend the possibilities and the modes of participation. Beyond voting in elections,
              | direct modes of participation, such as referenda and plebiscites, are approved. Further,
              | democratic participation should include as many areas of society as possible (e.g.
              | economy, community planning). The extension of participation rights to segments of the
              | population that did not have these rights before (e.g. blacks, guest-workers) is also part of
              | this dimension.
              | Representation:
              | The emphasis is on representative democratic procedures which imply an indirect
              | participation of citizens in political decision making. Instead, the role and the functions of
              | the elected representatives are stressed. The underlying principle is a procedural model of
meta          | 33
text          | democracy. According to this concept, citizen participation should be mainly restricted to
              | voting, i.e. establishing government majorities. After this, binding decisions are taken by
              | the elected representatives.
              | The Co-operation vs. Conflict Dimension
              | This dimension refers to general principles of international relations. It covers bilateral
              | foreign politics as well as the two main international conflicts, namely the East-West
              | conflict and the North-South conflict. We distinguish two policy positions, conflict and co-
              | operation.
              | Co-operation:
              | The state emphasizes shared interests and joint action with other states. With respect to the
              | East-West conflict, policies of detente and co-operation are pursued. Strategies are arms
              | reduction or action according to CSCE-procedures. With respect to the North-South
              | conflict, the necessity of solidarity and international responsibility is being stressed.
              | Conflict:
              | The state emphasizes its own national interests and puts these interests first. In the pursuit
              | of its goals it accepts conflict with other states as a means of politics. Confrontation is a
              | characteristic state of the Cold War.
              | The Supra-nationalism vs. Sovereignty Dimension
              | This dimension refers to the specific way relations to other states arc to be organized. It
              | centers on the question of whether and to what extent sovereign rights should be delegated
              | to supranational or international organizations. The most important organizations for the
              | current process of internationalization are the UNO, the NATO, and the EC. The respective
              | positions are labelled sovereignty and supra-nationalism.
              | Supra-nationalism:
              | The necessity of international and supranational organizations is emphasized. The state is
              | ready to delegate rights from the nation-state to supranational organizations. The rights of
              | supranational organizations should be expanded and strenghthened.
              | Sovereignty:
              | The state insists on sovereign rights and endeavours to maintain the structures of a nation-
              | state. There is a resistance to the delegate of rights to supranational organizations, a
              | tendency to restrain the power of these organizations, or slow down the process of
              | internationalization.
              | New: The Control of New Technologies vs. Acceptance of Risk Dimension
              | This dimension refers to the conflict regarding “new politics” that mostly evolves around
              | environmental and human biology issues. It centers on the question how the technological
              | development should be organized and whether and to what extent possible negative
              | outcomes of new technologies should be accepted or whether the state should be more
              | sceptical toward new developments. The respective positions are labelled Control of New
              | Technologies vs. Acceptance of Risk Dimension.

              | aus dem Ausland werden gebeten, für jedes bestellte Arbeitspapier einen „Coupon-
              | Réponse International“ (Internationaler Antwortschein), der auf Postämtern erhältlich ist,
              | beizufügen.
              | Aus diesem Grund ist es auch nicht mehr möglich, Bestellungen von Arbeitspapieren per
              | Telefon oder Fax an das WZB zu richten. Schicken Sie Ihre Bestellungen nur noch
              | schriftlich an die WZB-Pressestelle, und legen Sie neben der entsprechenden Anzahl von
              | Briefmarken weiterhin einen mit Ihrer eigenen Adresse versehenen Aufkleber bei. Die in
              | letzter Zeit erheblich gestiegene Anzahl von Bestellungen sowie die Mittelkürzungen, die
              | öffentlich finanzierten Institutionen – wie auch dem WZB – auferlegt wurden, machen
              | diese Maßnahme unumgänglich. Wir bitten um Verständnis und darum, unbedingt wie
              | beschrieben zu verfahren.

              | Stamps for Papers
              | We ask for a 1 DM-postage stamp per paper from all those who wish to order WZB-papers
              | and who live in Germany. These stamps contribute to the shipments costs incurred. All
              | persons interested in WZB-papers from abroad are kindly requested to send one “Coupon-
              | Réponse International” (international reply coupon) for each ordered paper. The coupons
              | can be obtained at your local post office.
              | The reasons for these measures are the high increase in the number of ordered papers
              | during the last months as well as the cut in funds imposed on publicly financed institutions
              | like the WZB. We do ask for your understanding and hope that you will comply with the
              | above mentioned procedure.
