              | Demography
              | The relevance of the study lies in the acu-
              | te need to modernise the tools for a more
              | accurate and comparable reflection of the de-
              | mographic reality of spatial objects of diffe-
              | rent scales. This article aims to test the me-
              | thods of “demographic rankings” developed
              | by Yermakov and Shmakov. The method is
              | based on the principles of indirect standardi-
              | sation of the major demographic coefficients
              | relative to the age structure.
              | The article describes the first attempt to
              | apply the method to the analysis of birth and
              | mortality rates in 1995 and 2010 for 140
              | countries against the global average, and for
              | the Baltic Sea states against the European
              | average. The grouping of countries and the
              | analysis of changes over the given period
              | confirmed a number of demographic develop-
              | ment trends and the persistence of wide terri-
              | torial disparities in major indicators. The
              | authors identify opposite trends in ranking
              | based on the standardised birth (country con-
              | solidation at the level of averaged values)
              | and mortality (polarisation) rates. The features
              | of demographic process development in the
              | Baltic regions states are described against the
              | global and European background.
              | The study confirmed the validity of the
              | demographic ranking method, which can be
              | instrumental in solving not only scientific but
              | also practical tasks, including those in the
              | field of demographic and social policy.

              | Introduction
              | Demographic development of count-
              | ries and regions of contemporary world is
              | hugely inconsistent. This can be explai-
              | ned by the increasing globalisation and
              | democratisation of international exchan-
              | ge of human and intellectual resources,
              | on the one hand, and by the aspiration to
              | preserve the independence of elites and
              | ensure the reproduction of the “nation”,
              | D. Ivanov, N. Sluka
              | on the other hand. The inconsistencies are further aggravated by such global
              | trends as population ageing, declining birth rate, transformation of family
              | traditions, and a general decline in the natural increase rate. These circum-
              | stances emphasise the need for an accurate, timely, and comprehensive as-
              | sessment of the demographic situation in certain countries and regions of the
              | world and possible trends in its short-term development and long-term fore-
              | casting. At the same time, traditional demographic indicators do not always
              | meet the objective of reflecting global, regional, and country-specific demo-
              | graphic processes. Traditional demographic rates (for instance, birth and mor-
              | tality rates) — although not influenced by the absolute population size — are
              | affected by numerous structural factors, including the sex structure, ur-
              | ban/rural population structure, marriage structure, etc. However, one of the
              | key factors affecting the development trends and the level of other demogra-
              | phic rates is the age structure of population [1; 5—7].
              | Age Structure in Demographic Assessment
              | The significance of age structure for the demographic situation can be
              | demonstrated through a comparison of countries that differ considerably in
              | the level of socioeconomic development, for instance, Poland and Sweden.
              | In 2010, according to the UN, the former had a mortality rate of 9.8 ‰, the
              | latter of 10.2 ‰. These rates seem to be comparable. However, the paradox
              | is that the age specific mortality rates are greater in Poland then in Sweden
              | almost in all age groups (see table 1). The reason behind it is the methodo-
              | logy of calculating the mortality rate that uses total population as its deno-
              | minator. However, it is not homogenous, in particular, in terms of the age
              | structure; and different age groups show different mortality rates. Population
              | aged 0—14 accounted for 14.8 % in Poland and 15 % in Sweden, that aged
              | 15—64—71.7 and 65.5 % respectively, that above 65—13.5 and 19.5 % res-
              | pectively [12]. In other words, the age structure of population has a major ef-
              | fect on the mortality rate, which does not give a comprehensive picture of
              | the qualitative estimation of mortality.

              | Standardisation of Demographic Rates and Demographic Forecasting
              | Methods that make it possible to mitigate the distortion caused by stru-
              | ctural factors, first of all, the age structure, have already been developed.
              | One of the ways to navigate around the problem is to use specific rates that
              | are slightly or not at all affected by structural factors. The other way is to
              | standardize demographic coefficients. Such standardization is usually based
              | on factoring overall rates. These factors reflect, on the one hand, the in-
              | tensity (level) of the demographic process and, on the other hand, the size or
              | percentage of the given subpopulation in total population [1]. The essence of
              | standardisation is that the actual overall rates are compared against the in-
              | dicators describing a certain conditional population (real or artificially crea-
              | ted), whose demographic process intensity or structure is used as a bench-
              | mark. The efficiency of chosen methods — direct, indirect or reverse stan-
              | dardisation — depends on what is taken as a benchmark.
              | For the purpose of this study, we will turn to indirect standardisation,
              | which has been widely used for analysing the mortality and — more recently —
              | birth rate. Statistically, it is based on the age structures of real population as
              | the benchmark, as well as the age-specific indicators of the demographic
              | process intensity in standard population. In other words, the age-specific ra-
              | tes are re-weighted against the age structure of the real population. As a re-
              | sult, it was possible to project a number of events that would take place in
              | standard population if its age structure were identical to that of real
              | population. The correlation between the number of demographic events in
              | real population with and the expected number is expressed by the indirect
              | standardisation index. The product of the overall standard rate and the index
              | is the standardised overall rate, which expresses the probable level of the
              | overall rate in real population given the age-specific intensity of demogra-
              | phic processes is similar to those in standard population. It is expressed by
              | the following formula:
              |  Р1х  m1x
              | Iind  х
              |  Рх1  mx0 ,
              | х

              | where Iind is the indirect standardisation index; Р1х the age structure of rela-
              | tion population expressed in absolute terms; m1x is the age specific indicators
              | of the demographic process in standard population; mx0 the age-specific indi-
              | cators of the demographic process in the given population.
              | When using standardised rates, one should not forget that they do not
              | have an independent value, because they depend on the chosen benchmark.
              | Therefore, application of standardised coefficients and corresponding rates
              | and rankings is limited to comparing different populations under the con-
              | dition that the standardisation was conducted using the same method and
              | benchmark. At the same time, the benchmark should be a population “samp-
              | le”, whose demographic (first of all, age) structure is close, although not si-
              | milar, to the age structures of the compared populations.
              | This work presents the first attempt to develop a ranking [2—4; 8; 9] ba-
              | sed on the standardised correlation of the birth and mortality rate for almost
              | 140 countries against the global average and for the Baltic region against the
              | European average. The study uses the official UN data and the resources of
              | the World Bank as of 1995 and 2010 [10—12]. The general formula for cal-
              | culating the average birth rate (standardised birth rate correlation — SBRC)
              | is as follows [2; 8]:
              | SBRCk = SUMk/Σi (AIBi · POPki),
              | (2)
              | where k is the number of a country, i the number of an age group, SBRCk the
              | value of standardised birth rate correlation for the kth territory; SUMk is the
              | total annual number of births on the kth territory; AIBi the age-specific inci-
              | dence (age-specific birth rate in women of the ith age group), POPki the ave-
              | rage annual size of the ith age group of female population for the kth country.
              | The numerator in formula (2) is the actual annual number of births in the
              | kth country, whereas the denominator is the hypothetical number of births in
              | the kth country if the age-specific birth rates in women of different ages on
              | this territory equal the corresponding indicator for a population of a higher
              | level.
              | Similarly, one can calculate the standard mortality rate correlation
              | (SMRCk) — a ratio of the number of deaths in the kth country to the hypo-
              | thetical number of deaths under the conditions that the age specific mortality
              | rates in the country coincide with the global age-specific mortality rates [9].
              | The formula is as follows:
              | SMRCk = DEk/Σi (AIDi · PPki).
              | In other words, it is a comparison of the same process that is taking place
              | within two populations — the real and hypothetical ones. The hypothetical
              | population is the real population of a country characterised by the global
              | average mortality rate. The ratio of the actual (DEk) to the hypothetical num-
              | ber of deaths in the kth country is such as if the mortality rate in each age
              | group i were at the global average: Σi (AIDi × × PPki). In the denominator of
              | formula (3), AIDi is the age-specific global incidence (per 1,000 population)
              | in the ith age group; PPki is the average annual size of the ith age group in the
              | kth country. Therefore the denominator totals the results for each age group
              | (3)

              | (5 year age groups correspond to the UN classification), which imparts the
              | SMRC additional depth and, therefore, reduces the effect of internal structu-
              | ral characteristics on the final result.
              | The 1995 and 2010 SBRC and SMRC-based Ranking of Countries
              | and the Position of the Baltic Region
              | The global SBRC and SMRC-based ranking is presented in tables 2 and 3.
              | Our calculations allow to identify seven distinct groups in both cases. As to
              | the SBRC, in all countries of group one (a SBRC of 0.5 and lower), the birth
              | rate would be twice or more as high if the age-specific incidence of the pro-
              | cess were at the global average. However, the sixth (SBRC of 1.5—2.0) and
              | seventh (SBRC of above 2.0) groups, whose core is predictably formed by
              | African countries at the early stage of demographic transitions, are characte-
              | rised by values that significantly exceed the standard. In case of the SMRC,
              | the first group (SMRC of 0.5 and lower) brings together countries that show
              | a mortality rate significantly below the global average, whereas the sixth and
              | the sevenths groups are comprised by countries (SMRC of 1.5—2.0 and abo-
              | ve 2.0), whose rates considerably exceed the global average.
              | The development of BRC and SMRC-based rankings using an original
              | methodology [2—4; 8; 9] for two selected years, and their comparison, make
              | it possible to identify the key trends, work with different scales, and conduct
              | analysis at different territorial levels — those of individual countries, re-
              | gions, and the entire world. The first attempt of a study from the global pers-
              | pective resulted in a number of interesting observations and preliminary
              | conclusions, in particular, those based on the data of a final table of ranking
              | changes (table 4).
              | There are a number of general conclusions that we can make from
              | studying the data presented above. One, the world of demography remains
              | highly differentiated, and the range of indicator values is very wide. Two,
              | spatial distribution of indicators corresponds to the global centre-periphery
              | model, whose conditional core is the African region with the extraordinary
              | high both birth and mortality rates and the periphery the more developed
              | countries characterised, as a rule, by rather low rates. Three, global trends of
              | decline in the birth and mortality rates exhibit different intensity on different
              | territories. Moreover, there are numerous examples of reverse and rather
              | stable trends not only at the national, but also regional levels. Four, the
              | median group of countries is poorly represented in all SMRC and SBRC-
              | based rankings (10—17 %), which is indicative of certain illusoriness of
              | global average values and requires adjustment in each individual case. Five,
              | the 1995—2010 SBRC ranking structure is characterised by a process of
              | smoothing the peak, extreme values, whereas an increasing number of
              | countries consolidated within the range of the global average. If, in 1995, the
              | third — fifth groups accounted for less than 37 % of all countries, in 2010,
              | the accounted for 50 %. Sixthly, the development of the SMRC ranking
              | structure over the same period is characterised by a process of polarisation,

text          | Calculation based on tables 2 and 3.
              | In 1995, the Baltic region states formed a rather consolidated cluster in
              | the SBRC ranking — they comprised the first two groups with a significant
              | but unfulfilled potential. Over the following years, a pronounced divergence
              | between them emerged. Without going into detail (it is a subject for a sepa-
              | rate study), one can state that, against the global demographic background,
              | only Poland demonstrates a stable downward trends as to the birth rate and
              | only Germany is characterised by “negative stability”. The other countries
              | improved their situation as compared to the global average by 2010.
              | As to the SMRC, the overall trends in the regional development are po-
              | sitive. The position of only two countries deteriorated of the period — Rus-
              | sia moved down one position to group five and Lithuania to group four. Lat-
              | via remained in the fourth group, whereas the other six Baltic region states
              | experience a “demographic transition” that accompanied the positive trend.
              | Today, with the exception of Poland and Estonia, they are in the group of
              | countries with the lowest mortality rate in the world.
              | The Baltic Region States in European Rankings
              | For a number of reasons, European countries have traditionally shown a
              | low birth rate (SBRC < 1) at the global level, however, the situation is not
              | homogenous. Against this background, in 1995, the Baltic region states
              | comprised a rather coherent group with relatively favourable characteristics
              | (tables 5, 6).

              | In almost all countries, the SBRC was around 1.3, which means an
              | increased age-specific incidence of births against the European average
              | standard. However, the following period saw a steep decline in the SBRC,
              | although it did not occur at the same pace. As of 2010, Denmark retained its
              | position in the ranking followed by Sweden and Finland. This situation is a
              | result of a number of factors, which include high standard of living and a
              | consistent policy aimed at increasing the birth rate pursued since the 1970s.
              | Probably, a certain contribution is made by a large influx of migrants (in

              | Sweden, they account for 15—19 % of population according to different
              | estimates) that exhibit increased fertility (often, of more than three children
              | per woman of reproductive age). Four countries of the region — Estonia,
              | Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia — are approximately at the European average,
              | whereas Germany (despite the high standards of living and a large influx of
              | migrates) and Poland are characterised by a gradual decrease in the birth rate
              | since the mid-1990s.
              | The analysis shows that, in and around 1995, the mortality rate was the
              | leading differentiating factor of the demographic situation in the Baltic re-
              | gion states. While in the SBRC the countries show similar results, in the
              | SMRC they are divided into two equal groups. The rates of the first group
              | are below the European average standard (Sweden, Finland, Germany, and
              | Denmark), those of the second group are above that (Poland, the Baltics, and
              | Russia). Over the next 15 years, the situation remained stable. The compo-
              | sition of the first group and the values of the SMRC did not significantly
              | change, however, Denmark improved its position and topped the ranking.
              | The trends characteristic of the second group of countries are more ambi-
              | guous. For instance, Poland and, notably, Estonia reached the European ave-
              | rage in terms of SMRC and occupied a central position in the Baltic region
              | ranking against the background of a decrease in the age-specific incidence.
              | An opposite trend is observed in Lithuania and Russia. The latter’s rate
              | (1.53, sic!) emphasises the acuteness and depth of the demographic crisis
              | caused, according to experts, by a combination of numerous factors of demo-
              | economic, socioeconomic, sociomedical, and socio-ethical nature.
              | Conclusion
              | The search for new tools of a more accurate and effective assessment of
              | the demographic situation in individual countries and regions made it
              | possible to discover a unified approach to developing demographic rankings
              | (designed for and tested on Russian regions using the data of official Russian
              | statistics) in the works of S. P. Ermakov and N. A. Shmakov [2—4; 8; 9].
              | Standardised birth and mortality rates minimise the significance of structural
              | differences in the population of different territories. Therefore, it becomes
              | possible to make comparisons at any level — from the global to municipal
              | one. The first attempt to apply the method to long-term international
              | statistical data proved its validity and applicability to the studies in the field.
              | Notable conclusions regarding the nature of certain development trends in
              | the birth and mortality rates in both the global and macroregional context
              | were achieved. New experimental data were obtained and the features of
              | development of demographic processes in the Baltic region were identified.
              | At the same time, the results obtained require further investigation, detailed
              | interpretation, and an in-depth analysis, also that at the level of individual
              | countries and regions. Moreover, the “pure” data on the condition of popula-
              | tion and demographic processes seems to be important for all relevant autho-
              | rities. This information can be used in the formulation and targeted imple-
              | mentation of both demographic and social policies.
