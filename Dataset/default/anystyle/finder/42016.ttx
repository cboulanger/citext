              | (RatSWD)
              | The RatSWD Working Papers series was launched at the end of 2007. Since 2009, the series
              | has been publishing exclusively conceptual and historical works dealing with the organization
              | of the German statistical infrastructure and research infrastructure in the social, behavioral,
              | and economic sciences. Papers that have appeared in the series deal primarily with the
              | organization of Germany’s official statistical system, government agency research, and
              | academic research infrastructure, as well as directly with the work of the RatSWD. Papers
              | addressing the aforementioned topics in other countries as well as supranational aspects are
              | particularly welcome.
              | RatSWD Working Papers are non-exclusive, which means that there is nothing to prevent you
              | from publishing your work in another venue as well: all papers can and should also appear in
              | professionally, institutionally, and locally specialized journals. The RatSWD Working Papers
              | are not available in bookstores but can be ordered online through the RatSWD.
              | In order to make the series more accessible to readers not fluent in German, the English section of
              | the RatSWD Working Papers website presents only those papers published in English, while the
              | the German section lists the complete contents of all issues in the series in chronological order.
              | Starting in 2009, some of the empirical research papers that originally appeared in the
              | RatSWD Working Papers series will be published in the series RatSWD Research Notes.
              | The views expressed in the RatSWD Working Papers are exclusively the opinions of their
              | authors and not those of the RatSWD.

              | Abstract
              | Despite the obvious existence of civil society organizations (CSOs) and forms of
              | civic engagement, the data available for this sector remains inadequate. This expert
              | report provides a comprehensive view of the current data situation, reveals existing
              | gaps, and offers suggestions on how these gaps might be closed.
              | The empirical material currently provided by existing data sources - the Federal
              | Statistical Office, statistics from the CSOs themselves, as well as special data and
              | surveys - only register this area separately and to a limited extent, and even then
              | not in a consistent manner. With respect to both civil society organizations and
              | forms of individual engagement there is an inadequate data situation. Questions
              | that have arisen around whether CSOs will remain oriented toward civil society in
              | a context of increased economic pressure on organizations cannot be answered.
              | Similarly, it is nearly impossible to analyze whether civic engagement belies an
              | increased tendency towards monetarization.
              | Since civil society will undoubtedly continue to gain in political and social
              | importance, the long-term task will be to set up a meaningful and a predominantly
              | self-contained system of data collection and provision. This goal can be reached by
              | following up on the existing surveys and databases described in this paper.

              | Introduction
              | The term “civil society” attracts a range of paraphrases and definitions. One of the most
              | common definitions is action-oriented and focuses on four distinct attributes (Kocka 2003;
              | Gosewinkel et al. 2004, 11). These attributes include (1) qualities of self-organization and
              | independence; (2) an emphasis on actions taken in the public domain nurturing exchange,
              | discourse, and understanding but also conflict; (3) the acknowledgement that conflicts and
              | protests are included in this concept of civil society but they are associated with peaceful,
              | non-violent, and non-military actions; and (4) a course of action that considers the common
              | good above and beyond individual, specific, and particular interests.
              | This paper conceives of civil society in accordance with the logic of this field. As such,
              | civil society can be perceived especially as characterized by (a) the self-organization of
              | citizens and (b) their voluntary engagement in a number of organizational forms, such as
              | clubs, associations, initiatives, or foundations. These organizations are generally regarded as
              | the institutional core or infrastructure of civil society and are often collectively referred to as
              | the “third” or “nonprofit” sector as a way of separating them from state and market sectors
              | (Anheier et al. 2000). Civil society organizations (CSOs) thus constitute that area of society
              | located between the boundaries of market, state, and family, and are characterized by their
              | formal structures, organizational independence from state control, autonomous administration,
              | non-profit approach, and voluntary engagement. Engagement in civil society organizations
              | includes both unpaid voluntary work in traditional membership-based organizations and
              | nonprofit-oriented activities in unconventional forms of organization.
              | CSOs can be found in a variety of areas and perform diverse roles. Whether in recreational
              | or cultural spheres, as part of social service facilities, or as other types of local, professional,
              | and political advocacy groups (e.g., clubs, associations, foundations, not-for-profit PLCs,
              | cooperatives, etc.), they have collectively become an essential part of society’s workings.
              | As contemporary forms of civic self-organization and self-responsibility, CSOs possesses
              | considerable abilities with regard to the concentration, expression, and representation of
              | interests. They are assigned responsibility for implementing important tasks in promoting the
              | development of democracy, providing welfare state services, as well as integrating citizens
              | into coherent collectivities and thereby ensuring social cohesion.
              | A number of factors have led to the increased importance of this sector of society in recent
              | years. On the one hand, citizens have progressively taken greater charge of their own skills.
meta          | 2
text          | On the other hand, social change has led to changes in social roles and functions, resulting in
              | an increasingly stark division of tasks between state, market, and civil society. The growing
              | significance of CSOs has manifest itself through increases in the number of CSOs, in the
              | number people working in them, and in the services they offer. At the same time, the number
              | of voluntary workers also continues to grow.
              | Despite the obvious existence of CSOs and forms of civic engagement, the data available
              | for this sector remains inadequate. Due to the relatively late development of this social sector
              | as an independent scientific discipline, the empirical information available on this constantly
              | evolving sector is incomplete. Even official statistics and other data-providing information
              | systems only mark this area separately to a limited extent, even then not in a consistent
              | manner. For instance, CSOs and their services are often subsumed within the categories of
              | state and economy, with data gathered from disparate surveys seldom taking their autonomous
              | forms of organization into account.
              | CSOs tend to point out the fact that they break down the classic dichotomy of state and
              | citizen, replacing it with the three social spheres of state, market, and civil society. In the past,
              | however, the autonomy of this sector did not prevent the use of CSOs for political ends in
              | order to carry out those inconvenient tasks for which no one was - or considered themselves
              | to be - responsible. With this in mind, some social actors view CSOs as simply a form of
              | cheap “repair service,” a way of balancing out the social deficits caused by the failure of the
              | market, state, or family sectors.
              | Generally speaking, the growing demand for data on civil society can be explained by the
              | increasingly autonomous significance of civil society in economic, social, and cultural life.
              | Yet the current data situation is extremely complicated, not least because civil society has its
              | own particular logic of action, and possesses unique functions and organizational structures,
              | all of which have until now received only a modicum of direct attention and consideration.
              | Data is lacking on the size of this sector, the extent of the services it offers, and its degree of
              | socio-political integration. Current yet differentiated information is needed in order to more
              | accurately define the significance of civil society, its development, and its contribution to
              | providing solutions for current and future social challenges.
              | This expert report provides a comprehensive view of the current data situation, reveals
              | existing gaps, and offers suggestions on how these gaps might be closed. Whereas in
              | Germany relatively little data on civil society is available, other countries, such as the USA,
              | Australia, Italy, Belgium, and even Hungary, have progressed much further with regard to
meta          | 3

              | an important component of these countries’ official statistics.

              | The Current Data Situation in the Civil Society Sector
              | Empirical research on civil society can be divided into investigations aimed at three distinct
              | levels. At the macro level, CSOs are collectively analyzed as a field or sector. At the meso
              | level, research focuses on the CSOs, their specific tasks, and the way they function. Finally, at
              | the micro level, public activity in and for these organizations is investigated, with the key
              | words in this context being membership, volunteering and donation behavior.
              | A considerable step toward improving the relatively awkward data situation in the past
              | took place with the Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project,1 a large-scale,
              | internationally comparative project with a scope spanning more than thirty countries. Under
              | the coordination of the Johns Hopkins University Institute for Policy Studies (Baltimore,
              | USA), this project provided the results of data collected in Germany for the 1990 and 1995
              | reporting periods. The project was launched in 1990, and encompassed a group of seven
              | industrialized and five developing countries. In the meantime, the number of countries taking
              | part has increased significantly. During the second phase (1995–1999), countries in North and
              | South America, as well as both Western and Eastern Europe were heavily represented.
              | Existing gaps in Africa and Asia have also been closed in more recent years thanks to the
              | provision of additional country reports. Germany has been involved in the project from its

              | nonprofit sector, and investigates qualitatively how the sector is embedded within national
              | structures. During the second phase, the German component of the project was located at the

              | The Johns Hopkins Project also developed a corresponding methodology, thereby establishing
              | the essential groundwork for and facilitating the establishment of a long-term observation. In
              | collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University Center for Civil Society Studies, the United
              | Nations Statistics Division produced the Handbook on Nonprofit Institutions in the System of
              | National Accounts. This publication offers recommendations and guidelines for setting up
              | national information systems. A host of countries (including Belgium, Italy, and France,
              | among other European countries) have already adopted this approach. In Germany, however,
              | no similar administrative decisions and practical steps have been taken. Nevertheless, the
              | implementation of this methodology is both conceivable and indeed can be achieved, thanks
              | to the close cooperation between the research community, the Federal Statistical Office, and
meta          | 5
text          | the CSOs.
              | In order to establish a long-term and sustained observation of civil society in Germany,
              | data from official statistics as well as additional data stocks from CSOs, federal ministries,
              | and other institutions and associations - including the research community - must be
              | integrated. Despite endeavours to secure the continuous generation of reliable data on the
              | social impact and performance of civil society in Germany, up to this point only partial and
              | very basic data have been made available. And yet, it would be possible to draw from these
              | diverse sources - official statistics, information from the CSOs and, above all, data from
              | scientific surveys. It is critical that the current data situation be fundamentally reshaped and
              | improved; this must be set as a goal for the future. Greater coordination will be required in
              | order to coordinate the amalgamation of the various data stocks. Moreover, scientific
              | research, especially with regard to CSOs, must be undertaken. The current situation for the
              | individual fields is as follows:
              | 2.1
              | The Federal Statistical Office
              | The Federal Statistical Office provides diverse statistics, although they do not fully conform
              | to the methodology laid out in the Handbook on Nonprofit Institutions in the System of
              | National Accounts. The information gathered from this source during the investigation
              | referred to the number of CSOs, the number of staff, the CSO’s financial volume, as well as
              | the services offered, results, and capacities. These data do not, however, offer a full picture of
              | the CSOs. Some of the surveys used to collect data are based on the 2003 German
              | Classification of Economic Activities (WZ03) and use a type of business entity classifications
              | that are not consistent with the typical fields of activity and type of business entity
              | classification developed by the Johns Hopkins project. Thus, the significance of these data is,
              | generally speaking, limited. The following summarizes the individual data and data sources
              | pertaining to CSOs within official statistics:
              | a) Economic accounts
              | - Data on gross value added and staff
              | b) Business register

              | Income tax statistics

              | - Data on finance volume (income acquired through donations and the expenditure
              | of donations; profit and loss information)
              | d) Survey on private schools (no current data available—last surveyed in 1995)
              | - Data on the number, income, and expenditure of private schools
              | e) University statistics (manual allocation of type of business entity necessary)
              | - Data on the number of universities, their staff, expenditure, income, and services
              | provided

              | Statistics from Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)
              | Data received from umbrella organizations represent another important source of information
              | for statistical analyses. However, the material provided from these sources is marked by
              | certain gaps and irregularities. These gaps are caused by a number of factors. On the one
              | hand, transparency is not particularly well developed in civil service organizations; the
              | corresponding tax legislation means that only limited support is received from the state. On
              | the other hand, the member organizations of these umbrella organizations - or even their
              | regional branches at the level of the Länder - are themselves autonomous and independent
              | legal entities and thus not obliged to provide data. Finally, incapability and noncompliance
              | inevitably lead to gaps and loss of information.

text          | At this point, it is useful to make the following observation: when one considers the
              | combined statistics available within all non-statutory welfare services in Germany (i.e., the
              | voluntary welfare organizations of Caritas, Diakonie, the German Red Cross, Paratätische,
              | and the Central Welfare Office of Jews in Germany), the combined statistical data in all the
              | museums in Germany, and the database of the German Association of Foundations
              | (Bundesverband Deutscher Stiftungen), it is very clear that CSOs could play a much larger
              | role as potential suppliers of data in the future. The information gathered during the individual
              | surveys of the CSOs refers to the number of CSOs, the services offered and capacities, as well
              | as the number of staff.

              | 2.3 Special Data and Surveys Focusing a Micro Level
              | a) The Volunteers Survey
              | The German Volunteers Survey consists of a representative data collection in which around
              | 15,000 German citizens over the age of 14 are queried about their level of civic engagement.
              | To date, the survey has been carried out twice - in 1999 and 2004 respectively. The next
              | survey is planned for 2009. The survey’s data - which have been scientifically verified -
              | provides a number of opportunities for carrying out extensive analysis on the orientation,
              | extent, and potential of civic engagement in Germany. At the same time, the survey provides
              | information on the willingness of individuals to participate in civic activities (cf. Gensicke et
              | al. 2006). Furthermore, the survey offers insight into the motives behind civic engagement
              | and the social structure of volunteerism. The data was collected differentially according to
              | socio-structural criteria.
              | b) The German Socio-Economic Panel
              | By focusing on “social participation and time use,” the German Socio-Economic Panel
              | represents another crucial source of data in the combined statistical measurement of
              | engagement in civil society. Data from this source focuses on the types of engagement
              | associated with certain forms of CSOs. At the same time, activities that fall within the
meta          | 8
text          | purview of informal personal and community networks are also taken into account. Although
              | the data gathered is not differentiated by specific fields of engagement, it is well-suited to the
              | illustration of general trends and developments over time, and can also be used to implement
              | time series analyses and analyses on socio-structural factors.
              | c) The IAB Establishment Panel Survey
              | Data from the IAB Establishment Panel is primarily evaluated at the Institute for Employment
              | Research (IAB: Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung). The survey gathers data from
              | organizations that have at least one staff member subject to social insurance contributions.
              | Therefore, the sample only contains those CSOs with paid staff. The survey thus provides
              | information relating to staff and the CSOs. However, because it concentrates on economically
              | active establishments, the broader spectrum of CSOs remains poorly represented.
              | d) European Social Survey
              | The European Social Survey (ESS) is a representative social survey established at the
              | suggestion of the European Science Foundation (ESF) and carried out for the first time in
              | 2002/2003. In the first round, twenty-two countries participated (Belgium, Denmark,
              | Germany, Finland, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxemburg, the
              | Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, Slovenia, Spain, the
              | Czech Republic, and Hungary). With the exception of Switzerland and the Czech Republic,
              | data on engagement in civil society was provided for the remaining twenty countries. The
              | long-term goal of the ESS is to investigate the interaction among political and economic
              | institutions in transition, as well as the attitudes, convictions, and behavioral patterns of each
              | country’s population. The first round focused on the themes, “Citizenship, Involvement,
              | Democracy.” The 2002/2003 survey uses a four-step approach to gather data on civic
              | engagement, including: (a) being a member of a CSO, (b) working for a CSO, (c) donation
              | behavior, and (d) civic engagement within a CSO. He likens civil society within ten European
              | countries (cf. Deth et al. 2007).
              | 3.
              | Gaps, Progress, Developments, and Tendencies of the Current Data Situation
              | This portrayal of the current data situation makes it abundantly clear that a comprehensive
              | and developed information system on civil society simply does not exist at this point. While
              | individual engagement can be analyzed through different scientific surveys other areas show
              | distinct deficits. Data gaps exist particularly where it concerns CSOs and their concrete fields
meta          | 9
text          | of activity. To date, the current picture - including over 600,000 associations, more than
              | 14,000 foundations, around 8,000 registered cooperatives, and numerous other organizations -
              | is more than a little hazy. Information on newly established or disbanded CSOs can, as a rule,
              | only be found by searching through special registers existing for different forms of
              | organizations. One particularly significant gap are broader scientific surveys covering all
              | different organizational forms of CSO.; other countries (e.g., Austria) have already embraced
              | this approach in recent years as part of their federal statistics. These offer insight into the
              | dynamic changes in the orientation and activities of different CSOs. In view of the increased
              | economic pressure on organizations, which then tend to react by improving management or
              | by tapping into additional financial resources (e.g., donations), this has become a necessary
              | step. This simultaneously raises the question of whether CSOs intend to remain oriented
              | toward civil society. A change in this direction could lead CSOs to regard the engagement of
              | the population in civil society as less important. Economic factors can therefore lead to the
              | neglect of civic engagement and volunteerism on the part of the CSOs.
              | Moreover, irrespective of all that might be done at the organizational level, many
              | questions that concern the civic engagement sector at the individual level remain unanswered:
              | either no data are available or existing data cannot come up with adequate answers. As a
              | consequence, it is almost impossible to analyze whether civic engagement belies an increased
              | tendency towards monetarization. This would confirm theories which talk of increased
              | tendencies towards a dissolution of boundaries vis-à-vis gainful activity. Research is also
              | needed to ascertain whether an element of value change is taking place relative to civic
              | engagement and whether forms of a stronger, non-organized engagement, one which requires
              | no concrete membership, are becoming increasingly prevalent.
              | Alongside these obviously significant gaps in the data, however, some developments and
              | tendencies can be detected that point to improved data collection and analysis.
              | a) Civil Society Data Collection Project
              | Due to the grossly inadequate data situation that exists with regard to civil society, several
              | foundations have decided to sponsor a new intervention. The aim of this project, which will
              | run until 2010, is to establish a reporting system based predominantly on the Federal
              | Statistical Office’s data stocks. The reports will focus on providing an economic balance sheet
              | and social service profile for CSOs. The project is located at the Stifterverband
              | Wissenschaftsstatistik GmbH, the research and development branch of the Donors’
              | Association for Promotion of Science and the Humanities in Germany, and will provide basic
              | data for further investigations. Based on the concepts and methods of the Johns Hopkins
meta          | 10
text          | Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project, with existing international standards that have
              | developed in the meantime, the midterm goal of the project is to establish a national
              | accounting satellite system.
              | b) Report on Donation Behavior
              | So far there have been a number of investigations that deal with donation behavior. Among
              | these we find the “Donations Survey” (Spendenmonitor) by EMNID and the “Gfk
              | Charity*Scope” survey of the GfK Group, an international market research company.
              | Amidst calls for greater transparency in the donation sector and increasing competition
              | among nonprofit organizations, plans are underway to publish a national report on donation
              | behavior. The Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB: Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für
              | Sozialforschung) has developed the report methodology which contains, among others,
              | information on donation volume, donors, purposes, and motives. The project can be
              | implemented by the German Central Institute for Social Issues (DZI: Deutsches
              | Zentralinstitut für soziale Fragen).
              | 4.
              | Future Requirements and Perspectives for Civil Society Data
              | Civil society will undoubtedly continue to gain in political and social importance as we move
              | into the future. It is highly likely therefore that the demand for data and analyses will also
              | increase. The long-term task, as it has been in many other areas of society, will be to set up a
              | meaningful and predominantly self-contained data collection and provision system. This goal
              | can be reached by using the existing surveys and databases that have been described in this
              | paper. Along with more substantial and better methods of coordination, the criteria and
              | categories for civil society must be integrated into other data collection activities.
              | Considerable progress could be made by ensuring that the type of business entity represented
              | by CSOs, or their nonprofit orientation, is considered as a specific criterion throughout. The
              | basis for subsequent analysis can also be strengthened by integrating questions about civic
              | engagement into other specific large-scale surveys (e.g., the annual microcensus). The
              | experience in Austria has shown that using this approach significantly improves the
              | availability and quality of data.
              | More effort must be directed toward carrying out larger surveys on CSOs. The impact of
              | research in this field and the evaluation of particular structures and practices will have
              | increasing significance.
