              | Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDAS
              | Diógenes Carvajal
              | Abstract: Nowadays we have a wide variety of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis
              | software, CAQDAS, to choose from, and almost every qualitative researcher uses one or two of
              | these programs to analyse his/her data. This demand for CAQDAS has brought not only more
              | sophistication in the newest programs and updates but also the discussion about its methodological
              | implications and the need for more training courses and workshops. A lot has been written about
              | the relation between CAQDAS and qualitative methodology. Nevertheless, the ways the training
              | courses and workshops have been developed and carried out have not been outlined. Who are
              | these courses planned for? Is there any prerequisite that the attendants must fulfil? What must the
              | main goal of these training courses be? This article discusses some facts I have found in my
              | experience as a social researcher and CAQDAS user and trainer in a country where this kind of
              | software is not widespread. The article also focuses on some of the problems that arise when train-
              | ing people in the use of CAQDAS and the consequences the globalisation of training courses and
              | workshops focused on the acquisition of mechanical code-and-retrieve skills have for qualitative
              | methodology. Finally, I propose some critical issues that CAQDAS trainers and qualitative
              | researchers should bear in mind when teaching or learning the use of any qualitative data analysis
              | software.

              | 1. Introduction
              | Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software, CAQDAS, are very
              | common among qualitative researchers nowadays. The first programmes were
              | created in the 60s, but it was in the 80s and early 90s when they began to be
              | widely recognised in the field of qualitative analysis. Today the use of software to
              | assist qualitative analysts is a must, and there is a wide range of programmes to
              | choose from, each one including specific tools for the handling and storage of
              | different qualitative data. Some of them can work only with text, others can
              | handle images, sound and video; some build hierarchical trees of categories,
              | others let the researcher build their own "trees", and others simply list the
              | categories alphabetically. Most of them can create reports according to the
              | analyst's needs; some can be used as a first step in the analysis of data, and the
              | results can be exported to other programmes for further analysis. Although the
              | tools the programmes offer have revolutionised the way of doing qualitative
              | analysis, there are still qualitative researchers who systematise their data
              | manually in a reliable way. [1]
              | Together with the increase of the use of these programmes, many workshops to
              | train researchers in the use of them have been developed. Some workshops are
              | led by universities and research centres, and others are provided by private
              | enterprises. Some are offered to small groups of researchers, others are offered
              | to anyone who wants to learn to use these programmes. But most of them are
              | one-day or two-day training workshops, which guarantee participants that they
              | will acquire the adequate skills to use a specific software in their own qualitative
              | projects. [2]
              | The most well known programmes are the code-based theory-builders (MILES &
              | WIETZMAN, 1995), and most of the workshops offer training in the use of one of
              | these programmes. I have trained some qualitative researchers interested in
              | knowing CAQDAS, and some quantitative researchers who simply wanted to
              | know the way a text analysis software works, but kept on using SPSS. Although
              | software to assist qualitative data analysis is almost unknown in Colombia (or
              | perhaps because of it), my brief experience as CAQDAS user and trainer has
              | made me wonder: Are we on the right track offering one-day or two-day training
              | workshops? And, even more important, are we on the right track when separating

              | the workshops from the academic discussion about the methodological
              | implications that the use of CAQDAS brings? I do not have all the possible
              | answers to these questions, but my particular experience shows some ways to
              | re-think most of the current training workshops. [3]
              | 2. Training Workshops: Between Neophilia and Usefulness
              | 2.1 The demand for training workshops
              | The use of CAQDAS is rapidly growing among qualitative researchers. This has
              | implied the creation of many workshops round the world to train people in the use
              | of the software. Some programme developers travel widely to lead one-day or
              | two-day workshops, which are now highly appreciated in many countries, such as
              | the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. These workshops are open
              | to anyone who wants to be trained in the use of a programme; being a qualitative
              | researcher is no prerequisite. [4]
              | The demand for workshops is focused on two programmes: Atlas.ti and NUD.IST.
              | I think that this is due to two main reasons: (1) these are the most well known
              | programmes world-wide; and (2) most of the novice qualitative researchers who
              | want to use a CAQDAS ask more experienced researchers for the "best"
              | programme, and most of the time they are referred to Atlas.ti and NUD.IST. [5]
              | This phenomenon has been strongly criticised. Not because of the programmes
              | themselves, but because they are based on the Grounded Theory Methodology.
              | COFFEY, HOLBROOK and ATKINSON (1996) say that the wide spread use of
              | software developed around Grounded Theory, would lead us to the
              | homogenisation of all the qualitative analysis processes; i.e. we all would become
              | grounded theorists. [6]
              | LONKILA (1995) suggests that the fact is that some aspects of Grounded Theory
              | have been overemphasised, especially the process of coding. In other words,
              | some of the qualitative researchers are using Grounded Theory because the
              | software they use is based on this methodology. The advantages and
              | disadvantages that this may bring have been long discussed (see also LEE &
              | FIELDING, 1996). My own experience has shown me that that is causing
              | prejudicial effects in the qualitative research field, something that I had already
              | mentioned in a previous article (CARVAJAL, 2001). But there is another fact to
              | bear in mind: some qualitative researchers use CAQDAS because these
              | programmes are fashionable. [7]
              | I have found that some researchers prefer Atlas.ti or NUD.IST based on aspects
              | like the user-friendliness and the interface, instead of the fact that the
              | programmes are useful to their methodology. Once a qualitative researcher asked
              | me about the "best" programme of all (this is the first question CAQDAS users
              | ask); I told her that there was no "best" programme, but that based on the data
              | and methodology of her research, I could suggest her one. After some interchange
              | of emails, she decided to buy NUD.IST Vivo because it was the latest version

              | FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:
              | The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDAS
              | available in the market, and because its interface was more attractive. It is not
              | that a programme must not have an attractive interface; but the decision to use
              | one or the other must be made from the basis of the methodology the researcher
              | is going to use. Buying a CAQDAS is like buying a tie: you will look for a tie that
              | matches the suit you are going to wear. [8]
              | 2.2 What people believe and expect from CAQDAS
              | As I said before, in Colombia the software to assist qualitative analysis is almost
              | unknown; because of this, most of the people I have trained had no previous
              | knowledge about CAQDAS. When I asked what they expected from this software,
              | the answer was very simple: "to use the programme to analyse our data". This is
              | the first misunderstanding about CAQDAS that trainers must fight. No
              | programme can analyse data. They can help the analyst to organise the
              | documents, categorise them and facilitate the processes of searching documents
              | and categories. But the process of interpreting and building results from the
              | categories and the relations among them is up to us. We must do the analysis
              | (DEY, 1993). [9]
              | The possibility of reducing the time of analysis by using a programme is also one
              | of the expectations that novice CAQDAS users have. If we compare the process
              | of computer-assisted analysis to the traditional cut and paste, the amount of time
              | will be significantly reduced. But the time of analysis depends not only on the fact
              | of using a CAQDAS or not, but also on the amount of data that is going to be
              | analysed, the type of analysis the researcher is going to do and the expertise of
              | the researcher in the use of the software. Novice users, especially those who
              | have no background in qualitative research and methods, must realise that
              | qualitative analyses imply longer time than quantitative analyses do. Using a
              | CAQDAS is not like inputting data in a spreadsheet and pressing OK to obtain
              | results. It implies a long process of reading, segmenting and categorising the
              | data. And, finally, if the researcher wants, he/she can also search among his/her
              | documents and categories, formulate hypothesis and test them just before
              | building his/her conclusions. [10]
              | A last expectation novice users have is related to the results of the research.
              | Novice users are interested in the way the programme can help them to write the
              | final report of their research. That is, how the outputs can be integrated into the
              | final report. The outputs (results of searches, reports on categories, diagrams,
              | etc.) have different formats, depending on the software used. Most of the
              | programmes generate outputs that can be exported as ASCII or ANSI files (text-
              | only documents), and then can be edited using a word processor. No qualitative
              | programme generates outputs that can be directly included as a part of the report
              | of a research. Once again, it is the researcher who has to write his/her
              | conclusions in the final report. [11]
              | These expectations, understandable in the context of researchers that have no
              | previous knowledge of CAQDAS, represent a quantitative approach to the use of

              | The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDAS
              | computers in qualitative analysis. Some researchers expect the programme to anal-
              | yse their data in the same way some quantitative programmes like SPSS do. [12]
              | 2.3 Characteristics of current training workshops: more tools than
              | reflection
              | Through the mailing list QUAL-Software, created by the CAQDAS Networking
              | Project, I regularly receive information about CAQDAS workshops led by
              | universities, the CAQDAS Networking Project itself, and private enterprises. I will
              | refer here only to the workshops that were planned to be held between
              | September 2001 and April 2002. Ironically, I will use a quantitative approach to
              | show the frequency of the main characteristics of these workshops. [13]
              | There were 44 planned CAQDAS workshops, divided as follows: fourteen on
              | NUD.IST Vivo; nine on Atlas.ti; eight on NUD.IST 5; four on NUD.IST 4, as well
              | as on Decision Explorer and winMAX, and one on The Ethnograph. 29 out of 44
              | workshops were one-day sessions; 14 were two-day sessions, and one was a
              | three-day session. The last one was a special case because it followed a two-day
              | course on Handling Qualitative Data. 43 out of 44 workshops were introductory
              | ones. There was only a one-day workshop for advanced users. All of the 44
              | workshops were hands-on, and in seven of them, participants were invited to
              | bring their own data. Only three workshops specified the maximum number of
              | participants (5, 10 and 20 respectively). [14]
              | In addition to the CAQDAS workshops, there were a few other courses on
              | CAQDAS related topics, such as a two-day course on Computer Assisted
              | Qualitative Data Analysis, with practical demonstrations of up to five packages
              | and hands-on workshops on at least three packages. There was also a two-day
              | course on Handling Qualitative Data followed by a three-day workshop on a
              | programme, and a five-day retreat on the Focus Group method, which included
              | the use of software. [15]
              | Apparently the workshops were open to anyone who was interested in the use of
              | a programme to assist qualitative analysis. Only 3 out of 44 workshops and
              | courses required the fulfilment of some prerequisites. It was prerequisite to have
              | a basic understanding of qualitative methodology to attend a workshop on
              | NUD.IST 4. It was prerequisite to be a researcher or postgraduate student, and to
              | have a basic understanding of qualitative data analysis, to attend an introductory
              | workshop on NUD.IST Vivo. And it was prerequisite to be a full-time or part-time
              | worker on research projects, a social science academic, research officer, or
              | postgraduate research student to attend a two-day course on Computer Assisted
              | Qualitative Data Analysis. [16]
              | This very simple categorisation of the characteristics of current CAQDAS
              | workshops allowed me conclude: (1) most of the workshops are one-day
              | sessions; (2) it is not prerequisite to be a qualitative researcher, nor to have
              | previous knowledge of qualitative research and methods to attend a workshop;
              | (3) although all the workshops are hands-on, only few of them allow participants

              | The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDAS
              | to work with their own data; and (4) almost all of the workshops are intended to
              | train participants in the use of the basic tools of a programme, but a few of them
              | intend to show the participants the relation between qualitative methodology and
              | CAQDAS. [17]
              | These workshops could lead to a misleading use of the programmes as tools to
              | assist qualitative analysis and, in consequence, the undertaking of qualitative
              | research projects in which the qualitative methodology has been replaced or
              | imposed by the software. This is not a joke. It can really happen; and what is
              | worse, it happens. [18]
              | 2.4 "What is the next step?" When coding rules
              | Now I would like to talk about my own experience with a specific workshop, which
              | illustrates the problems that can arise when novice users face CAQDAS. One of
              | the first workshops I ran was in the use of NUD.IST 4, and it was directed to a
              | group of about eight young researchers. They were interested in using a
              | CAQDAS to analyse an enormous amount of field notes they had already made.
              | They wanted a one-day workshop to acquire the basic tools to use NUD.IST 4. [19]
              | After telling them that the programme could not do the analysis for them, I began
              | by the origins of NUD.IST and told them that although its design was based on
              | Grounded Theory, it could be used with any methodology. At this point, they
              | interrupted me and asked me about Grounded Theory, which they did not know.
              | In that moment I stopped and brought up the basics of Grounded Theory, and
              | then continued the workshop as planned. At the end, I told them to email or
              | telephone me in the future if they needed further help in the use of NUD.IST. I
              | should not have done so. [20]
              | Some days after the workshop they called me because they were not sure about
              | how to code. Besides, they wanted more information about the coding process
              | used in Grounded Theory, because they considered that it was the methodology
              | they were going to use, instead of the one they proposed when they designed
              | their research project. Some time later they called me again to tell me what they
              | had done up to that time and then asked me: "what is the next step?" I met them
              | and noticed that they had based all their analysis on the process of coding. I tried
              | to make them realise that maybe that was not the way analysis should be done,
              | but they were just focused on the deadline of their research. What kind of final
              | report did they write? I do not know. What validity does that research have? I do
              | not know either. [21]
              | This experience exemplifies what COFFEY, HOLBROOK and ATKINSON warned
              | us in 1996: the homogenisation of all the ways of doing qualitative analysis due to

              | was designed based on Grounded Theory, that methodology was the one they
              | had to use, because it suited the programme. It also exemplifies one of the

              | conclusions of their research. Instead of this, the use they made of the
              | programme invalidates their conclusions because they forced their methodology
              | to fit the programme's design. They were not critical of the program. They were
              | dazzled by what I call neophilia: a blind trust in what technology brings, taking it
              | for granted, without discussion. [22]
              | 3. Alternatives When Teaching and Learning CAQDAS
              | Bernardo TURNBULL (2001), referring to his own experience, once said:
              | "running [a CAQDAS] without training was much like sneaking into an artisan's
              | workshop and learning about the art and trade by looking at her tools. [...] I have said
              | more than once that teaching the use of a software to someone who could not do the
              | job by hand is dangerous." [23]
              | His experience showed me that I was not alone in this crusade: CAQDAS
              | workshops should not be limited to learning the use of the software's tools. So I
              | wondered, what else must a CAQDAS workshop include? More than the use of
              | the software (anyone who has the user's guide can learn how to use it), the
              | workshops must include basic elements to develop critical thinking in the
              | participants, before the programmes. [24]
              | I designed a one-semester workshop-seminar, titled Herramientas informáticas
              | para el análisis cualitativo (Computer Tools for Qualitative Data Analysis), and
              | proposed it to the Department of Psychology at the Universidad de los Andes. It
              | was accepted and I lectured its first version during the second semester of 2001
              | to last year Psychology undergraduate students1. I want to present here some
              | critical issues raised from this experience, issues that I believe show us new ways
              | to train qualitative researchers in the use of programmes to assist qualitative
              | analysis. [25]
              | 3.1 Giving more information than developing skills
              | WEITZMAN and MILES (1995) designed a worksheet with four key questions to
              | guide researchers to choose the right software. The questions are (p.9): (1) What
              | kind of computer user am I? (2) Am I choosing for one project or the next few
              | years? (3) What kind of project(s) and database(s) will I be working on? (4) What
              | kind of analysis am I planning to do? I consider these four questions to be
              | currently valid, though they were formulated in 1995. Here I want to paraphrase
              | the first question. [26]
              | Most of current CAQDAS workshops (it does not matter which programme), are
              | focused on the use of the programme; i.e., the main goal is that participants
              | acquire the basic skills in the use of a software. As seen above, all the workshops
              | announced on mailing lists refer to one-day or two-day workshops. Basically,
              | what most trainers do in workshops is to show participants how to import
              | 1 A second version will be lectured in the second semester of 2002, focused on four of the most
              | used qualitative methods, and the use of one qualitative programme to assist them.

              | documents into the software, how to create codes or categories (although
              | KELLE, 1996, differentiates codes from categories), how to code, how to create
              | and/or test hypothesis and how to make reports. I myself began by doing so in
              | the first workshops I ran. Paraphrasing WEITZMAN and MILES (1996), what kind
              | of CAQDAS users are we training? I wondered. [27]
              | To use a CAQDAS is more than knowing how to import documents, code them
              | and make reports. It is not only to fit the software to the methodology the
              | researcher is using or vice versa, as shown in the related case. It is also to know
              | how our methodology relates to the tools the software has. I have known
              | researchers who believe that the more tools they use the more complete their
              | analysis is. And other researchers who believe that because the programme does
              | not have the tools they need, it means that their research has exceeded the
              | programme's capacities. Both of these are misconceptions of what the tools and
              | the programmes are for. [28]
              | The students that registered for my seminar were particularly interested in the
              | use of CAQDAS to analyse the data of their undergraduate thesis. But after our
              | first session they were disenchanted: I told them that only in the sixth session we
              | were going to use software. The first five sessions were focused on the
              | introduction to the seminar, the history of CAQDAS, their main characteristics, the
              | process of coding in qualitative research, and the relation between theory-
              | building software and Grounded Theory. This last topic was included to prevent
              | students believing that Grounded Theory is the right methodology to be used
              | when working with CAQDAS. [29]
              | After these seminar sessions, we went into the workshop sessions. I trained my
              | students in the use of EZ-Text, winMAX 99, NUD.IST 4, and Atlas.ti 4.2. I had
              | planned to work with HyperRESEARCH too, but we did not have enough time. By
              | the end of the semester we returned to the seminar sessions to discuss the use
              | of the programmes and the relation between software and qualitative methods.
              | Each of my students was using a particular methodology in his/her thesis, so we
              | could share our points of view about the way each one was going to use the
              | chosen software. [30]
              | In the last session they told me that they had finally understood why the first five
              | sessions were more theoretical than they expected. It is worth saying that all the
              | students who attended my seminar had previously taken a seminar on Qualitative
              | Research, but had no previous knowledge on CAQDAS. [31]
              | I have stated that CAQDAS workshops are open to everyone who wants to use a
              | programme of this kind; it is not a prerequisite to be a qualitative researcher or to
              | have a background on qualitative methodology. Must CAQDAS be limited to be
              | used only by qualitative researchers? I do not think that is the solution. I believe
              | that CAQDAS workshops must include training in qualitative methods if the
              | participants do not have previous knowledge of it. But if participants do, it is worth
              | highlighting that the software is nothing but a tool. A tool that researchers can use
              | in several ways, according to their methodology and needs. Researchers must

              | The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDAS
              | not limit their analysis to the tools that the software has nor be obliged to use all
              | the tools, either. [32]
              | 3.2 Promoting critical thinking instead of mechanical thinking
              | How many of CAQDAS trainers are CAQDAS critics? Most of them defend the
              | advantages CAQDAS brings; but how many of them present on their workshops
              | the disadvantages these programmes bring? To know a software is to know
              | about the methodological implications its use has for qualitative methodology.
              | There are lots of papers, articles and even books about this topic. But how much
              | of this literature is included as basic bibliography in the workshops? I know that
              | some workshops led by universities world-wide promote the discussion about the
              | relationship between CAQDAS use and qualitative methodology. But most of
              | workshops do not. I think that there is an economical factor for this: one-day or
              | two-day workshops are income producing. To include more information in the
              | workshops would imply more than two or three sessions, and it would increase
              | the cost for participants, which would also have a bearing on the number of them.
              | But if we are to do things, we are to do them right. [33]
              | It is not up to the participants who attend a CAQDAS workshop to discover the
              | disadvantages that the use of a specific programme could bring to his/her
              | analysis process. We must warn novice CAQDAS users about the consequences
              | neophilia brings and include readings about the relation between qualitative
              | research and the use of CAQDAS, about the criticisms the use of CAQDAS in
              | qualitative research have received, and about research projects assisted with a
              | programme. In addition to the hands-on workshops the readings can bring
              | participants the opportunity to create their own criterion of CAQDAS. [34]
              | The discussion about the methodological implications that the use of CAQDAS
              | brings to qualitative methodology has been limited to academics. It has become
              | an almost theoretical topic not included in CAQDAS workshops. But I believe that
              | every CAQDAS user has something to say about this, if he/she is given the
              | chance2. Every month there are lots of new researchers trained in the use of a
              | programme to assist qualitative analysis. Even the way all these researchers are
              | using programmes is a researchable field. The academic discussion has to be
              | taken out to the public, and researchers of every kind must be included on it. The
              | creation of a specific "discussion group" about this topic (be it real or virtual)
              | would be a great idea3. [35]
              | This aspect (developing critical thinking) is related to what I presented in Section
              | 3.1. The more information we include in the workshops, the more critical
              | participants will be. The lack of information and the neophilia are the two
              | elements that would lead us to weak qualitative analyses, giving weight to those
              | who believe that to introduce computers in qualitative research is counter-
              | 2 FIELDING and LEE (1998) carried out a project asking users what they were doing.
              | 3 Mailing lists such as QUAL-Software are focused on the diffusion of the programmes and only
              | from time to time some list members question the methodological aspects regarding the use of
              | the software.

              | productive. It is also possible that some of the trained researchers begin to be
              | critical before CAQDAS when using a programme on their own research. That
              | was my case. Nonetheless, I think that by introducing aspects like some
              | programme's weaknesses and the way they organise and systematise the data,
              | participants will not fall in neophilia and will be careful when using a programme
              | to analyse their data. [36]
              | 3.3 When "Bring your own data" means "Analyse your own data"
              | As we could see in Section 2.3, only 7 out of the 44 mentioned CAQDAS
              | workshops invited participants to bring their own data. I know it is impossible to
              | work individually with every participant on his/her own data. It is better to offer
              | personal advice to researchers. Besides, for academic purposes, it is easier to
              | give the participants in a workshop the same documents to do exercises with a
              | programme: we will always know what segments of the document (be it text,
              | images, sound or video) the participants are working with. But is it not a
              | workshop's goal that participants know how to analyse their own data? Of course;
              | but they will only work on their data when returning to their research projects. And
              | the work of trainers ends when the workshops end; and by experience I have
              | learned that giving your telephone number for further questions is not a good idea
              | at all. [37]
              | My experience with the seminar in the Universidad de los Andes showed me that
              | only when participants begin to analyse their own data, can really understand the
              | way the software works and how to use it according to their methodology. I used
              | my own material to train my students, although they began to analyse their own
              | thesis material by the mid-semester. From that moment the questions they had
              | about the use of the software increased a hundred percent. By the end of the
              | semester they suggested to me to allow them to use their own data from the
              | beginning: "it was easier for me to use the programme when analysing my
              | interviews, because I knew what my research question was, and what I was
              | looking for in the answers of my interviewees", one of them said, and the others
              | agreed. [38]
              | I believe that once the participants have been trained in the basic tools of a
              | programme, it is time to allow them to experience the programme by themselves.
              | By doing so, they will find the best way to segment and code their data, and how
              | codes and categories can be organised. Trainers must not only guide participants
              | in the appropriate use of the software according to the methodology participants
              | are using, but they also have to confront them with the decisions they have to
              | make in the process of analysis. [39]
              | Of course, this is only possible if the workshops are not limited to one or two
              | days. This process of accompanying novice CAQDAS users implies a long time
              | course. I think that this process is only possible in academic environments
              | (undergraduate and postgraduate research students), or with full-time and part-
              | time researchers really interested in the use of a programme to assist their
              | analysis. But people interested only in the mechanical operation of the software

              | The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDAS
              | can be trained in one session. I myself was trained in a three-hour session on
              | NUD.IST 4, the first programme to assist qualitative analysis I knew; nonetheless,
              | only when analysing my own data did I found that there was something missing in
              | the programme and its relation to qualitative methodology. [40]
              | 3.4 The wide panorama: there is no "best" programme
              | CAQDAS workshops are planned to train in the use of only one programme. Only
              | one of the above mentioned workshops was intended to show participants more
              | than one programme (the course on Computer Assisted Qualitative Data
              | Analysis), but it was not precisely a training workshop. I believe that when training
              | people who do not have previous knowledge of any software to assist qualitative
              | analysis, we must show them that there is not only one programme. We must tell
              | them about the wide variety of software available and the different functions they
              | have. I know that training in the full use of a programme would imply a very long
              | process; but by giving participants the basic tools of various programmes, and by
              | allowing them to experience the software with their own data, they would select
              | the appropriate programme according to the tools it has and the type of analysis
              | the participants are going to do. I have already related the case of the researcher
              | who wanted to buy the "best" programme. She trained herself with the demo
              | version of NUD.IST Vivo, and decided that that was the best programme, but did
              | not try other software. [41]
              | As shown in Section 2.3 most of CAQDAS workshops are on Atlas.ti, NUD.IST
              | versions Vivo, 4 and 5, and a smaller number on winMAX and The Ethnograph.
              | But there are many other programmes: AQUAD, CoAn, Code-A-Text, Diction,
              | DIMAP, HyperRESEARCH, KEDS, TEXTPACK, TexSmart, and BEST, among
              | others. It is not that someone interested in the use of a CAQDAS must be trained
              | in all of this software, but if trainers show participants the wide variety of existing
              | programmes and their main characteristics and functions, participants will have
              | real elements to choose the software that better fits their needs. [42]
              | In my seminar I trained my students in the use of the basic tools of four
              | programmes, with the possibility of using the complete version of three of them.
              | This, combined with discussions about the methodology they were going to use
              | on their thesis, gave us the opportunity to choose the most adequate software for
              | their particular needs. In the end, all of the participants chose the same software
              | although their methodologies were very different. To decide what software to use,
              | they took into account two factors: the user-friendliness and the flexibility. They
              | told me that they did not want a programme that was very rigid in the organisation
              | of the categories and material; they preferred a programme that would allow them
              | to play with the categories and to create their own relations among all the
              | elements of their research. "Flexibility; that's the clue", they concluded. [43]

              | 4. Closing Note4
              | Computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software has become a basic tool for
              | qualitative researchers; a tool to aid them in their process of analysis. Cutting with
              | scissors and pasting with glue, our traditional way of systematising our data, is
              | now seen as archaic work. However, we cannot forget that that way of
              | systematising was widely used by every qualitative researcher round the world
              | until a decade ago; even today some researchers still use index cards and
              | cabinets to organise their data. And it works. [44]
              | What are the advantages of using software to assist qualitative analysis, then?
              | These programmes facilitate the processes of segmenting, categorising,
              | annotating, retrieving, and searching within and across documents and
              | categories. All of this can be done in a fast way, and the original documents are
              | not fragmented. Researchers can find what they want just by doing the right
              | selection, and the PCs can store lots of documents that otherwise required big
              | cabinets and folders. The programmes by themselves are neither good nor bad
              | for qualitative research. It is the way that qualitative researchers use them that
              | influences qualitative methodology. Even so, in some cases, programmes have
              | replaced the method. And it is a real fact that some programmes, especially
              | those based on Grounded Theory, include new tools that were not used before in
              | qualitative methods. These new tools imply new ways of doing qualitative analysis
              | (KELLE, 1996), but are not intended to be a method by themselves. [45]
              | Every qualitative researcher who uses CAQDAS is responsible if the programme
              | replaces the method. Over all, this is a responsibility of every researcher who
              | trains in the use of CAQDAS. We cannot believe that these programmes are the
              | panacea in qualitative analysis just because they are widely used today. In
              | Colombia the use of this software is still limited to small groups of researchers. I
              | believe this is the reason why it was easy for me to notice that the workshops
              | focused on the use of the software would raise methodological implications for
              | qualitative research. [46]
              | Based on my experience, I have presented four critical issues that I believe
              | qualitative researchers must bear in mind when training or being trained in the
              | use of CAQDAS: giving more information, promoting critical thinking, the
              | possibility of analysing participant's own data, and knowing the wide variety of
              | programmes. These issues would prevent a misuse of CAQDAS and would
              | strengthen qualitative research methods. The programmes are the tools and we
              | are the artisans. It is up to us how we use them. [47]
              | 4 Once this article was finished I received information about two articles that discusses this topic:
              | MANGABEIRA, LEE and FIELDING (2001) and FIELDING and LEE (2002), of which
              | conclusions I do not reference here. The first article, specially, is about two studies the authors
              | did with CAQDAS users and their expectations. Their findings in the United Kingdom are very
              | similar to the ones I found in Colombia.
