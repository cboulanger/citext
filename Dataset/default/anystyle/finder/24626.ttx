              | Abstract
              | Globalization here is understood to be a multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, multiform,
              | and multicausal process, which has much less of an explanans and more of an
              | explanandum. In recent analysis globalization has been found to be about place, space, and
              | scale. Yet, following its title, this paper argues that it is about time too. In other words,
              | globalization is also a spatio-temporal process. The nature of this process, its relation with
              | the development of capitalist economies and the role of the state, are at the core of this
              | paper.
              | Zusammenfassung
              | Globalisierung wird hier als Prozess verstanden mit vielfältigen Ursachen und
              | Ausprägungen, mit zeitlichen und räumlichen Aspekten sowie einer polyzentrischen Natur.
              | Dabei wird Globalisierung weniger als erklärendes, sondern vielmehr als zu erklärendes
              | Phänomen gedeutet. In der gegenwärtigen sozialwissenschaftlichen Analyse wird
              | Globalisierung in Zusammenhang mit örtlichen, räumlichen und skalaren Veränderungen
              | gebracht. Wie der Titel dieses Papiers aber andeutet, handelt es sich ebenso um ein
              | zeitbezogenes Phänomen: Globalisierung wird somit als räumlich-zeitlicher Prozess
              | verstanden. Die Natur dieses Prozesses, seine Verbindungen mit der Entwicklung
              | kapitalistischer Ökonomien und die Rolle des Staates werden im Fokus dieser Arbeit stehen.

text          | I H S — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — 1
              | The title of this paper involves a deliberate play on words. It is also meant to make some
              | serious theoretical and political points about the nature of globalization. It is certainly not
              | about time that we begin to talk of globalization. On the contrary, the time is now well past
              | when it first began to be seriously questioned. Indeed, for many commentators, it is high time
              | that the concept of globalization was banned. Nor does the title indicate that strategies to
              | promote globalization are overdue and that it is about time that the globalization project was
              | taken further. Instead the title is intended to suggest that it is high time that we recognized –
              | both theoretically and politically – that globalization is not just about place, space, and scale.
              | It is about time too. Globalization is a phenomenon of a ‘runaway world,’ of the annihilation of
              | distance by time, of the increasing acceleration of social events and processes. And, to go
              | further, it is a phenomenon that causes problems as much, if not more, because of its
              | complex temporalities as it does because of its complex spatialities. In short, if we are to
              | understand and control globalization, it is about time that we realized that it is a spatio-
              | temporal process.
              | In developing this argument, I first critique some recent simplified ideas about globalization,
              | insisting on its many complexities and suggesting that the concept of globalization would be
              | better seen as an explanandum than as an explanans. Second, building on the multicentric,
              | multiscalar, and multitemporal features of globalization as well as the notions of time-space
              | distantiation and time-space compression, I argue that the spatial turn involved in many
              | recent discussions of globalization has been overdone and that it is time to combine it with a
              | temporal (re)turn that can do justice to the complex spatio-temporalities of globalization. I
              | illustrate this argument from Marx’s work on the political economy of capitalism and,
              | especially, his analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics that are generated by its
              | organization as an economy of time. Third, in this context I introduce the concept of
              | spacetime and spatio-temporal fixes and draw out some of the theoretical implications of
              | such fixes for understanding the nature and problems of globalization. Fourth, I explore
              | some of the temporal contradictions of the current globalizing phase of a post-Fordist,
              | knowledge-based capitalism. Fifth, in the light of these remarks, I consider the implications of
              | globalization for the national state, noting in particular the challenges to its temporal
              | sovereignty. Here I consider the politics of time involved in globalization, the ways in which
              | this challenges the national sovereign state and the practices of democratic politics, and then
              | suggest some ways to address the acceleration of economic processes associated with the
              | current wave of globalization. My reflections conclude with some general remarks on the
              | importance of temporality to an understanding and critique of globalization.
              | 2 — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — I H S
              | 1. Globalization
              | ‘Globalization’ is a polyvalent, promiscuous, controversial word that often obscures more
              | than it reveals about recent economic, political, social, and cultural changes. It is best used
              | to denote a multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, multiform, and multicausal process.
              | First, it is multicentric because it emerges from activities in many places rather than from a
              | single centre. It cannot be reduced to Americanization, as some critics of American
              | imperialism suggest, but emanates from many sites around the globe. Moreover, even if one
              | were to insist against the evidence that it was primarily an American-initiated phenomenon, it
              | would still be necessary to recognize the plurality of globalization processes and effects
              | depending on whether one looked at American influences emanating from New York as a
              | financial centre, Washington as an imperial city, Atlanta as a global news factory, Hollywood
              | as an entertainment capital, Silicon Valley as the centre of informational capitalism, and so
              | on. The same point would apply, of course, to the alleged centrality of other national
              | formations.
              | Second, globalization is multiscalar because it emerges from actions on many scales –
              | which can no longer be seen as nested in a neat hierarchy but as co-existing and
              | interpenetrating in a tangled and confused manner – and it develops and deepens the scalar
              | as well as the spatial division of labour. This excludes any simple opposition between the
              | global and the national or the global and the local. Indeed, in some ways, the global is little
              | more than ‘a hugely extended network of localities’ (Czarniawska and Sevón 1996: 22). More
              | generally, what could be described from one vantagepoint as globalization might be re-
              | described (and, perhaps, more accurately) in rather different terms from one or more
              | alternative scalar viewpoints: for example, as internationalization, triadization, regional bloc
              | formation, global city network-building, cross-border region formation, international
              | localization, glocalization, glurbanization, or transnationalization. For, regardless of their own
              | distinctive dynamics, if any, each of these scalar processes is also linked more or less
              | closely into the overall dynamic of globalization – whether as modifying, counteracting, or
              | reinforcing processes.
              | Third, the latter dynamic is multitemporal because it involves an ever more complex
              | restructuring and re-articulation of temporalities and time horizons. This aspect is captured in
              | the notions of time -space distantiation and time -space compression. The former process
              | involves the stretching of social relations over time and space so that relations can be
              | controlled or co-ordinated over longer periods of time (including the ever more distant future)
              | and longer distances, greater areas, or more scales of activity. The ultimate spatial horizon of
              | time-space distantiation is, of course, total control over social relations on a fully integrated
              | global scale into the foreseeable future. There are good reasons, however, to regard this
              | ultimate horizon as implausible. The latter process involves the intensification of ‘discrete’
              | I H S — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — 3
              | events in real time and/or the increased velocity of material and immaterial flows over a
              | given distance. This is also a significant (and also incompletely developed) aspect of
              | globalization and, indeed, it is time-space compression more than time-space distantiation
              | that is more distinctive of the most recent wave of globalization. If we examine the interaction
              | between these two processes, it becomes evident that much of the fascination with
              | globalization is rooted in the increased significance of social forces and processes that
              | combine capacities for time-space distantiation and compression: the most obvious (in the
              | sense of most cited) case is hypermobile financial capital that can circulate globally in real
              | time. But focusing on such cases ignores the significance of other forces and processes that
              | are located elsewhere in the two-dimensional property space that can be derived from using
              | degrees of time-space distantiation and time-space compression as its respective horizontal
              | and vertical axes.
              | Fourth, globalization is multiform. It assumes different forms in different contexts and can be
              | realized through different strategies – neo-liberal globalization with its emphasis on the
              | integration of the world market along neo-liberal lines is only one of these general forms and
              | even this having several significant variants. Once one allows for other forms of
              | technological and economic globalization and other sites and processes of globalization
              | across different functional systems and the lifeworld (or civil society), then the multiformity of
              | globalization appears even more strongly.
              | Finally, globalization is clearly multicausal because it results from the complex, contingent
              | interaction of many different causal processes. For, taken together, the preceding features
              | mean that, far from globalization being a unitary causal mechanism, it should be understood
              | as the complex, emergent product of many different forces operating on many scales. Hence
              | nothing can be explained in terms of the causal powers of globalization – let alone causal
              | powers that are inevitable and irreversible and that are actualized on some intangible stage
              | behind our backs or on some intangible plane above our heads. Instead globalizations
              | themselves need explaining in all their manifold spatio-temporal complexity. This does not
              | exclude specific hypotheses about the impact of clearly specifiable processes on particular
              | sets of social relations. Thus one might be able to investigate the extent to which the
              | increasing hypermobility of financial capital affects the capacities of national states to set real
              | interest rates to secure full employment levels of demand. But one could not meaningfully
              | investigate the wild and overgeneral claim that "globalization undermines the power of the
              | state.” This point highlights the more general point about the multicentric, multiscalar,
              | multitemporal, and multiform nature of globalization. Moreover, once we understand how
              | globalizing processes are generated and how they operate, we can better intervene in their
              | production and better resist some of their effects.
              | In spite of these arguments, it is still possible and worthwhile to reflect on the nature of
              | globalization. But we must define globalization with all due caution and in ways that allow for
              | the above-mentioned complexities. Thus I would propose here that globalization has both
              | 4 — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — I H S
              | structural and strategic moments. Structurally, it involves the objective processes whereby
              | increasing global interdependence is created among actions, organizations, and institutions
              | within (but not necessarily across) different functional systems (economy, law, politics,
              | education, science, sport, etc.) and the lifeworld that lies beyond them. These processes
              | occur on various spatial scales, operate differently in each functional subsystem, involve
              | complex and tangled causal hierarchies rather than a simple, unilinear, bottom-up or top-
              | down movement, and often display an eccentric ‘nesting’ of the different scales of social
              | organization. They also develop unevenly in spacetime. Nonetheless, globalization can be
              | said to increase insofar as the co-variation of actions, events, and institutional orders
              | involves more (and more important) relevant activities, is spatially more extensive, and
              | occurs more rapidly.
              | Strategically, globalization refers to conscious attempts to promote global co-ordination of
              | activities in (but not necessarily across) different functional subsystems and/or in the
              | lifeworld. This does not require that the actors involved are physically present at all points in
              | the planet but only requires them to monitor relevant activities, communicate about these,
              | and try to co-ordinate their activities with others to produce global effects. Such co-ordination
              | efforts range from generalized meta-steering (constitutional or institutional design) intended
              | to produce a more or less comprehensive global order through creation of international
              | regimes to particularistic pursuit of specific economic-corporate interests within such (meta-)
              | frameworks. There is clearly scope for wide variation here as shown by the neo-liberal,
              | market-led globalization promoted by the World Bank, the horizontal ‘global governance’
              | favoured by proponents (especially NGOs) of democratic international regimes, and plans for
              | more top-down inter-statal government. Not all actors are (or could hope to be) major global
              | players but many more have to monitor the global as a horizon of action, the implications of
              | changing scalar divisions, and the impact of time-space distantiation and compression on
              | their identities, interests, and strategies. The overall course of globalization will be the largely
              | unintended, relatively chaotic outcome of interaction among various strategies to shape or
              | resist globalization in a complex, path-dependent world society. It follows that any account of
              | globalization is likely to be partial and incomplete, exaggerating some features, missing
              | others, and risking neglect of events and processes on other scales.
              | Globalization is part of a proliferation of scales and temporalities as narrated, institutionalized
              | objects of action, regularization, and governance. The number of scales and temporalities of
              | action that can be distinguished is immense but far fewer ever get explicitly institutionalized.
              | How far this happens depends on the prevailing technologies of power – material, social,
              | and spatio-temporal – that enable the identification and institutionalization of specific scales
              | of action and temporalities. It is the development of new logistical means (of distantiation,
              | compression, communication), organizational technologies, institutions with new spatio-
              | temporal horizons of action, broader institutional architectures, new global standards
              | (including world time), and modes of governance that helps to explain this growing
              | proliferation of economically and politically significant institutionalized scales and
              | I H S — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — 5
              | temporalities. Moreover, as new scales and temporalities emerge and/or existing ones gain
              | in institutional thickness, social forces also tend to develop new mechanisms to link or co-
              | ordinate them. This in turn often prompts efforts to co-ordinate these new co-ordination
              | mechanisms. Thus, as the triad regions begin to acquire institutional form and identity, new
              | forums develop to co-ordinate their bilateral relations. Likewise, as regionalism develops in
              | the European Union, we find not only an EU-wide Committee of the Regions but also a
              | proliferation of other peak associations and multilateral linkages among regions. Even further
              | down the scale, local authorities develop associations to promote their interests at national,
              | regional, international, and global levels. All of this produces increasing scalar complexity,
              | increasing scope for deliberate interscalar articulation, and increasing problems in making
              | such interscalar articulation work. Similar issues occur in relation to time and its governance.
              | This can be seen in the rise of nano -temporalities at the micro-level and long -term action to
              | ensure environmental sustainability at the macro-level. And this leads in turn to growing
              | problems of intertemporal governance.
              | 2. Globalization and the Spatial Turn
              | Commentators often portray globalization as one of the driving forces in the ‘spatial turn’ in
              | the social sciences and/or as one of its most important products. For, insofar as globalization
              | appears to be an essentially spatial phenomenon, it allegedly demands an approach that is
              | sensitive to issues of space, place, and scale. Moreover, when we approach globalization in
              | such terms, this often changes how other issues are seen. The spatial turn can be thematic,
              | methodological, or both (cf. Jessop 2001). In the first sense it involves thematizing
              | intrinsically spatial issues as objects of analysis. This sort of turn is hardly controversial
              | provided that it does not lead to a fetishistic naturalization of space, place, and scale or to
              | the belief that space, place, and scale have their own autonomous properties regardless of
              | their social constitution and reproduction and regardless of their articulation with other
              | moments of social relations. In the second sense, the spatial turn involves an investigation of
              | more complex issues by using their spatial moments as an entry point, without this requiring
              | that the investigation does not proceed beyond the spatial. In either case, the spatial turn
              | could involve little more than an innocent, belated, and welcome recognition that space
              | matters in one or more ways; but it could also involve the belief that an earlier interest in time
              | and temporal issues was mistaken, overdone, or at best misleading. In short, there is a risk
              | that the spatial turn is seen as a simple alternative to a focus on temporality. What is really
              | required is a discussion of spatio-temporality rather than implying that there is a choice
              | between them.
              | The ability to integrate the spatial and temporal aspects of globalization is evident in Marx’s
              | critique of political economy and his analysis of capitalism in terms of an economy of time.
              | The key point here is that the spatial dynamic of capitalism can be derived in the first
              | 6 — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — I H S
              | instance from the competition among capitalists to reduce socially necessary labour time as
              | well as the total time involved in production. Marx showed that individual capitals are subject
              | to competitive pressure to reduce production, circulation, and turnover times. They also face
              | pressure to innovate in other ways that may affect the spatial and scalar divisions of labour.
              | In this sense, although place and space are certainly regarded as a basic material
              | presupposition of all social activities, their entry into Marx’s analysis as major variables come
              | much later in the course of his analysis. They are first seriously introduced in terms of
              | particular capitals rather than capital in general; in terms of turnover time rather than
              | production time; and in the context of use-value (e.g., transportation) rather than that of
              | value or exchange-value (de la Haye 1988). This spatial reorganization was as prone to
              | contradictions, however, as any feature of capital as a social relation. For our purposes, this
              | implies, of course, that globalization is also contradictory and will have its limits.
              | These points about Marx’s analysis of time and space are worth making because contrasting
              | views have been expressed about their relative primacy in capitalism. It has been suggested
              | that capital’s concern with the production of value leads to an emphasis on increasing the
              | socially necessary labour time embodied in commodities (the time of labour); that its concern
              | with the production of surplus value leads to an emphasis on control over space and the
              | importance of constructing and reconstructing space relations and the global space
              | economy; that its concern with profits leads to an emphasis on reducing the socially
              | necessary turnover time of circulating capital and that this is often associated with command
              | over space (means of communication and transportation) as well as organizational
              | innovations; that its concern with social use-value is associated with an emphasis on the
              | spatial relations that determine the usefulness of particular goods and services and/or on the
              | time and/or timing of the delivery of goods and services; and, finally, those who take class
              | struggle as their entry point (especially the struggles of subordinate classes) tend to focus on
              | place and space. For, as Soja comments, class struggle ‘must encompass and focus upon
              | the vulnerable point: the production of space, the territorial structure of exploitation and
              | domination, the spatially controlled reproduction of the system as a whole’ (Soja 1989: 92).
              | Such contrasting opinions are not so much signs of intellectual incoherence as expressions
              | of basic contradictions in capitalism itself. This is reflected in the contrast between the
              | mobility of abstract money capital in a space of flows and the commodified production and
              | consumption of specific use-values in specific times and places. Yet even this contrast is
              | only ever tendential and relative, for ‘in every instance when we accentuate space or time,
              | the other aspect is still present, although hidden’ (Czarniawska and Sevón 1996: 21). Thus
              | the mobility of abstract money capital in a space of flows depends on the development of the
              | sort of fixed technical and social infrastructures that characterize the emerging network of
              | global cities. And the production and consumption of specific use-values involves a spatial
              | and scalar division of labour which must also be co-ordinated across different time scales
              | (e.g., associated with different production cycles, different ratios of fixed to circulating capital,
              | and different degrees of durability of goods and services destined for private consumption).
              | I H S — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — 7
              | There are also ‘contradictory movements in which time is simultaneously compressed and
              | expanded, depending on which part of the system one examines, so that the general
              | progression is uneven and punctuated by more or less significant reverses’ (Schoenberger
              | 1997: 19). This suggests the need to make a thematic and metho dological temporal (re)turn
              | to redress one-sided concern with space in studies of globalization. Interestingly, just such a
              | temporal (re)turn can be seen in a growing recognition of the need to bring time (back) into
              | the analysis of globalization among those who had previously privileged the spatial.
              | 3. On Spatio-Temporal Fixes and the
              | Contradictions of Capitalism
              | Here I want to argue that the reproduction and regularization of capital as a social relation
              | involves a social fix (complex mode of regularization) that compensates for the inherent
              | incompleteness of the pure capital relation, i.e., its inability to secure the conditions for the
              | continued expansion of capital accumulation purely in and through the operation of profit-
              | oriented, market-mediated economic forces. This social fix is always time-and-place specific
              | and gives a specific dynamic to capital accumulation through its distinctive, historically
              | variable, and inherently unstable articulation of economic and extra-economic elements. The
              | importance of these extra-economic elements is widely recognized, of course, in very
              | different social scientific literatures (Smithian, Marxian, Weberian, Durkheimian, liberal and
              | neo-liberal, institutionalist, etc). But there is also widespread disagreement about its
              | implications. On my reading, this social fix helps to secure a relatively durable structural
              | coherence in managing the contradictions and dilemmas inherent in the capital relation so
              | that different forms, institutions, and practices tend to be mutually reinforcing. This includes
              | the imposition on these economic and extra-economic elements of a distinctive spatio-
              | temporal fix.
              | Structurally, these spatio-temporal fixes emerge when an accumulation regime and its
              | complex mode of regularization co-evolve to produce a certain structural coherence within a
              | given spatio-temporal framework but not beyond it. This is typically associated with a
              | distinctive hierarchy of the various structural or institutional forms of capitalism that thereby
              | affects their interactions within the institutional architecture as a whole and shapes the
              | overall logic of the spatio-temporal fix. This hierarchy involves giving greater priority to the
              | regularizing of some structural forms (and giving greater priority, perhaps, to one or other
              | aspect of their associated contradictions and dilemmas) than to other structural forms. These
              | priorities will vary with accumulation regimes, modes of growth, and governance capacities.
              | In the Atlantic Fordism associated with the thirty years of postwar economic expansion in
              | most advanced capitalist economies, for example, the wage and money forms were the
              | principal structural forms at the heart of the mode of regularization. In constrast, in the
              | emerging post-Fordist regime based on a globalizing knowledge-based economy, other
              | 8 — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — I H S
              | forms have become more important and, indeed, critical to the eventual consolidation of a
              | new accumulation regime and mode of regularization. These are the forms of competition
              | and the institutional forms and functions of the state. Or, again, while liberal market
              | economies may give more weight to labour-power as a substitutable factor of production and
              | to the wage as a cost of production, more co-ordinated capitalist economies may prioritize
              | labour-power in its guise as human capital (sic) and the wage as a source of demand.
              | Strategically, because capitalism’s contradictions and dilemmas are insoluble in the abstract,
              | they are resolved – partially and provisionally, if at all – through the formulation-realization of
              | specific accumulation strategies at various economic and political scales in specific spatio-
              | temporal contexts.
              | Such spatio-temporal fixes delimit the main spatial and temporal boundaries within which
              | structural coherence is secured, and externalize certain costs of securing this coherence
              | beyond these boundaries. Even within these boundaries some classes, class fractions,
              | social categories or other social forces located inside these spatio-temporal boundaries are
              | marginalized, excluded, or oppressed. Thus, spatio-temporal fixes also facilitate the
              | institutionalized compromises on which accumulation regimes and modes of regulation
              | depend, and subsequently come to embody them. This can involve super-exploitation of
              | internal or external spaces outside the compromise, super-exploitation of nature or inherited
              | social resources, deferral of problems into an indefinite future and, of course, the exploitation
              | and/or oppression of specific classes, strata or other social categories.
              | Nonetheless, insofar as such compromises marginalize forces that act as bearers of
              | functions or operations essential to long-run accumulation, the growth of significant
              | imbalances, disproportionalities or disunity in the circuit of capital will tend to strengthen the
              | hand of these forces, enabling them to disrupt the institutionalized compromises involved in
              | a particular accumulation regime, mode of regulation, state form and spatio-temporal fix (cf.
              | Clarke 1977). Such crises typically act as a steering mechanism for the always provisional,
              | partial and unstable re-equilibration of capital accumulation insofar as they prompt attempts
              | to guide the forcible reimposition of the unity of the circuit of capital through new
              | accumulation strategies and modes of regulation.
              | The primary scales and temporal horizons around which such fixes are built and the extent
              | of their coherence vary considerably over time. This is reflected in the variable coincidence
              | of different boundaries, borders or frontiers of action and the changing primacy of different
              | scales. Political boundaries, for example, have been characterized by medieval polymorphy,
              | Westphalian exclusivity, and post-Westphalian complexity. Likewise, the consolidation of
              | capitalism witnessed the national eclipse of the urban scale as cities were integrated into
              | national economic systems and subordinated to the political power of national territorial
              | states. And the national scale has since been challenged by the rise of global city networks
              | more oriented to other global cities than to national hinterlands.
              | I H S — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — 9
              | These ideas have important implications for accumulation strategies, state projects, and
              | hegemonic projects on various scales of action and over different time horizons. For each of
              | these involves an attempt to strategically co-ordinate activities across different systems and
              | the lifeworld in order to achieve a limited, localized structural coherence in accumulation,
              | state activities and social formations respectively. There is ample scope for competition
              | among social forces over accumulation strategies, state projects, and hegemonic visions as
              | well as for potential disjunctions between the strategies that emerge from such competition
              | to dominate their respective imagined spheres. In this context a key role is played by the
              | rivalries and struggles of intellectual forces, individually and collectively, in a free-floating or
              | an organized manner, to articulate strategies, projects and visions that seek to reconcile
              | contradictions and conflicts and to resolve dilemmas for various sites and scales of action
              | (cf. Gramsci 1971). The principal forces involved in these rivalries and struggles are
              | organized interests, political parties, and social movements with the mass media rather than
              | the public sphere now having a central position in the mediation of the struggle for
              | hegemony in these matters.
              | As part of a given spatio-temporal fix, different institutions, apparatuses or agencies may
              | specialize primarily in one or other horn of a dilemma, deal with it over different temporal
              | horizons, or address different aspects at different times. The state may also alter the balance
              | between institutions, apparatuses and agencies by reallocating responsibilities and
              | resources, allowing them to compete for political support and legitimacy as circumstances
              | change, etc. Such strategies may be pursued entirely within the state or extend to the
              | division between state and non -state modes of governance. Another way to manage
              | potential problems arising from the limits of different modes of policy-making or crisis-
              | management is through variable policy emphases across different scales of action and
              | temporal horizons. For example, in Atlantic Fordism, the national state set the
              | macroeconomic framework, the local state acted as its relay for many nationally -determined
              | policies, and intergovernmental cooperation in various international regimes maintained the
              | conditions for national economic growth. Likewise, in contemporary neoliberal accumulation
              | regimes, a relative neglect of substantive (as opposed to formal) supply-side conditions at
              | the international and national levels in favour of capital flows in and through space is partly
              | compensated by more interventionist policies at the regional, urban and local levels, where
              | many material interdependencies among specific productive capitals are located (Gough and
              | Eisenschitz 1996). This helps explain why local states are being reorganized as new forms of
              | local or regional partnership emerge to guide and promote the development of local or
              | regional resources.
              | Another example of spatial-scalar divisions of labour is the distinction between foreign and
              | domestic relations inherent in the modern state system such that some parts of the state
              | apparatus specialize in external relations, some in internal relations. However, with the
              | growing impact of globalization and new forms of competitiveness, inherited divisions of
              | state labour change. Thus, not only is the distinction between domestic and foreign policy
              | 10 — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — I H S
              | becoming blurred; but subnational governments are now getting engaged in foreign
              | (economic) policy through cross-border cooperation, international localization, and so on, at
              | the same time as supranational bodies get involved in the redesign and reorientation of
              | subnational politics.
              | There can also be a temporal division of labour with different institutions, apparatuses or
              | agencies responding to contradictions, dilemmas and paradoxes over different time
              | horizons. This is reflected in the conventional distinction between planning and execution
              | within organizations and in the primacy of different temporal horizons across organizations
              | (for example, banks and central banks, computer-programmed arbitrage funds and long-term
              | venture capital funds). Similarly, corporatist arrangements have often been established to
              | address long-term economic and social issues where complex, reciprocal interdependence
              | requires long-term cooperation – thereby taking the relevant policy areas outside the short-
              | term time horizons of electoral cycles and parliamentary in-fighting. In both cases there is
              | scope for activities to rebalance relations among these institutions, apparatuses or agencies
              | through differential allocation of resources; allowing them to compete for legitimacy in
              | changing circumstances.
              | 4. Spatio-Temporal Contradictions in
              | Contemporary Capitalism
              | The multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, multiform, and multicausal processes associated
              | with globalization enhance capital’s capacity to defer and displace its internal contradictions,
              | if not to resolve them, by increasing the scope of its operations on a global scale, by
              | reinforcing its capacities to disembed certain of its operations from local material, social, and
              | spatio-temporal constraints, by enabling it to deepen the spatial and scalar divisions of
              | labour, by creating more opportunities for moving up, down, and across scales, by
              | commodifying and securitizing the future, by deferring past and present material problems
              | into the future, by promoting long-term technology forecasting, organizational learning, and
              | trust building, and by re-articulating different time horizons. These enhanced capacities can
              | markedly reinforce tendencies to uneven development as the search continues for new
              | spatio-temporal displacements and new spatio-temporal fixes. Above all, globalization helps
              | to emancipate the exchange-value moment of capital from extra-economic and spatio-
              | temporal constraints, increases the emphasis on speed, acceleration, and turnover time, and
              | enhances capital’s capacity to escape the control of other systems insofar as these are still
              | territorially differentiated and fragmented. 1 This is linked to its increased capacity for
              | discounting events (so collapsing the future into the present), its increased capacity for time-
              | 1 Conversely, the growth of global legal and political systems and other international regimes means that mobile
              | capital will remain subject to their constraints.
              | I H S — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — 11
              | space compression, its resort to complex derivative trading to manage risk, and its capacities
              | to jump scale. Finally, globalization weakens the capacity of national states to guide capital’s
              | expansion within a framework of national security (as reflected in the ‘national security
              | state’), national welfare (as reflected in social democratic welfare states), or some other
              | national project with a corresponding spatio-temporal fix. And, conversely, it increases the
              | pressures on national states to adjust to the time horizons and temporalities of mobile capital
              | able to operate beyond their frontiers.
              | In short, the development of a globalizing capitalism typically intensifies the spatio-temporal
              | contradictions and tensions inherent in the capital relation and/or its articulation and co-
              | evolution with the spatialities and temporalities of the natural and social world beyond the
              | sphere of value relations. The increasing emphasis on speed and the growing acceleration
              | of social life is particularly disruptive and disorienting (see Virilio 1994; 1998). Here I want to
              | note five tensions or contradictions it introduces into the globalizing economy. These are not
              | engendered by globalization as such; my approach to globalization rules this out. But they
              | are tensions or contradictions that become more severe with the increasing organizational
              | and spatio-temporal complexity and flexibility in the circuits of capital associated with
              | globalization.
              | First, there is a tension between the complex, reciprocally interdependent substantive
              | reproduction requirements of real natural, social, and cultural processes and the simplified,
              | one-sided, monetized temporalities involved in capital’s emphasis on exchange-value.
              | Globalization reinforces this tension by making it easier for capital to destroy the local
              | bounties of first and second nature and then move on without regard to their long-term
              | reproduction. Indeed, the growing emphasis on artificial short -term profit means that, ‘as
              | capital speeds up, it diminishes or degrades the conditions of the natural reproduction of
              | natural things’ (Brennan 1995: 31).
              | Second, there is a tension among the many and varied substantive temporalities of human
              | existence (biological, sentient, sociocultural, self-reflexive) and the abstract time inherent in
              | the commodification of labour power and the dominance of formal market rationality (Stahel
              | 1999: 108; see also Polanyi 1944). This is reflected in the stresses of everyday life and in a
              | growing sense of time-space compression.
              | Third, contemporary capitalism involves a paradox that ‘(t)he most advanced economies
              | function more and more in terms of the extra-economic’ (Veltz 1996: 12). This rests on the
              | increasing interdependence between economic and extra-economic factors making for
              | structural competitiveness. This is linked to the growth of new technologies based on more
              | complex transnational, national, and regional systems of innovation, to the paradigm shift
              | from Fordism with its emphasis on productivity growth rooted in economies of scale to post-
              | Fordism with its emphasis on mobilising social as well as economic sources of flexibility and
              | entrepreneurialism, and to the more general attempts to penetrate micro-social relations in
              | 12 — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — I H S
              | the interests of valorization. It is reflected in the emphasis now given to social capital, trust,
              | and communities of learning as well as to the competitive role of entrepreneurial cities,
              | enterprise culture, and enterprising subjects. This paradox generates a major contradiction
              | between short-term economic calculation (especially in financial flows) and the long-term
              | dynamic of ‘real competition’ rooted in resources (skills, trust, heightened reflexivity,
              | collective mastery of techniques, economies of agglomeration and size) that may take years
              | to create, stabilize, and reproduce. Likewise, spatially, there is a basic contradiction between
              | the economy seen as a de-territorialized, socially disembedded space of flows and as a
              | territorially rooted, socially embedded system of extra-economic as well as economic
              | resources, competencies, and activities (Storper 1997). The latter moment is reflected in
              | wide range of new concepts to describe the knowledge-driven economy – national, regional,
              | and local systems of innovation, innovative milieus, systemic or structural competitiveness,
              | learning regions, social capital, trust, learning-by-doing, speed-based competition, etc. This
              | poses new dilemmas for the stabilization of the capital relation over more scales and over
              | increasingly compressed as well as extended temporal horizons of action.
              | Fourth, temporally, there is a tension between the drive to accelerate the circulation of capital
              | by shortening the production cycle between design and final consumption and the long-term
              | infrastructural development on which this depends. In this context, Harvey notes that ‘[I]t
              | takes a specific organization of space to try and annihilate space and it takes capital of long
              | turnover time to facilitate the more rapid turnover of the rest. But the reduction of spatial
              | barriers has an equally powerful opposite effect; small-scale and finely graded differences
              | between the qualities of places (their labor supply, their infrastructures, and political
              | receptivity, their resource mixes, their market niches, etc.) become even more important
              | because multinational capital is better able to exploit them. (1996a: 246–7). This set of
              | contradictions is aggravated by the increasing capacity for temporal compression linked to
              | the latest ICT developments, which distresses many other fractions of capital and puts
              | pressure on the state and other less mobile social forces.
              | Fifth, spatially, there is a tension between extending the scope of markets through the
              | annihilation of space by time and the need for fixed infrastructure to enable rapid movement
              | through space (which must be destroyed in turn as the next round of accumulation develops)
              | (Harvey 1996b: 6). This contradiction may be aggravated by the expansion of production
              | through mechanization and scale economies. Because this requires larger markets, it
              | extends the time of commodity circulation and may also extend the overall turnover time due
              | to the higher proportion of fixed to total capital. It can also lead to a dialectic of spatial
              | concentration (agglomeration economies) and dispersal (congestion, land prices,
              | unionization, etc.) (Schoenberger 1997: 19–21).
              | There are spiral processes at work in the last two contradictions that tend to increase the
              | spatio-temporal complexities of regularizing and governing capital accumulation. ‘Every local
              | decentralization presupposes a renewed form of centralization at a higher level. Every
              | I H S — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — 13
              | temporal flexibilization requires, with increasing complexity, new mechanisms in order to hold
              | the seemingly loosening temporal connections together. Flexibility becomes possible against
              | the background of a previously unattained degree of constant temporal availability, as the
              | prerequisite and consequence of which it functions’ (Nowotny 1994: 99). There are also
              | oscillations in the relative importance of time and space. Thus, whereas mass production
              | compressed time in production, it extended it in product life cycles to valorize dedicated fixed
              | capital and allow for the unmanageability of time required for product development. Now the
              | situation is reversed. The current emphasis is on speeding up product development times
              | and order-to-delivery cycle. This also involves maximum flexibility in organization of
              | production, economies of scope, etc. (Schoenberger 1997: 45).
              | 5. The Implications of Globalization for
              | (National) States
              | Much has been written on the implications of globalization for the possible demise of the
              | national state and/or the national state’s importance for continuing globalization. Such
              | commentaries have been plagued by false oppositions and assumptions. The first false
              | opposition is posited most starkly as that between the state as a ‘power container’ that
              | operates exclusively within defined territorial frontiers and the economy as a borderless
              | exchange mechanism with no important territorial anchoring. This opposition commits four
              | errors in its conception of the state and economy. First, states (and the social forces they
              | represent) are actively involved in constituting and reconstituting the spatio-temporal
              | matrices that organize politics, including its inter-state and international moments (Gross
              | 1985; Poulantzas 1978). Thus there is no reason to assume the fixity of its frontiers or
              | temporal horizons. Second, as form-determined condensations of a changing balance of
              | social forces, state apparatuses and state power will reflect the manifold processes that
              | produce globalization. Thus the state apparatus may interiorize the interests of foreign
              | capital as well as project the interests of national capital abroad (Poulantzas 1975, 1978).
              | Third, the economy should not be reduced to a market-mediated space of flows operating in
              | timeless time: markets also operate in accordance with other spatio-temporalities and the
              | economy more generally involves various non-market governance mechanisms with yet
              | other spatio-temporal dynamics. It follows that the regularization and governance of
              | globalization involves many different scales and temporal horizons. And, fourth, the
              | specificity of many economic assets and their embedding in extra-economic institutions
              | mean that much economic activity remains place- and time-bound. Combining these
              | objections, one could conclude that the state operates as a power connector, i.e., as a nodal
              | or network state within a broader political system (Brunn 1999: 114), as well as a power
              | container; and, likewise, that the economy has important territorial dimensions (reflected in
              | concepts such as industrial districts, agglomeration economies, global cities, and regional or
              | national capitalisms). Thus we should focus on the changing organization of politics and
              | 14 — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — I H S
              | economics and their respective institutional embodiments and see frontiers and borders as
              | actively reproduced and contingent rather than as pregiven and fixed.
              | Another false opposition involves treating the state as a political force and globalization as
              | an economic process with the corollary that their relationship is zero-sum in nature. This
              | ignores how states help to constitute the economy as an object of regulation and the extent
              | to which even economic globalization continues to depend on politics. For the capital relation
              | is constitutively incomplete and needs extra -economic supplementation if the inherently
              | improbable process of accumulation is to continue. States are heavily involved in this
              | supplementation both directly and through their modulation of other extra-economic modes
              | of regulation; and their equally improbable capacity to achieve this depends in part on
              | revenues and resources derived from the accumulation process. In short, state-economy
              | relations inevitably involve reciprocal interdependence, prompt attempts at strategic co-
              | ordination, and produce structural coupling. It cannot be understood in zero-sum terms.
              | Attempts to do so also ignore the complexities of globalization. Not only are many states
              | actively involved in constituting the conditions for globalization, which is multiform and hence
              | contested, but globalization is also linked to processes on other scales, such as
              | regionalization, triadization, international localization, and cross-borderization, and states
              | engage in promoting/resisting these processes too. Finally, zero-sum analyses ignore the
              | extent to which the unfolding economic logic (and illogic) of globalization can constrain firms
              | as well as political actors.
              | This leads us to a third area of conceptual confusion: the claim that globalization puts
              | pressure on the sovereign state. This is misleading for four reasons. First, sovereignty is only
              | one aspect of the form of the modern state. As a specific juridico-political form, sovereignty
              | certainly organizes key features of state power; but it is struggles over state power that are
              | ultimately primary, not the particular forms in which it is exercised. Forms of sovereignty have
              | been reorganized in the past and a post-sovereign international system is imaginable.
              | Second, it is not the State as such (sovereign or otherwise) that is pressured by
              | globalization. The processes that generate globalization can only put pressure on particular
              | forms of state with particular state capacities and liabilities, such as the Keynesian Welfare
              | National State in Atlantic Fordism or the Listian Workfare National State in East Asian
              | Exportism.2 In so doing, it also modifies the balance of forces within states. For any
              | differential loss of capacities will favour some fractions, classes, and social forces over
              | others; it also creates space for, and prompts, struggles to reorganize state forms and
              | capacities. Important aspects of such pressures are the acceleration of economic decision-
              | making and temporal compression of significant economic events relative to the time
              | required for considered political decision-making. This weakens what one might call the ‘time
              | sovereignty’ of the state in its current form. Third, since globalization is not a single causal

              | mechanism with a universal, unitary logic but is multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, and
              | multiform, it does not generate a single, uniform set of pressures. All states and state
              | capacities will be pressured by globalization but each will be affected in different ways.
              | Indeed, while some states actively promote globalization, others can be seen as its victims.
              | Thus, even if one agreed that globalization mainly means Americanization, the ‘Great Satan’
              | would still experience pressures emanating from other centres and forms of globalization as
              | well as from the internal impact of its own neo -liberal form and the resistance it inevitably
              | generates at home and abroad. Similar arguments hold for the differential impact of the
              | multiscalar nature of globalization, with states being differentially involved in various scalar
              | projects and processes; and about that of its multitemporal nature, with some states more
              | actively involved in and/or more vulnerable to time-space distantiation and compression.
              | And, fourth, we should note that some aspects of globalization might actually enhance rather
              | than diminish state capacities.
              | Having clarified possible misconceptions, we can now consider how (national) states are
              | involved in, and affected, by globalization. In broad terms, states are actively engaged in
              | redrawing the spatio-temporal matrices within which capital operates. In doing so, they are
              | trying to manage the tension between potentially mobile capital’s interests in reducing its
              | place-dependency and/or liberating itself from temporal constraints, on the one hand, and,
              | on the other hand, their own interest in fixing (allegedly beneficial)3 capital within their own
              | territories and rendering capital’s temporal horizons and rhythms compatible with their statal
              | and/or political routines, temporalities, and crisis-tendencies. For, as globalization increases,
              | national states can no longer presume, as they did in the heyday of Atlantic Fordism, that
              | their primary economic task is to govern a relatively closed national economy – instead they
              | are increasingly involved in managing a range of transnational processes and creating the
              | spatial and temporal fixes appropriate thereto. Of particular importance here is the changing
              | relationship between the economic and the extra-economic factors bearing on
              | competitiveness and states’ own role in redefining the boundaries between the economic
              | and extra-economic and/or reorganizing the latter and subordinating them to the perceived
              | demands and pressures of globalization. Thus, to take a paradoxical example, even as neo-
              | liberal states seem to disengage from the market economy, they intervene more in the extra-
              | economic field and subordinate it to the demands of valorization.
              | More generally, the activities of capitalist states, almost regardless of their specific form and
              | projects, have been reshaping the spatio-temporal matrices of globalization. Their roles here
              | reflect the balance of internal and external forces, with some more willing and active
              | participants in these processes than others. Nonetheless, among many relevant activities,
              | we can mention: deregulating, liberalizing, and shaping the institutional architecture of
              | 3 Excluded here, for example, might be heavily polluting industries that may be encouraged to relocate – with

              | finance, facilitating thereby its accelerating internationalization and its global acceleration;
              | modifying institutional frameworks for international trade and foreign direct investment;
              | planning and subsidizing the spatial fixes that support the activities of financial, industrial,
              | and commercial capital within and across borders; promoting uneven development through
              | policies for inter-urban and inter -regional as well as international competition; cooperating in
              | the rebordering and rescaling of state functions – including decentralization and cross-border
              | region formation, regional bloc formation, and participating in forums for inter-triad
              | negotiation; de-statizing current state functions by transferring them to private-public
              | partnerships or place-bound market forces and thereby linking them to market -oriented
              | temporalities; de-territorializing some state functions by transferring them to private forms of
              | functional authority (including international regimes) and/or to mobile market forces;
              | attempting, conversely, to fit some non-territorial problems into an areal structure (e.g.,
              | making national states responsible for enforcing international agreements on global
              | warming); and, finally, addressing the multiformity of globalization processes by engaging in
              | the struggle to define the rules for harmonizing or standardizing a wide range of
              | technological, economic, juridico-political, socio-cultural, and environmental issues.
              | More specifically, given the multicentric and multiform nature of globalization, some states
              | are committed to promoting their own national or regional capitalisms and the appropriate
              | conditions for the expanded reproduction of these forms of capitalism on a global scale. The
              | neo-liberal project has, of course, been most successful in this regard in the past two
              | decades; but it has not gone uncontested and the European model in particular may regain
              | ground in the coming decade. They are also establishing new scales of activity (and
              | dismantling others) and thereby rescaling and re-articulating various state powers,
              | institutional forms, and regulatory capacities and creating the possibility for themselves and
              | other actors to ‘jump scales’ in response to specific problems. They are promoting the space
              | of flows by organizing conditions favourable to the international mobility of technologies,
              | industrial and commercial capital, intellectual property, and at least some types of labour
              | power. And, conversely, they are engaged in complementary forms of Standortpolitik and
              | other forms of place-based competition in the attempt to fix mobile capital in their own
              | economic spaces and to enhance the inter-urban, inter-regional, or international
              | competitiveness of their own place-bound capitals.

              | 6. Globalization, Time, and the State
              | An important source of pressure on states comes from the growing complexity of the political
              | economy of time and its implications for politics as the ‘art of the possible’. States
              | increasingly face temporal pressures in their policy-making and implementation due to new
              | forms of time-space distantiation, compression, and differentiation. For, as the temporalities
              | of the economy accelerate relative to those of the state, the time to determine and co-
              | ordinate political responses to economic events shrinks – especially in relation to superfast
              | and/or hypermobile capital. This reinforces conflicts between the time(s) of the state and the
              | time(s) of the market. One solution to the state’s loss of time sovereignty is laissez-faire. This
              | approach reinforces the temporality of deregulated exchange-value, however, which
              | becomes problematic when market forces provoke economic crises and states are expected
              | to respond. Two other options are for states to try to compress their own decision-making
              | cycles so that they can make more timely and appropriate interventions and/or to attempt to
              | decelerate the activities of ‘fast capitalism’ to match existing political routines.
              | A strategy of temporal compression increases pressures to make decisions on the basis of
              | unreliable information, insufficient consultation, lack of participation, etc., even as state
              | managers believe that policy is still taking too long to negotiate, formulate, enact, adjudicate,
              | determine, and implement. The commitment to ‘fast policy’ is reflected in the shortening of
              | policy development cycles, fast-tracking decision-making, rapid programme rollout,
              | continuing policy experimentation, institutional and policy Darwinism, and relentless revision
              | of guidelines and benchmarks. This privileges those who can operate within compressed
              | time scales, narrows the range of participants in the policy process, and limits the scope for
              | deliberation, consultation, and negotiation. This can significantly affect the choice of policies,
              | the initial targets of policy, the sites where policy is implemented, and the criteria adopted to
              | demonstrate success. It also affects whether any lessons learnt are relevant to other targets,
              | sites, or criteria; and it discourages proper evaluation of a policy’s impact over different
              | spatio-temporal horizons, including delayed and/or unintended consequences and feedback
              | effects. In such situations, ‘spin’ trumps substance and modifies the nature of politics and
              | policy-making. It may also help to accelerate policy-making and implementation cycles so
              | that different approaches are tried in rapid succession as each is seen to fail. One symptom
              | of this is the shortening ‘half life’ of legislation and other policies (Scheuerman 2001: 91–2). It
              | also produces the dilemma that unchanged policies become irrelevant or even
              | counterproductive whilst constant changes in policies risk being seen as opportunistic or
              | illegitimate (on the case of law, for example, see de Sousa Santos 1995).
              | Even if fast policy appears irrational from a purely policy-making perspective, it may still be
              | rational for some interests in politics- or polity-making terms. For fast policy is antagonistic to
              | corporatism, stakeholding, the rule of law, formal bureaucracy, and, indeed, to the routines
              | and cycles of democratic politics more generally. It privileges the executive over the
              | 18 — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — I H S
              | legislature and the judiciary, finance over industrial capital, consumption over long -term
              | investment. In general, resort to fast policy undermines the power of decision-makers who
              | have long decision-taking cycles – because they lose the capacity to make decisions in
              | terms of their own routines and procedures, having to adapt to the speed of the fast policy
              | takers. It also tends to destroy institutional memory, on the grounds that new circumstances
              | require new approaches, and to block efforts to anticipate future difficulties and policy
              | failures. Hence the present is extended at the expense of both past and future and politics is
              | lived in the mediatized world of spin and presentation, the quick fix, rapid churning of
              | policies, and plebiscitarian democracy (cf. Chesneaux 2000; Hoogerwoof 1990; Santiso and
              | Schedler 1998; for a possible counter-argument that simplistic, short-term, populist ‘spin’ by
              | a charismatic leader is a useful complement to – or front for – more complex, medium - to
              | long-term, behind-the-scenes policy-making lobbying, negotiation, policy-making, see
              | Grande 2000).
              | An alternative strategy is not to compress absolute political time but to create relative
              | political time by slowing the circuits of capital. Perhaps the most celebrated, if not yet
              | implemented, example of this strategy is the Tobin tax, which would decelerate the flow of
              | superfast and hypermobile financial capital and limit its distorting impact on the real economy
              | (see Jetin and de Brunhoff 2000). Other examples include an energy tax on fossil fuels and
              | nuclear power, consistent introduction of the polluter pays principle on a global scale, resort
              | to a worldwide prudential principle in the introduction of new technologies, and inclusion of
              | recycling and disposal costs in pricing goods (Altvater and Mahnkopf 1999). For these could
              | tilt the balance away from globalization in favour of regional and local economies, slow the
              | rate of environmental destruction, and allow proper evaluation of the likely consequences of
              | technological innovation. This could be supplemented by a fourth political time-management
              | option. This is to establish the institutional framework for subsidiaritarian guided self-
              | regulation on various scales as well as for continuous monitoring of how well such self-
              | regulation is operating in the light of agreed criteria (Scheuerman 2001). This strategy of
              | reflexive metagovernance would enable the state to retain the capacity to co-ordinate
              | activities across different time zones and temporalities without the risk of overload
              | (Hoogerwerf 1990).
              | More generally, on the temporal front, states are getting involved in promoting new temporal
              | horizons of action and new forms of temporal flexibility, in coping with the increased salience
              | of multiple time zones (in commerce, diplomacy, security, etc.), in recalibrating and managing
              | the intersection of temporalities (e.g., regulating computer-programmed trading, promoting
              | the 24-hour city as centre of consumption, managing environmental risk), and socializing
              | long-term conditions of production as short -term calculation becomes more important for
              | marketized economic activities. Of particular importance is the restructuring of welfare
              | regimes to promote flexible economic and social adjustment and socialize its costs as
              | economies become more vulnerable to the cyclical fluctuations and other vagaries of the
              | world market (Jessop 1999b, 1999c). Such a welfare orientation was always a feature of
              | I H S — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — 19
              | small open economies but is now becoming more general. For, ‘[t]he more the welfare state
              | is able to guarantee security and a “future” beyond the market place, the more political space
              | there is to relax closure vis-a-vis world markets’ (Rieger and Leibfried, 1994: 368).
              | 7. Conclusions
              | I will draw two sets of conclusions. The first set concerns globalization and time. I hope to
              | have shown that globalization is not just a spatial or scalar phenomenon; it is also temporal.
              | It is best studied in terms of differential articulation of time -space distantiation and time-
              | space compression and their repercussions on power relations and social dynamics. Indeed,
              | insofar as globalization is linked to the logics of capital accumulation, time is more significant
              | than space – because accumulation rests on ‘economy of time’. Global capitalism weakens
              | national states through its adverse impact on their claims to time sovereignty as well as to
              | territorial sovereignty. This suggests the need to reorganize the spatio-temporal fixes within
              | which moments of relative structural coherence and stability can occur through the
              | displacement and/or deferral of certain of the contradictions and dilemmas of capitalism
              | beyond the spatio-temporal horizons with which that fix is associated. But it also means that
              | there can never be global stability or an unlimited process of global accumulation in an
              | undifferentiated world market. For spatio-temporal pockets of stable capital accumulation
              | rests on specific spatio-temporal fixes. This is never a global stability – it is always
              | spatialized, temporalized, and differential. This in turn implies that attempts to control the
              | globalization of the capital relation entail control over its temporalities as well as its
              | spatialities. As well as thinking global, acting local, we must also think glacial, act everyday.
              | This brings me to the second set of conclusions, concerning the role of the state in
              | constituting these socio-spatial fixes and managing the temporalities as well as spatialities of
              | capital accumulation. The national state has long played a key role in establishing and
              | regulating the relationship between the spatial and the temporal matrices of social life
              | (Poulantzas, 1978: 114). This remains true in a period of globalization but the forms in which
              | the state is involved therein have been changing. For the state is involved in modifying the
              | spatio-temporal matrices of capitalism and the nation; and it has a key role in managing the
              | uneven spatio-temporal development engendered by the capital relation. In many significant
              | respects the processes that produce globalization have undermined the effectiveness of the
              | national state (in its postwar forms) because specific powers and capacities have become
              | less relevant to the new spatio-temporal matrices, the reversal of the relative significance of
              | wages as cost of production and source of demand and of money as national money and
              | international currency as these functioned in Atlantic Fordism, and the increased significance
              | of competition and state forms as sites of contradictions and dilemmas in a globalizing,
              | knowledge-driven economy (see Jessop 2002). Nonetheless a restructured national state
              | remains central to the effective management of the emerging spatio-temporal matrices of
              | 20 — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — I H S
              | capitalism and the emerging forms of post- or transnational citizenship to be seen in multi-
              | ethnic, multicultural, melting pot, tribal, cosmopolitan, ‘playful’ pos tmodern, and other
              | identities. For national states have become even more important arbiters of the movement of
              | state powers upwards, downwards, and sideways; they have become even more important
              | meta-governors of the increasingly complex multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, and
              | multiform world of governance; and they are actively involved in shaping the forms of
              | international policy regimes. They are also responding to the crisis in traditional forms and
              | bases of national citizenship. Their activities in these respects have far less to do with
              | globalization in the strongest sense of this polyvalent, promiscuous, and controversial word
              | (i.e., the emergence of a borderless planetary economy – an entity widely and rightly
              | regarded as mythical) than they do with the more general spatio-temporal restructuring of
              | contemporary capitalism. This is why my own discussion of globalization has focused on the
              | complex spatio-temporal logics of globalization and their manifold implications for state
              | power. In doing so I hope to have contributed in a small way to demystifying globalization
              | and illustrating the ways in which its associated spatio-temporal transformations can be
              | modified and controlled.
