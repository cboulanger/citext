              | Health issues and medical science receive a lot of attention on television. Of all
              | the sciences, the European public is most interested in medicine, and the public
              | uses television as their main source of information on science. There has been
              | hardly any empirical research, however, into the historical development of the rep-
              | resentation of medical science on television. The development of medical televi-
              | sion was explored by carrying out a content analysis of Dutch non-fiction medical
              | television programs spanning a period of 40 years. The speaking time allotted to
              | experts has decreased over the years, while that allotted to laypeople has
              | increased. We are seeing fewer references to sources and science and more expres-
              | sion of emotion and tension. The results suggest three periods of medical televi-
              | sion: a scientific, a journalistic and a lay period. Medical television in 2000 shows
              | a personified picture of patients against an instrumentalized and symbolized med-
              | ical backdrop.
              | 1. Introduction
              | In Europe and the United States, health issues and medical science receive a lot of attention on
              | television compared to that devoted to other sciences (Göpfert, 1996; Lafollette, 2002;
              | Cheveigné, 2006). Of all the sciences, the European public is also most interested in medicine, and
              | they use television as their main source of information on science (European Commission, 2001). As
              | television plays such an important role in the way the public gathers information, it would seem to
              | be important to know how science is represented there, especially since the public debate is drawing
              | attention to the increasing tension between the dumbing-down of media content and the increasing
              | complexity of science and daily life (cf. Dawkins, 1998; Hargreaves and Ferguson, 2001). The
              | debate suggests that media content has changed over the years. Has media content relating to science
              | changed over time, or is the suggestion based more on myths about media content and the power of
              | the media (Schönbach, 2000) than on empirical reality?
              | There has been hardly any empirical research into the historical development of television
              | content and science (Dawkins, 1998; Loughlin, 2000; Allan, 2002). A study was therefore con-
              | ducted to ascertain whether the use of science on Dutch television changed from 1960 to 2000,
              | and if so, how. This study was carried out against the background of the above-mentioned public
              | debate on the dumbing-down of media content, as well as against the background of social theory
              | about the logic of the mass media and their role and position in society.

              | In some social theoretical perspectives, the development of the media is presented as the
              | core of the cultural transformation into the modern society (Thompson, 1995), and is closely
              | related to the development of science and technology. Thompson calls the development of the
              | media the “mediazation of culture,” by which patterns of communication and interaction have
              | changed in “profound and irreversible ways” (1995: 46). By now, mediazation also includes
              | the rise of “media logic” (Altheide and Snow, 1979, 1991; van Vree et al., 2003), in which the
              | mass media mainly take an entertainment perspective on social and political life, and when
              | information is presented. The concept of mediazation was used as a background in this study
              | in order to examine the historical development of the representation of science on television.
              | Mediazation was chosen instead of mediatization because mediazation refers primary to cul-
              | tural processes and mediatization seems to become more and more defined as a concept used
              | to describe the penetration of mass media and their logic into other social systems, e.g. orga-
              | nizations in society (Kepplinger, 2002; Schulz, 2004; Schrott, 2005). This mediatization is not
              | the focus of this study.
              | Medical science and medical journalism
              | In this media analysis, medicine is taken as exemplary of the development of the representation
              | of science on television over time. This is for several reasons. First, because of its presence
              | in the media, the importance the public attaches to it and the image medical science has as
              | being exemplary of science in general. Inhabitants of the European Union also think that med-
              | ical science is the most scientific compared to other sciences (European Commission, 2001).
              | This confirms earlier research conducted in the United Kingdom (Durant et al., 1992) and
              | Canada (Einsiedel, 1992) that showed that medicine dominates the general image the public
              | has of science. This suggests that at least for a part of the public, medicine is paradigmatic for
              | science in general. The image of science in general is determined by the familiarity with and
              | the image of medical science. As Einsiedel (1992) has said, a typical story about science is a
              | story about medical science, is based on scientific expertise and is a positive occurrence, often
              | a medical innovation or a treatment.
              | Second, when measuring the attention devoted to science and technology, medical
              | journalism can be positioned between general news journalism and science journalism. On the
              | general television news, not much attention is paid to science or technology (León, 2004). In
              | special science programs on television as a part of science journalism the situation is the oppo-
              | site: science and technology are very visible because the broadcasts usually are entirely devoted
              | to science. It can be expected that medical journalism will be positioned somewhere in between.
              | The above considerations seem to make medical journalism suitable for observing
              | changes over time.
              | 2. Theoretical background
              | The background to the study was the theoretical debate on and arguments concerning the
              | scientification and mediazation of culture and society. If we look at the development of
              | science we find it has determined not only the technological processes, economic systems and
              | social structures of society but also our everyday experience of the world and conscious
              | thoughts and even unconscious feelings. It is presented as the driving force behind modern-
              | ization (Nowotny et al., 2001), determining every aspect of society. Processes of “scientifica-
              | tion” and “socialization” have led to a science and society that are fundamentally interwoven
              | (cf. Hagendijk, 1996, 2004) and the co-production of a scientificized culture.
              | Verhoeven: Mediazation of medicine 463
              | If we look at the development of the mass media, we find a great deal of attention has
              | been devoted to the role and logic of the media and to the “mediazation of culture”
              | (Thompson, 1995: 46). This has resulted in the transformation of the public sphere, which
              | now takes the form more of a mediated publicness than a non-mediated agora for dialogue
              | and debate. Social and political life has become nothing more than a struggle for visibility in
              | the mass media. Mediazation has entered upon a new phase in recent decades, referred to as
              | “extended mediazation” (Thompson, 1995: 110–11): the media have developed a “relatively
              | high degree of self-referentiality” (Thompson, 1995: 110). Media messages refer more often
              | to other media messages and to events reported in the media.
              | “Media logic” is said to have replaced the classical journalistic way of working (Altheide
              | and Snow, 1979, 1991; van Vree et al., 2003). It consists of formats for the symbolic repro-
              | duction of events; when it is applied, the form of the communication takes precedence over its
              | content. These formats determine how the material is organized and in what style it is pre-
              | sented. They reflect underlying, often implicit rules that apply to the whole media industry,
              | although there are different formats for different subjects, for example for news, entertainment,
              | sports and talk shows. They provide the grammar for media content, they arrange actions and
              | events, provide temporality and produce symbols that express emotion or are meant to evoke
              | emotions. They are dominated by the “entertainment perspective” (Altheide and Snow, 1979),
              | aiming at entertaining the public instead of informing them. Information presented in an
              | entertainment format is sometimes referred to as “infotainment” (Brants, 1998; Wieten, 2002).
              | News values and news factors
              | Empirical research into the content of news has shown that this development towards media
              | logic and the self-referentiality of the media started as early as the 1950s. Much research has
              | shown that media content is consistent and that this content mainly can be explained by the
              | working of the so-called news values and news factors. Following the classical study by
              | Galtung and Ruge (1965), many researchers have worked on extending the news value theory.
              | For example, Schulz (1976, 1982) has shown that the content of the news and its production
              | are not what one would expect on the basis of the professional norms and ideals of journalists.
              | Important news factors are:
              | ● Threshold: the news is about topics that exceed a certain threshold of intensity to be
              | noticed by journalists.
              | ● Unambiguity: the news often presents matters as unambiguous.
              | ● Consonance: the news is consonant with what journalists and the public have in their minds.
              | ● Status: the news is about elite people, nations and institutes.
              | ● Dynamics: the news presents the world as constantly changing.
              | ● Valence: the news is about success or conflicts.
              | ● Identification: the news often presents people who evoke compassion.
              | ● Personification: the news is about people with whom the public can identify, people in
              | action and people’s emotions.
              | Television in the Netherlands
              | The historical development of television journalism has also been described as a process
              | towards the increasing use of media logic. In the 1950s and 1960s, television used models
              | taken from the movies, followed by one derived from the press until about 1985. From then
              | on it started using more and more formats with the characteristics of media logic. Not only
              | 464 Public Understanding of Science 17(4)
              | the rise of commercial television but also technological developments are held responsible for
              | this (Wijfjes, 2002).
              | The Netherlands was one of the last countries in Europe to introduce commercial television
              | (Bakker and Scholten, 2005). Until 1989, Dutch television was public television only. All broad-
              | casters were non-profit organizations. In 1989, commercial television was introduced parallel to
              | the public broadcasting system. Today, the Netherlands has three public broadcasting channels
              | and eight national commercial channels (Bakker and Scholten, 2005)
              | The mediazation hypothesis
              | The question is how the representation of science on television has developed. Has the use of
              | science—medical science in this case—on television changed during the past decades, and if
              | so, how? Or, to put it differently, have the narratives and knowledge of journalists taken over
              | from those of scientists and experts in medical television programs, because of increasing
              | media logic? The study started out from the mediazation hypothesis, which states that the nar-
              | ratives and knowledge of journalists have become more present in the media over the years
              | than those of scientists and experts.
              | 3. Methodology
              | Medical journalism
              | In order to answer the research question, a content analysis of a sample of medical documentaries
              | from the public broadcasting organizations in the Netherlands was carried out. It was decided
              | to analyze only non-fiction medical television shows, because this genre of medical television
              | was broadcast throughout almost the entire research period. Although fictional medical tele-
              | vision programs are also relevant, such programs were not broadcast in the Netherlands until
              | the late 1980s. Furthermore, quite a lot of research on medical drama series has already been
              | done (e.g. van Dijck, 2002; Kirby, 2003), in contrast to the amount on medical programs with
              | a predominantly informational character and aim.
              | Sample frame and sample
              | It emerged from the archives of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision that from the
              | start of Dutch television in 1951 until 2000 over 40 different medical series were produced
              | and broadcast, starting in 1961. This is such a broad and varied universe that a random sam-
              | ple was not suitable for the study. In order to make the historical analysis as internally valid
              | as possible, a sampling frame was devised. This sampling frame was made up of a group of
              | seven consecutive medical television series between 1961 and 2000.1 From this sampling
              | frame a proportionate stratified sample (Neuendorf, 2002) was drawn of two episodes per
              | year. The resulting sample contained 76 different episodes from 38 different years, with a
              | total length of 34 hours, 30 minutes and 34 seconds.
              | Operationalization, procedure and analysis
              | Media content was analyzed at the level of (a) entire episodes and (b) statements, using a con-
              | structed media reference model. This model has two dimensions.
              | The first dimension—referentiality—consists of variables that measure references to
              | sources, references to the rules of science, the educational character of the statements and the
              | speaking times (following Adatto, 1990) allotted to the persons appearing in the programs. The
              | operationalization of the reference to rules of science is based on the Mertonian imperatives
              | Verhoeven: Mediazation of medicine 465
              | (Merton, 1942), usually abbreviated to CUDOS,2 giving rise to such variables as reference to
              | communality of knowledge, reference to former knowledge, reference to universality and
              | causality, and reference to scientific research in statements.
              | The second dimension—news factors and media factors—consists of variables that
              | measure the visibility of these factors, as previously defined by Galtung and Ruge (1965) and
              | Schulz (1976, 1982). News factors can be considered the most important forms of expression
              | in the mediazation process. The concept of news factors gives rise to such variables as thresh-
              | old and continuity, thematization, elite persons and elite institutions, dynamics, valence (with
              | success on the positive side and tension on the negative side), identification, emotion, per-
              | sonification, contextualization, mentioning of wider implications and presentation of events
              | as surprising. Also such variables as the visibility of medical clothing and accoutrements, the
              | discipline (humanities, hard sciences or social sciences) of the speakers in the episodes, the
              | storyline, the use of metaphor, speaking directly or indirectly, images presented on the screen,
              | mentioning of risks and moderation of the programs were part of the dimension of news and
              | media factors.
              | In total, 31 variables were encoded. Eight variables were coded at whole-episode level,
              | including the speaking times allotted to various persons. This was only possible for the 1976 to
              | 2000 period, owing to the availability of episodes; before 1976 the broadcasting organizations
              | did not record whole episodes, but only archived filmed reports.
              | After coding the variables of the whole episode, each episode was divided into a
              | sequence of statements. A “statement” is the number of seconds during which a person talks
              | before he or she is interrupted. In total, 7,242 different statements were identified in programs
              | in the period 1961–2000. A total of 24 variables were coded at the statement level.
              | All the variables and their possible values were defined and described in a code book. Four
              | coders encoded the data. A reliability subsample of 10 percent of the statements was drawn to
              | calculate Scott’s pi (π) (Lombard et al., 2002), which was calculated for the variables encoded
              | at statement level. The inter-coder reliability ranged from 0 to .98.
              | Given the research question, the speaking times allotted to persons were aggregated
              | annually. Time series were produced from these aggregated data to enable patterns over the
              | years to be observed.3 To support the interpretation of the patterns a bivariate regression
              | analysis was carried out. In order to enable variables to be compared the standardized regres-
              | sion coefficient (β) was reported. In addition to the bivariate regression analysis a one-way
              | ANOVA was conducted to explore significant differences in content in different time periods.
              | 4. Results
              | Seven consecutive medical series were analyzed, those connected to three television doctors
              | (Dr. van Swol, Dr. Haneveld, Dr. Gisolf) in the 1960s and 1970s, and Vinger aan de pols
              | (“Finger on the Pulse”) in the period 1981–2000. Vinger was the dominant medical program
              | in the Netherlands at the time. It was anchored by medical journalist Ria Bremer, first in
              | cooperation with television doctor Dr. Lens and later (after 1987) alone.
              | Speaking time
              | An important indicator of the way medical science is represented on television is the speaking
              | time allotted to the various participants in the programs. Non-fiction medical television programs
              | show more than seventeen different groups of participants, falling into three categories: experts,
              | journalists and laypersons.
              | 466 Public Understanding of Science 17(4)
              | In order to distinguish between different kinds of experts and the different roles experts
              | can play, the participants in the category experts were encoded into three different subcate-
              | gories: pure scientists, other experts (medical and otherwise) and medical doctors. The total
              | speaking time of all these experts together decreased over time. Medical doctors, in different
              | roles, have by far the largest share of the speaking time of experts, followed by pure scientists.
              | The second category—journalists—also plays various roles in the programs, for example as
              | moderators or as on-location reporters or commentators. In the third category are laypersons,
              | such as patients and their families and representatives of patient groups and of the general public.
              | Figure 1 shows the speaking times observed in the three categories (i.e. experts, journalists
              | and laypeople) between 1976 and 2000. From 1976 to 2000 relative speaking times among the
              | three categories changed greatly. The speaking time allotted to experts decreased significantly
              | over this period (β = –.373, p < .10) and that allotted to laypersons increased (β = .357, p < .10).
              | The speaking time allotted to journalists did not change significantly from 1976 to 2000 (β =
              | .267, not significant). The pattern of the changes enables three periods to be identified. The first
              | was from 1976 to 1980, when experts had the most speaking time (54.7 percent). Television
              | doctors (in the roles of anchorman and doctor) moderated the programs and invited medical spe-
              | cialists and patients and other laypeople (38.9 percent of speaking time) to speak. Journalists
              | (6.4 percent of speaking time) performed a supporting role as on-location reporters and occa-
              | sionally as commentators. Between 1981 and 1987 the pattern changed, with a markedly
              | increased role for journalists. In spite of visible cooperation with television doctors, journalists
              | acquired a larger share of speaking time (36.6 percent). Experts had a smaller share of speaking
              | time (31.3 percent) and from 1981 onwards the broadcasts no longer featured experts in the role
              | of scientists. Visible cooperation between television doctors and journalists ceased by 1987,
              | when doctors stopped playing an anchor role: from then on this was performed only by jour-
              | nalists. This period marks the beginning of a new era of speaking time distribution, which sta-
              | bilized further in the third period, from 1988 to 2000: speaking time allotted to experts
              | decreased even more (21.9 percent) in favor of laypeople (46.1 percent).
              | Content of the episodes
              | At episode level, we identified some significant changes in the content of medical television, as
              | shown in Figure 2. The presentation of topics in an impersonal context decreased (β = –.595,
              | p < .001): after 1988, 80 percent of the topics in medical programs were discussed in a personal
              | context. Stories were more often personified in the form of specific laypersons, patients and
              | their families, and less often in generalized stereotypes with which the public could identify.
              | This is underlined by the decrease in the number of children in the programs as an identifier for
              | the public (β = –.438, p < .05). Also, topics were less often discussed in a general way, leaving
              | aside the major or minor implications for certain people: not mentioning implications decreased
              | significantly (β = –.697, p < .001). This coincided with a decreasing proportion of non-thema-
              | tized episodes (β = –.737, p < .001). Gradually more attention was devoted to familiar subjects
              | and persons, with increasing thematization (β = .367, p < .10).
              | The threshold for gaining attention with medical television programs has increased for
              | basic health problems (everyday topics): interest in these problems has decreased significantly
              | (β = –.595, p < .001) over time.
              | Many of the subjects dealt with in the programs that were produced in the 1960s/1970s
              | are basic health problems: most attention is paid to such matters as pregnancy and childbirth,
              | followed by dental care, accidents involving children, illness and holidays, allergies, venereal
              | diseases, puberty and so on. Besides these basic health problems, attention is also paid to
              | cancer and to heart and vascular diseases.

              | programs, 1976–2000.
              | The 1980s gave rise to a dichotomy between attention to basic health problems and increas-
              | ing attention to such matters as cancer, heart and vascular diseases and organ transplants—
              | areas in which first-class clinical care and technological solutions play an important role. The
              | majority of the post-1988 programs are about diseases that need first-class clinical care or
              | new and specialized treatments, such as cancer, heart diseases, AIDS, Huntington’s disease
              | and Alzheimer’s disease.
              | Content of the statements
              | Table 1 summarizes some primary outcomes of the content analysis of statements made by
              | participants in medical television programs from 1961 to 2000. The content has changed over
              | time, as can be seen from the differences in the three periods of speaking time identified.4
              | Until 1988, the statements analyzed included explicit verbal references to sources and
              | science, operationalized as mentioning sources and speaking about the results or the back-
              | grounds of scientific research, mentioning the validity and the foundation of the claims made
              | in the statement, and referring to previous confirmed knowledge about the subject spoken
              | about in the statement. After 1988 this was far less the case: reference to sources decreased
              | significantly (β = –.055, p < .001) over the whole period, as did verbal references to science
              | (β = –.097, p < .001, shown in Figure 3).5
              | There was also a decrease in the number of statements explaining medical problems or
              | illnesses (β = –.039, p < .001). The number of educational statements was highest from 1970
              | to 1990; the content of educational statements also changed after 1988, away from the preven-
              | tion and explanation of illnesses towards mainly explaining medical treatments. In addition,
              | the manner in which explanations were given changed, from medical lectures on television in

              | the 1960s and 1970s to seminars with public participation in the 1980s; after 1988 the focus
              | was on stories about personal experiences of patients and their families, with explanations
              | generally kept implicit. This coincided with an increasing number of statements in medical
              | programs where experts spoke indirectly, that is, not addressing the public or the journalist
              | directly but being shown talking to patients and families in the consultation room or during
              | surgery in the operating theatre.
              | Also the number of unambiguous statements increased significantly after 1988. Although
              | there has never been much ambiguity in medical television programs, it has further diminished
              | since 1988.
              | Furthermore, medical experts were presented as merely tools for the treatment of patients
              | or symbols of the medical or scientific field. After 1988 experts were more often shown wear-
              | ing medical clothing (β = .102, p < .001) and with other medical accoutrements on screen
              | (β = .108, p < .001). The tension and emotion in the programs mounted over time. The pro-
              | portion of statements articulating conflicts and disagreements increased significantly (β =
              | .031, p < .01), especially after 1981, as did the proportion of statements expressing emotions
              | (β = .031, p < .01). Lastly, there was an increasing sense of instability and drama in the
              | programs: patients’ conditions were increasingly presented as rapidly changing, as can be
              | seen from the growing proportion of statements articulating some kind of unpredictable
              | change (β = .112, p < .001).
              | 5. Conclusions and discussion
              | The study shows that the way medical science is represented and used in the Dutch media
              | changed from 1961 to 2000. There has been an unmistakable tendency towards mediazation.
              | The change seems to be more complex than the mediazation hypothesis suggests, however: it
              | is not a matter of science simply being replaced by journalism. The historical trend shows that
              | the roles of the various participants in the programs have changed, starting with a change
              | 470 Public Understanding of Science 17(4)
              | in the distribution of the available speaking time, which shows what, on the basis of the
              | mediazation hypothesis, is an unexpected development in the role and position of laypeople.
              | The speaking time of laypeople has increased significantly and the speaking time of experts
              | has decreased significantly.
              | Three different periods were identified on the basis of the observations. The first, from
              | 1976 to 1980, could be called the “scientific period,” as the speaking time ratio favors experts.
              | The content analysis of statements indicates that this scientific era started earlier, in 1961. In
              | the second period, from 1981 to 1987, journalists took over the anchor role in medical
              | programs, hence it could be labeled the “journalistic period.” This marks the beginning of a
              | new distribution in which the speaking time allotted to experts decreased in favor of laypeo-
              | ple. This new distribution intensified and stabilized in the third period, from 1988 to 2000,
              | which could be termed the “lay period.”
              | In the 1980s, journalists started to take the lead in and to give direction to medical television
              | programs. Why this change took place cannot be derived from the content of the programs.
              | On the basis of the content of the programs, it seems that the “factuality regime” in the
              | programs has changed from a medical science one via a journalistic one to a lay one. A fac-
              | tuality regime is defined by Hagendijk (1996: 186) as a “collection of assumptions, goals,
              | impressions and rules which play a role in the production and evaluation of factual claims.”
              | These journalistic and lay factuality regimes increasingly mask science rules in favor of
              | an instrumentalized and symbolized image of experts, generally painting a picture of medical
              | science as a mere tool. To put it another way, science has become technology, more or less
              | simplistically presented as a scenic backdrop to the lives of laypeople. This observation
              | matches the way news factors function: several of these converged, especially after 1988, in
              | the direction of personifying laypeople. The speaking layperson is more often a recognizable
              | person with a personal tale that is followed over a lengthy period of time. This trend is in line
              | with the “layification” of speaking time in the programs.
              | This layification of the speaking time might be explained by the transformation in the
              | patient–doctor relationship that occurred between 1961 and 2000, and the rise of patient
              | activist groups and activism around specific diseases like AIDS (Epstein, 1996) or controver-
              | sies about treatments (Kent, 2003) or medicine (Andsager and Smiley, 1998). Those contex-
              | tual developments cannot be derived from this content analysis, although an increase in
              | speaking time for patient groups or representatives of activists was not found in this study.
              | A number of other news factors, however, have developed in a way that diverges from the
              | personification of laypeople: for instance, less attention is devoted to everyday medical prob-
              | lems, and after 1988 the television stories of laypeople were increasingly characterized by
              | change, emotions and conflicts. This indicates that a journalistic regime was also present in
              | the lay period, which constructs a narrative of personified laypeople, told in terms of news
              | factors: dynamics, valence, unambiguity and emotion.
              | This feature of media content in the lay period illustrates what we might call the paradox
              | of the layification of medical television: the lives of laypeople are not actually at issue, nor is
              | their everyday knowledge and context, which—in the journalistic factuality regime—are of
              | importance only as long as they are compatible with the news factors. This also results in
              | experts playing a supporting role in the journalistic tale as tools and symbols of the medical
              | science world.
              | The study shows the historical development of the content of medical television
              | programs in the direction of infotainment (Brants, 1998) and entertainment. References to
              | science have not completely disappeared, but they are more implicit and symbolical. This
              | trend could be the result of the introduction of commercial television in the Netherlands, which
              | began in 1989. The Dutch public broadcasting organizations may have anticipated this by
              | Verhoeven: Mediazation of medicine 471
              | changing the content of the programs more in the direction of infotainment and entertainment.
              | This anticipation of the rise of commercial television corresponds theoretically with the his-
              | torical development of television journalism, described as a process towards increasing use of
              | media logic (Wijfjes, 2002; Altheide and Snow, 1979).
              | Medical journalism on television in 2000 paints a personified and instrumentalized pic-
              | ture of the scientificized society, without problematizing or explaining science explicitly. The
              | scientification aspects and construction processes of medical science are increasingly
              | expressed only implicitly or ignored.
              | The observed development of medical television towards infotainment and entertainment
              | shows a picture of a taken for granted, almost consumerist use of medical experts, medical
              | scientists and medical scientific knowledge. Such a one-dimensional media image of science
              | and health care as an instrument does not do justice to the complex interrelation of science
              | and society. Finally, in terms of social effects the question can be raised about the effect that
              | this way of presenting medicine and health care on television has had and still has on the
              | public. This is a question for further research.
              | Notes
              | 1 The seven non-fiction medical series were: Ziek zijn, Beter worden (1961–5), Medische Kroniek (1968–9),
              | Spreekuur (1969–70), Op uw gezondheid (1971–4), Dokter ja, Dokter nee (1975), Artsenij (1976–81), and Vinger
              | aan de Pols (1981–2000).
              | 2 CUDOS is short for communality, universality, disinterestedness and organized skepticism.
              | 3 The time series in Figures 1, 2 and 3 were done using a T4253H smoothing filter in order to enable trends to be
              | recognized and for reasons of presentation. The smoothing technique levels off fluctuations but leaves the original
              | time series trend unchanged.
              | 4 The first period is now 1961–80.
              | 5 Verbal reference to science is an index of four variables referring to science rules: communality, universality, refer-
              | ence to scientific research and reference to former knowledge, ranging from 0 (no reference) to 4 (high reference).
