              | Selfless Time
              | From life space to death anticipation
              | Bertrand Urien
              | ABSTRACT. Time studies in psychology or in consumer behaviour,
              | traditionally think of the personal future as a Lewinian ‘life space’,
              | containing several well-known time dimensions: future time per-
              | spective, future anxiety, and hope. Those dimensions are used to test
              | the predictive power of various behaviours (attitudinal change,
              | health behaviour, delay of gratification, etc.) or more specifically:
              | the temporality of consumer behaviours as implied in consumption
              | of cultural goods, exploratory consumer behaviour, or mail order
              | purchasing. However, the personal future is flexible enough to
              | enable individuals to project themselves well beyond this ‘life space’
              | into a post-mortem future. In this context, I propose to look at the
              | concept of death anxiety. Researchers studying the influence of time
              | representations on human behaviour should not limit themselves to
              | apprehending the traditional dimension of personal future; they
              | could integrate an understanding of the future that projects us beyond
              | physical death. This requires first a close examination of the rela-
              | tionships between death anxiety and the traditionally applied future
              | dimensions, and then broadening the scope to various human and
              | consumer behaviours still unexplained by traditionally acknowl-
              | edged temporal dimensions. I first present the classical Lewinian
              | notion of personal future, highlighting some of its aspects, to show
              | how death anxiety is part of the personal future, and presents major
              | behavioural impacts. Second, by using structural equation model-
              | ling, and a multi-group approach, I present an empirical study aiming
              | to show the nature and the intensity of the links between death
              | anxiety and the other traditionally applied dimensions. KEY

              | Introduction
              | ‘Temporal consciousness cannot be divorced from the awareness of death.’
              | With this phrase, Clay Routledge and Jamie Arndt (2005) draw our attention to
              | the potential contiguity of two fundamental human faculties, thinking about time
              | and death anticipation. The aim of this article is to integrate death anticipation in
              | the conceptual structure of our time experience. Close relations between death
              | and time have already been demonstrated. For example, Held and Nützinger
              | (1998) and Sabelis (2002) discuss the dominance of ‘clock time’ as the ultimate
              | mode for conjuration of finitude. However, if we want to expand our scope
              | beyond relations with ‘clock time’, we should envisage death with other forms
              | of time experience, also qualified by perception, perspective or temporal
              | orientation.1 Very early, the French philosopher Guyau (1890) considered time
              | as a product of the consciousness and wrote that the past and the future are
              | represented. In keeping with the tradition of Lewin (1942), psychologists and
              | social psychologists such as Fraisse (1967), Nuttin (1980), Raynor and Entin
              | (1982), have contributed considerably to the structuring and the knowledge in
              | this field of research. Moreover, among the three temporal zones, the future has
              | been the object of specific research (Bouffard, 1993; Zaleski, 1996, 2005), as
              | much as on the means of apprehending and living it cognitively and emotionally
              | as on its behavioural impact (Strathman and Joireman, 2005). But what future
              | are we discussing? Since the works of Lewin (1942), most works traditionally
              | think of the personal future as a Lewinian ‘life space’ (Bergadaà, 1990;
              | Strathman and Joireman 2005). In psychology for example, this ‘life space’ con-
              | tains several well-known dimensions that are used to test the predictive power of
              | various behaviours (attitude change, health behaviour, delay of gratification,
              | etc.). In marketing and consumer behaviour, other behaviours are tested
              | (consumption of cultural goods, exploratory consumer behaviour, mail order
              | purchasing, etc.). Yet, Boyd and Zimbardo (1997) strayed onto another path by
              | integrating what happens in the afterlife into their reflection about time. Adam
              | and Groves (2007) outline the importance of the encounters with death to ‘tame
              | the future’. Finally, Routledge and Arndt (2005: 59) add that, ‘Being able to
              | think about the future means being able to think about a future without us in it.’
              | In keeping with the works of these authors, this article proposes to integrate
              | death anticipation, and more specifically death anxiety, into the structure of
              | one’s personal future. On the individual level, this new integration requests first
              | a close examination of the relationships between death anxiety and the tradi-
              | tional dimensions of the future, and should then broaden the scope of under-
              | standing of various human and consumer behaviours still unexplained by
              | traditional temporal dimensions. If the behavioural impact of death anxiety has
              | already been studied both in psychology (Tomer and Eliason, 1996) and con-
              | sumer behaviour (Bonsu and Belk, 2003; Urien, 2003), there rarely have been
              | URIEN: SELFLESS TIME
meta          | 369
text          | works addressing the topic in terms of time studies. Yet, it is important that
              | researchers studying the influence of time representations on human behaviour,
              | and consumer behaviour, should not limit themselves to apprehending the
              | traditional dimensions of the personal future but integrate also the future which
              | projects us beyond our physical death.
              | This research firstly presents the classical Lewinian notion of personal future,
              | highlights some of its aspects, shows how death anxiety is part of the personal
              | future, and presents some of the major behavioural impacts. Second, by using
              | structural equation modelling, and a multi-group approach, we present an
              | empirical study aiming to show the nature and the intensity of the links between
              | death anxiety and other dimensions of temporal orientation.
              | Death Anxiety: Personal Future and Selfless Anticipation
              | ‘Man is the only animal aware of his own mortality. Without the awareness of
              | one’s own finiteness, there can be no consciousness of one’s past – no remorse,
              | nor nostalgia – and no consciousness of one’s future – in other words, no
              | consciousness of time’ (Piettre, 1994: 117, author’s translation). Paul Fraisse, an
              | eminent psychologist of time, wrote that philosophical reflection had preceded
              | scientific reflection on a number of issues, and that this process was certainly
              | still underway. After presenting the work of several philosophers on the links
              | between death awareness and the representation of time, I will argue how death
              | anxiety can be integrated into the network of the personal future.
              | Death awareness and personal future
              | The subjective experience of time and, more specifically, the representation
              | humankind has constructed of time, has been one of philosophy’s favourite
              | topics. Nonetheless, the variety of ways in which philosophy grasps time should
              | prompt us to caution. It led Pélicier (cited in Sutter, 1983) to write that all
              | philosophers have dealt with time without giving any definite answers, since
              | none of them talk about the same thing. He continues by stating that they are
              | only philosophers in one particular moment and grasp time on the basis of their
              | own personal issues that depend on their own life stories and status. While
              | time is thought of as a ‘dilation of the soul’ by St Augustine or as an ‘intimate
              | consciousness’ by Husserl, it is a space of possibilities and action projects for
              | Heidegger (1927/1986). According to Heidegger, ‘authentic’ time is the open-
              | ended time of projects; it is the characteristic of human reality to be projected
              | before one’s own situation. Our relation to time is determined by the tragic fate
              | of our personal future and the awareness that our future’s limitation, that is, of
              | the more or less 700,000 hours theoretically at our disposal. ‘Authentic time’ is
meta          | 370

              | not constructed by the individual alone but is rather the result of his/her aware-
              | ness of his/her own death: human existence is finite and it is precisely the
              | ‘anticipation of one’s own finiteness’, the co-presence of death – source of
              | existential anxiety – that reveals the future, a temporal perspective full of possi-
              | bilities and plans. French philosopher Marcel Conche (1980: 71) wrote: ‘Death
              | is my fate. So be it. I anticipate it. I refuse to wait until time passes and let the
              | future come to me. I anticipate the future; I decide what it will be; I determine it’
              | (author’s translation). Confronted with the ‘destined power’ of time, several
              | reactions are possible. Conche suggests that there are several types of illusions
              | that make it possible to forget about one’s mortality: the ‘religious illusion’
              | opens up the hope of life after death; the ‘moral illusion’ awards hope of
              | eternity on the basis of merit; the ‘social illusion’ works, thanks to prestige,
              | fame, consideration and glory; the ‘ontological illusion’ relies on possessions
              | and the ‘apparent consistency of reality’ (author’s translation); finally, with the
              | ‘practical illusion’, oblivion is granted, thanks to action: by focusing on my task,
              | action makes me forget my own mortality. Thus, from a metaphysical point of
              | view, death awareness is not only a cornerstone of our awareness of time, but it
              | also generates behaviours aiming at supporting or abolishing finiteness.
              | Personal future: From life space to death anxiety
              | Ever since Lewin, the personal future is considered as a possible extension of
              | one’s life space. Lewin writes that life space is extended during what he calls
              | ‘the psychological time dimension’. The psychological time dimension of one’s
              | life space increases from hours, days and months up to years. In other words,
              | young children live in the immediate present. As they age, an evermore distant
              | psychological past and future affects their present behaviours. Psychologists of
              | time, such as Fraisse (1967), Nuttin (1980), Bouffard (1993), Zaleski (1997,
              | 2005) have followed this approach and have shown how several different
              | dimensions of one’s personal future may affect one’s behaviour. Nuttin even
              | went so far as to create a theory of human motivation based on the notion of
              | personal future. He considers that the future is a pivotal life space, as opposed to
              | the present and the past, which are of lesser importance. Several dimensions
              | structure our future. Among these dimensions, the best-known are the future
              | time perspective (FTP), the consideration of future consequence, anxiety, hope
              | and future-orientation. The future time perspective represents all the goals of an
              | individual, that is, ‘all future mental representations associated with an affect’
              | (Bouffard, 1993, author’s translation). There are two components in the FTP: a
              | cognitive component and an affective component. The cognitive component of
              | the FTP is made up of ‘goal objects’ (Nuttin, 1980), which are more or less
              | distant from the present. According to Lens (1993), someone whose goals are
              | mainly located in the immediate future has a limited FTP, whereas someone
              | URIEN: SELFLESS TIME
meta          | 371
text          | whose goals extend to a distant future has an extended FTP. Moreover,
              | Strathman et al. (1994) developed a new dimension, the consideration of future
              | consequences (CFC), which deals with ‘the extent to which individuals think
              | about the relatively immediate versus distant consequences of their potential
              | actions’. As for the affective dimension of the FTP, it corresponds to one’s
              | affective attitude towards the future, which in turn consists of both a positive and
              | a negative side. The manifestations of the positive side are optimism and hope.
              | Thus, according to Zaleski (1993), the future, when considered as an environ-
              | ment conducive to making plans and reaching one’s goals, usually takes on a
              | positive motivational dimension in that it prompts one to constructive action and
              | to maintaining it. Snyder (1991) and Snyder et al. (1996) is unquestionably one
              | of the specialists in the field of hope. The negative affective attitude has been
              | considered from the angle of anxiety with regard to the future. Zaleski (1997)
              | defines it as a state of anxiety, uncertainty, fear, or concern caused by unfavour-
              | able changes that could occur in one’s distant personal future. Predominant
              | temporal orientation is yet another important factor. According to the definition
              | given by Nuttin (1980), this temporal orientation is the preferential or predomi-
              | nant orientation of an individual towards one of the three temporal directions:
              | past, present or future. Thus, if an individual’s centre of interests, concerns or
              | conversations pertain to the future, he is then said to be future-oriented.
              | If temporal orientation, in its broader sense, is one of the most fundamental
              | aspects of humanity, most of the publications devoted to it consider the future as
              | a Lewinian life space and do not take into account events that may occur after
              | this life space. Yet for Boyd and Zimbardo (1997) the future can be partitioned
              | into pre- and post-death time frames. While the traditional psychological and
              | ‘mundane’ future begins in the present and extends to physical death, this
              | new notion of a transcendental future starts with physical death and goes on to
              | infinity. The transcendental future perspective may contain goals such as being
              | reunited with deceased loved ones, eternal life, reincarnation, etc. According
              | to the authors, the transcendental future perspective is a personality trait with
              | individual differences; it also influences our present behaviour.
              | The main contribution of Boyd and Zimbardo (1997) has been to free the
              | future perspective from the physical limit imposed by death. Nevertheless, it is
              | important to underline that they insist on cognitive components of the transcen-
              | dental future perspective that are generally positive (being reunited with
              | deceased relatives, etc.). Just like the classical future perspective has affective
              | dimensions, be they negative (anxiety towards the future) or positive (hope,
              | optimism), the transcendental future perspective must have an affective compo-
              | nent to deal with the anticipation of the absence of one’s self. The present
              | article insists on the negative affective component, that is, death anxiety. Death
              | anxiety is rarely dealt with from the point of view of time, and yet it belongs to
              | the network of the personal future (pre- and post-death). Furthermore, this kind
meta          | 372
text          | TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)
              | of ‘selfless time’ has been the topic of important studies dealing with its content
              | and influence on behaviour.
              | Death anxiety: A definition
              | Since the seminal work of Feifel (1955), more than 1,000 papers have dealt with
              | death anxiety, its definition, its causes and its behavioural consequences. Few
              | authors, among them Dickstein (1975), Neimeyer (1994), have ventured to
              | define the concept. On the basis of these various definitions, I will first give my
              | own definition of death anxiety and then outline its main characteristics. I define
              | death anxiety as a set of negative emotional reactions of variable intensity
              | induced by selfless anticipation (Urien, 2003). While many authors qualify
              | death anxiety as an emotional reaction, Neimeyer (1994) is more precise and,
              | under the generic name of death anxiety, includes ‘a set of attitudes character-
              | ized by fear, threat, anxiety, illness, discomfort, or any other similar negative
              | feeling’. Furthermore, recent attempts at defining death anxiety speak about ‘a
              | state during which the self does not exist’ (Tomer and Eliason, 1996). In the con-
              | text of time, we will speak about selfless anticipation. Nevertheless, whereas
              | early work presented death anxiety as a one-dimensional construct only
              | (Templer, 1970), at the present time some authors wish to differentiate several
              | sub-dimensions of anxiety, such as the anxiety regarding one’s physical state
              | after death, one’s destruction, or the loss of one’s social identity. In actual fact,
              | according to Neimeyer (1994), it seems that there exists a general anxiety
              | towards the disappearance of one’s self. This general anxiety can then be sub-
              | divided according to the kind of thought – pertaining to death – that causes
              | anxiety (physical destruction, loss of one’s soul, loss of one’s identity, etc.)
              | (Urien, 2003).
              | Selfless Time, Death Anxiety and Behavioural Adaptation
              | Regarding behavioural reactions, various theories have shown that individuals
              | develop different means of self-preservation. These means can be direct and/or
              | indirect, and take the form of physiological necessities and symbols respect-
              | ively. Theorists of death anxiety have only focused on symbolic forms in their
              | investigations. In this respect, two major consequences have appeared: the first
              | was developed in a pioneering theory, the Terror Management Theory (TMT)
              | (Solomon et al., 1991), which deals with faith in a cultural world-view and self-
              | esteem, whereas the second deals with generativity and ‘outliving the self’
              | (Kotre, 1984).

text          | Selfless anticipation and terror management
              | First identified by Jeff Greenberg, Tom Pyszczynski and Sheldon Solomon
              | (Greenberg et al., 1990), TMT has been the subject of more than 200 empirical
              | studies. It states that death anxiety is the emotional manifestation of the funda-
              | mental instinct of self-preservation. Preservation of the self may be fulfilled
              | through direct means (e.g. remaining healthy, avoiding bad food), but also, more
              | importantly, through symbolic means related to the individual’s culture. To
              | be more precise, there are two symbolic and closely linked self-preservation
              | mechanisms: (1) unfailing support of world-views and the values of one’s
              | culture, and (2) increase in self-esteem – a goal that may be reached by adopting
              | culturally valued behaviours. Concerning adaptation based on faith in a cultural
              | world-view, the theory states that we construct a culture and take part in it so as
              | to minimize the concern associated with death or the loss of self. While culture
              | can offer immortality through religion, it also contributes to creating a cultural
              | framework or ‘world-view’ composed of values clearly identifiable by indi-
              | viduals. As for adaptation grounded on self-esteem, the more an individual
              | subscribes to and respects the values of his/her culture, the more his/her self-
              | esteem increases and the less anxious he/she feels about his/her own death.
              | Experimental studies have shown that behavioural adaptation, for example,
              | could lead to: (1) risky behaviour (Orit Taubman Ben-Ari, 2000), (2) conspicu-
              | ous consumption and greed, (3) pro-social behaviours, (4) a decrease in high-
              | calorie fatty food intake that has a negative impact on both the body and
              | self-image (Ferraro et al., 2005).
              | When selfless anticipation ‘outlives the self’: Generativity
              | While, for Thomas (1995), ‘generativity answers the human quest for immortal-
              | ity’, Kotre (1984) considers it to be a kind of ‘outliving of the self’. After
              | presenting the concept of generativity, this part will highlight one of its possible
              | manifestations, that is, ‘time capsules’.
              | The concept of generativity was first introduced by Erik Erikson (1963) over
              | 40 years ago. ‘Generativity versus stagnation’ is the seventh of the eight stages
              | in Erikson’s human life cycle theory. It is first associated with the middle adult
              | years. Bearing and raising children are the first experiences of generativity.
              | However, a broader definition of this concept includes different life settings,
              | such as ‘professional activities, volunteer endeavours, participation in religious
              | and political organizations, neighbourhood and community activism, friendship
              | and even leisure time pursuits’ (McAdams and de St. Aubin, 1998). McAdams
              | and de St. Aubin (1998) suggested a typology of generativity that includes
              | different generative behaviours (McAdams and de St. Aubin, 1992): creating,
              | maintaining and offering one’s self. By ‘creating’, the authors mean a generative
meta          | 374
text          | TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)
              | behaviour towards things and people, figuratively and literally giving birth to
              | both (McAdams et al., 1998). It involves ‘the creation of a product or legacy in
              | one’s own image . . . a powerful extension of the self (idem)’ (McAdams et al.,
              | 1998: 23) as well. ‘Maintaining’ is another kind of generative behaviour. It
              | consists of the conservation or the preservation behaviours that are valued.
              | McAdams et al. (1998) mention behaviours such as preserving good traditions.
              | ‘Offering’ corresponds to the offering or the gifts of things that have previously
              | been created and maintained, or the handing down of something or someone
              | to the next generation. This can be understood as a way of extending one’s
              | existence beyond physical death to reach symbolic immortality. According to
              | McAdams et al. (1998), ‘generativity is tied up with a society’s overall concep-
              | tion of time’. If we are talking about creating new things or human beings that
              | will outlive the self, generativity then deals with the long-term future.
              | Maintaining, preserving and passing on goods and traditions point to the past.
              | Therefore, by creating a link between different generations, generativity bridges
              | the past and the future. Generativity could induce such behaviours as ecologi-
              | cally friendly behaviour (Urien and Kilbourne, 2007).
              | An illustration and manifestation of the concept of generativity is the
              | phenomenon of ‘time capsules’. A time capsule contains goods and/or informa-
              | tion that are representative of life at a given point in time, and which could
              | be used as a means of communication with people in the future. The common
              | characteristic of all existing time capsules is probably the need to transcend the
              | end of one’s personal future by means of a gift that reflects a given period of
              | time, the need to preserve it and to pass it on to future generations.
              | I have previously discussed how temporal orientation, and more specifically
              | the personal future, has been considered and dimensioned almost exclusively as
              | a ‘life space’. Yet philosophically and psychologically, certain authors show
              | that the representation of the future cannot be envisaged without integrating the
              | anticipation of self-absence: death. I have insisted here on the affective dimen-
              | sion linked to this anticipation: death anxiety. Its main behavioural influences
              | have also been introduced. In part two, I aim to examine in depth the relations
              | between death anxiety and certain traditional dimensions of the future. If death
              | anxiety belongs to the structure of the personal future, what are the links and the
              | intensity of these links with the traditional dimensions of temporal orientation
              | and those of the personal future in particular? Is future anxiety linked to death
              | anxiety? Do individuals orientated towards the future have the same intensity of
              | death anxiety as individuals orientated towards the past or the present? These are
              | the questions that the following empirical study will attempt to address.

text          | Few studies deal with the links between different temporal dimensions and death
              | anxiety. Bascue et al. (1977) have shown, for example, that based on a sample
              | of 88 77-year-old Americans, death anxiety is associated with an orientation
              | towards the future (Bascue et al., 1977). Dickstein (1975), based on a sample of
              | 185 American students and using Thematic Aperception Test (TAT) tests to
              | measure temporal orientation, has shown a link between orientation towards the
              | past and death anxiety. However, no links were found with an orientation
              | towards the future. What then are the links with other temporal dimensions? On
              | other groups? On different age categories? On different cultures? By using other
              | methodological tools?
              | This study will contribute to answering these questions by studying more
              | specifically the links that exist between death anxiety, future anxiety and pre-
              | dominant orientation towards the future. In contrast with these dimensions
              | linked to the future, the study of links with an orientation towards the past and
              | the present will also be integrated. Each construct has been operationalized
              | by an indicator of measure and I have used so-called ‘second-generation’ pro-
              | cessing methods. After validating the different measurement models corre-
              | sponding to the indicators retained, we will then be able to envisage the links
              | existing between the different latent factors.
              | Operationalization of the Constructs and Presenting the Scales
              | The indicators retained to measure death anxiety, predominant temporal orien-
              | tation towards the future, the past and the present, and, finally, future anxiety,
              | are introduced successively.
              | A measure of death anxiety
              | The construction of scales to measure this construct has been particularly
              | developed in recent years due to an interest in a better understanding of the
              | individual differences regarding death anxiety, their origins and their conse-
              | quences. Robert Neimeyer, of the University of Memphis, is currently the
              | specialist in this area. Although numerous indicators can be noted at the present
              | time (for a summary, see Neimeyer 1994, 1997–8), the author, however, high-
              | lights two important problems: discordant definitions of the concept and a lack
              | of a theoretical base, to the point that St-Amour and Kiely (2000) ask if the
              | function of the death anxiety scale is to define the concept. From the middle of
              | the 1950s until the end of the 1970s, indirect tests with a projective tendency
              | were used. Among these tests I note, for example, the 10 ‘TAT’ drawings that
meta          | 376
text          | TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)
              | refer to death (Epley and Rick, 1963, cited in Dickstein, 1975). However, the
              | creation and the use of these tools rapidly declined, notably due to the cumber-
              | someness of an important manipulation, a lack of validity and reliability, and the
              | arrival of much more practical attitude scales that made it possible to directly
              | apprehend death anxiety. In fact, 95 percent of the studies published in psy-
              | chology on this topic use these types of test (Neimeyer, 1997–8). Among the
              | better known, we cite Templer’s (1970) ‘Death Anxiety Scale (D.A.S)’, Colett
              | and Lester’s (1969) the ‘Fear of Death Scale (F.D.S)’, Neimeyer’s (1994)
              | ‘Threat Index (T.I)’ and Dickstein’s (1975) ‘Death Concern Scale (D.C.S)’.
              | Moreover, the last scale is composed of 30 items and 2 dimensions: one dimen-
              | sion representing the conscious meditation of death, and a second dimension
              | representing a negative evaluation of it. However, only the second factor is con-
              | sidered as specifically characterizing death anxiety. The other dimension does
              | not correspond to negative emotional reaction towards death but to the con-
              | sciousness of it. In addition, a more recent analysis (Klug and Boss, 1976) shows
              | that the factor relative to death anxiety is only composed of five items. I can also
              | add here that this factor is apprehended in a general, undifferentiated manner.
              | Furthermore, this scale is the only one that has been validated to date in a French
              | context (Urien, 2001).
              | Measures of predominant temporal orientation and future anxiety
              | I have chosen Usunier and Valette-Florence’s ‘Times Styles Scale’ (1994) in
              | order to measure temporal orientation. It should be noted here that in its com-
              | plete version, this scale measures 4 dimensions and 8 sub-dimensions in 29
              | items. I have kept the dimensions that seem pertinent for this study, that is, the
              | predominant temporal orientation towards the past and the predominant orienta-
              | tion towards the future. This scale offers very good psychometric qualities and
              | has often been used (partially or completely) on various and numerous popula-
              | tions and in different cultural contexts (Valette-Florence et al., 2001), resulting
              | in many relatively recent publications (for a summary, see Usunier and Valette-
              | Florence in this issue).
              | This scale does not take into account present-orientation. I have used one of
              | the dimensions of the temporal orientations scale developed by Ko and Gentry
              | (1991), and by Gentry (1993) for this specific dimension. The reliability of the
              | measure of this dimension is adequate (α = 0.74). The authors have attempted to
              | test the intercultural validity of these scales on two samples (American and
              | Thai students) and to explore the sub-dimensions. However, only the present-
              | orientation appeared to resist an invariance of factors.
              | Concerning future anxiety, we have used Zaleski’s scale (1996). This one-
              | dimensional scale, tested and validated on several American and Polish samples,
              | has good psychometric qualities. It is composed of 29 items in all, 4 of which are
              | URIEN: SELFLESS TIME
meta          | 377
text          | ‘buffers’. Moreover, in order to check the global convergent validity of the scale
              | in relation to other ones that are conceptually close, the author correlated the
              | Polish version of this scale with other anxiety scales. The coefficients obtained
              | show that this type of anxiety is close to traditional conceptions of anxiety, be it
              | Cattell’s (1966) ‘Overt-Covert Anxiety’ (r = 0.48, N = 88), Taylor’s (1953)
              | ‘Manifest Anxiety’ (r = 0.64, N= 83) or Spielberger ’s (1971) ‘Trait Anxiety’
              | (r = 0.61, N = 135). In fact, if all of these results show that all of these scales
              | belong to the same network of the conceptual sphere of anxiety, the scale of
              | future anxiety, however, conserves its own specificity and its own discriminat-
              | ing utility. Finally, this scale shows encouraging psychometric qualities as well
              | as a cross-cultural method central to the process of creating a scale.
              | Validation of the scales used
              | I have worked from two samples of individuals of French origin: one sample of
              | 349 young adults (average age: 21) and a sample of 302 older adults (average
              | age: 47). Six hundred and fifty-one questionnaires were then used for the data
              | analysis. According to the works of Gesser et al. (1987), the individuals in their
              | 40s would have a higher death anxiety than the individuals belonging to other
              | age groups. In fact, these two samples have multiple interests: they allow us to
              | have differences in mean age that are important enough to detect a potential
              | variation in the intensity of the level of death anxiety whatever the meaning of
              | this variation. It also makes it possible to analyse the stability of relations
              | between death anxiety and the different traditional temporal dimensions.
              | Considering the size of our samples and the nature of our variables, I have
              | retained more specifically the method of estimation according to the maximum
              | likelihood. Concerning the translation of the scales into French, I have used the
              | technique of blind parallel translation: each of the three translators involved
              | did his own translation from the source language to the target language inde-
              | pendently, then the different versions were compared and a final version was
              | made.
              | Test of the short form scale of death anxiety
              | As recommended by Klug and Boss (1976), the texts were administered to the
              | two samples in its original version. An exploratory factorial analysis then made
              | it possible to keep items whose ‘loadings’ were superior to 0.50 on one factor
              | and weak on the other factor. My analysis was based uniquely on the dimension
              | concerning death anxiety. This analysis permitted me to find again the five items
              | that specifically measure death anxiety. A confirmatory analysis to one latent
              | factor and five variables of measure was then realized. Validation of the
              | measures was done based on the confirmatory analyses. The adequacy of the
meta          | 378
text          | TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)
              | final specified model of measure with the data is satisfactory on the two samples
              | (comparative fit index [CFI*] of 0.99/0.98). The reliability tests give satis-
              | factory results. Indeed, the calculation of Joreskog’s ρ gives a result of 0.88 for
              | the young adults and 0.82 for the older adults. In order to be certain of the con-
              | vergent validity, I retained only three indictors: a significant link between the
              | variables of measure and their latent factor, satisfactory criteria of adjustment
              | and, finally, factorial weights > 0.5. Since all of the criteria have been observed,
              | we can then conclude that the reliability is good and that the validity of the scale
              | is satisfactory for the two samples.
              | Test of the future anxiety scale
              | The exploratory factorial analysis done on the 25 statements showed the
              | existence of a main factor on the two samples. I therefore retained the first
              | component and specified a model of measure to one factor. In the end, I obtained
              | a one-dimensional structure and 13 variables from the 2 samples. These
              | variables have a significant liaison with their latent factor. The adequacy of the
              | specified models of measure with the data is very satisfactory (CFI* of
              | 0.98/0.96). The coefficients of reliability are good (Joreskog’s ρ is 0.90 for the
              | young adults and 0.92 for the older adults). The Z tests are all significant and
              | the supplementary guarantee of convergent validity are given by satisfactory
              | criteria of adjustment and factorial weights all superior to 0.5.
              | Tests of future-orientation, past-orientation and present-orientation scales
              | After a confirmatory analysis of the items corresponding to predominant
              | temporal orientations, we obtain the two dimensions corresponding to future-
              | orientation and past-orientation on the two samples. The coefficients of reli-
              | ability are good (ρ of 0.78 and 0.77 for orientation towards the past, and 0.78
              | and 0.67 for orientation towards the future). With a CFI of 0.95 and 0.97, the
              | two specified models have a good quality of adjustment. All of the Z tests are
              | significant, and all of the statements have a factorial weight > 0.5, which attest
              | to the convergent validity.
              | Regarding orientation towards the present, a confirmatory analysis with a
              | latent factor and 6 variables of measure has been done. An in-depth reading of
              | the different variables shows that they express an active search for pleasure very
              | close to hedonism. The quality of the fit index are excellent for both the samples
              | of young adults and older adults. The indices of reliability are good (Joreskog’s
              | ρ: 0.86/0.85) and the convergent validity is satisfactory. The quality of the
              | indicators of adjustment and the fact that all of the statements except one have a
              | factorial weight > 0.5 are additional guarantees of convergent validity.

              | Analysis of the links between the traditional temporal dimensions and
              | death anxiety
              | After having examined the psychometric quality of each scale, we can now
              | envisage a correlational analysis between the different latent factors. Having
              | two samples makes it possible to observe the stability of the coefficients
              | obtained. Concerning the quality of the model and considering the lack of
              | normality of the data distribution, the robust fit index has been retained. The
              | value of the CFI (0.91), of the incremental fit index (IFI) (0.91) and the root
              | mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) (0.053) permits us to maintain
              | that our models possess a satisfactory quality of adjustment.
              | The analysis of the results shows that death anxiety is positively and signifi-
              | cantly correlated to future anxiety, orientation towards the past and orientation
              | towards the future. On the other hand, the correlation coefficient is negative but
              | significant with orientation towards the present. One will also note that the
              | intensity of the correlation coefficients is different, depending on the temporal
              | dimensions, and that these coefficients vary slightly between the two samples.
              | Moderating effect of age
              | We will successively study the moderating effect of age on the variation in the
              | intensity of death anxiety between the two samples, and the variation in the
              | intensity of correlation links between death anxiety and the other temporal
              | dimensions studied in this research. This last analysis will make it possible to
              | know if the slight variations observed are significant or not.

              | Study of the influence of age on the intensity of death anxiety
              | We have tested the existence of significant differences between the mean death
              | anxiety of young adults and older adults. This mean was calculated based on the
              | summations of the scores obtained on the five items constituting death anxiety.
              | The results of the univariate descriptive statistics are given in Table 2.
              | The calculation of the Z test gives us a result of 3.17. Since the result is
              | superior to 1.96, the bilateral mean comparison test shows that the differences in
              | death anxiety are significant, p = 5 per cent. In our samples, death anxiety felt at
              | 47 years of age is then slightly more important than it is felt at 21 years of age.
              | The influence of age on the intensity of the correlation links between death
              | anxiety and the other temporal dimensions
              | According to Byrne’s (1994) recommendations on the subject, studying the
              | moderating effect of a variable on the links between latent factors amounts to
              | carrying out a multi-group analysis by testing the invariance of the parameters
              | of measure and the parameters of correlation on several samples. This is pre-
              | cisely why I worked with two samples: one made up of young adults, the other
              | of older adults. In order to do so, I used Lagrange’s test, which evaluates the
              | effects of liberating the parameters fixed in the initial specified model on
              | the decline of the ‘Chi square’, and makes it possible to improve the quality of
              | the model. I then followed the classical method recommended by Byrne and I
              | then simultaneously tested the invariance of the measurement models and the
              | invariance of the correlation links. I set constraints of equality between the
              | parameters of measure (coefficients of regression of the different variables of
              | measure on their latent factor) for the two samples, and constraints of equality
              | between the parameters corresponding to the correlation coefficients between
              | the latent factors obtained on the sample of the young adults and those obtained
              | on the sample of older adults. The analysis of the results show that the quality of
              | the multi-group model seemed satisfactory on the whole (Chi square = 1458, d.f.
              | = 763, NFI = 0.901, CFI = 0.902, RMSEA = 0.053). The observation of
              | URIEN: SELFLESS TIME
meta          | 381
text          | Lagrange’s multivariate tests on the ‘constrained’ parameters of the measure of
              | death anxiety shows none of them are significant. This means that there is
              | invariance in the instrument of measure on the two samples. However, this
              | observation of Lagrange’s test on the ‘constrained’ measures of future anxiety
              | shows that two reductions of the Chi square (out of 13 possibilities) appear
              | significant if the constraints of equality are eliminated. There is then only
              | ‘partial invariance’ (Byrne, 1994) of the instrument of measure of future
              | anxiety. Finally, Lagrange’s test is negative on the different constrained
              | parameters related to the correlation links between death anxiety and the other
              | temporal dimensions (future anxiety, orientation towards the future, the present
              | and the past). This signifies that there is invariance in the intensity of the links.
              | The slight differences observed between the two samples in Table 1 are then not
              | significant.
              | Interpretation of the Results
              | The analysis of the results is interesting for several reasons. First, I have to admit
              | that fundamental dimensions such as the predominant temporal orientation and
              | future anxiety are empirically linked to death anxiety, and this on two samples
              | of a suitable size. Moreover, these links are stable no matter what the age group.
              | In a more detailed approach, one will observe at first the important links
              | between apprehension of the pre and post-mortem future (future anxiety and
              | death anxiety). If some results have shown positive links between short-term
              | classical anxiety and death anxiety, my study shows that these links also exist
              | when anxiety towards a more distinct future is taken into account. If, as stated by
              | Zaleski (1996), this future anxiety excludes death anxiety in that it refers to a
              | future that ‘we will live and act in’, death can be, however, considered as a
              | singular event of that future; and, life after death as a particular period of the
              | latter. The correlation between future anxiety and death anxiety can be inter-
              | preted in the following manner: the more one is anxious faced with one’s life
              | space, the more one is anxious faced with one’s death space.
              | The existence of a liaison, albeit moderate, with orientation towards the future
              | is initially more surprising. In fact, it can be considered that the fact of being
              | orientated in a predominant way by inclination towards one’s future goes hand
              | in hand with a more acute consciousness of the limits of this future and hence a
              | more pronounced anxiety regarding it.
              | The links with orientation towards the past are more pronounced but still
              | positive. These results confirm those of Dickstein (1975: 154): orientation
              | towards the past could be ‘a direct consequence of the consciousness of death
              | and represents an attempt to be content with the experience and to resist the
              | rapid passing of time’. Finally, a very reduced negative link with orientation
meta          | 382
text          | TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)
              | towards the present, stable on the two samples, is observed. The more one would
              | be anxious faced with death, the less one would be orientated towards the
              | present that consists in the active search for pleasure. However, the low intensi-
              | ty of the links gives a limited significance to these results.
              | Regarding the modifying effect of age, the result obtained shows that an older
              | age provokes a slight significant increase in death anxiety. These results are in
              | accordance with those of Gesser et al. (1987), who have observed the existence
              | of a curvilinear relation between the two variables, namely, that death anxiety is
              | highest during mid-life.
              | Conclusion
              | The following observation was the starting point of this article: apart from the
              | work done by Boyd and Zimbardo (1997), work pertaining to the psychology of
              | time considers the personal future principally as a life space. Yet this personal
              | future is flexible enough to enable individuals to project themselves well beyond
              | this life space into a post-mortem future. Therefore, I suggested taking the
              | concept of death anxiety into account in the structure of the future. If philo-
              | sophical reflection precedes scientific reflection, it seems important that
              | researchers studying the influence of time representations on human behaviour,
              | for example consumer behaviour, should not limit themselves to apprehending
              | the future as a life space. It is also important that they explore the personal future
              | that projects us beyond our physical death and induces behavioural reactions,
              | such as the ones presented earlier.
              | The consequences, in terms of future research, present different aspects:
              | • Beyond the connections with the traditional temporal dimensions of the
              | personal future, what are the links with the other future dimensions such as
              | ‘Consideration of Future Consequences’, ‘Future Time Perspective’, ‘Hope’?
              | • I have studied here the role of age as a moderating variable of the links
              | between death anxiety and certain traditional temporal dimensions. In spite of
              | a slight increase in death anxiety during ageing, I have empirically shown that
              | the intensity of the links with the other temporal dimensions is invariant.
              | Likewise, studying the role of another moderating variable, such as religiosity,
              | would be interesting.
              | • In the present article, I have mainly insisted on the negative affect pertaining
              | to post-mortem ideas (e.g. loss of social identity). Nevertheless, some authors
              | underline an aspect that has been rather neglected by academia, namely the
              | manifestations of death acceptation (Wong, 2000). In fact, one of the possible
              | means of defending oneself against the anxiety associated with ‘not being
              | anymore’ is to do away with the desire to ‘be’ by cutting oneself off from the
              | URIEN: SELFLESS TIME
meta          | 383
text          | rest of the world. In this case, the question is how are death acceptation and
              | traditional future dimensions interconnected?
              | Note
              | 1. Two meanings of temporal orientation are found in the literature: the strict sense of
              | temporal orientation which corresponds to ‘the predominant orientation’ towards
              | one or the other traditional temporal zones (past, present, future) and the broader
              | sense of the term, which encompasses all of the temporal dimensions concerning the
              | representation of time. The latter is used in this introduction.
