              | ABSTRACT
              | Bureaucracy is the management apparatus of a state administration. Even in private sector,
              | bureaucratic organization is very much essential for its smooth functioning and betterment. A
              | legalized domination of bureaucracy only can ensure highest efficiency of an organization in a
              | country. But the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh not developed legally from Pre-colonial period to
              | post-colonial phase as well as an independent Bangladesh eventually. The state bureaucracy of
              | Bangladesh is patrimonial in nature based on personal interests. The politicians and bureaucrats are
              | interdependent in various manners for the fulfillment of their purpose illegally in Democratic
              | Bangladesh. Simultaneously, the impact of militarism still exists in state bureaucracy of Bangladesh
              | as it faced military rule in several times.

              | 1. INTRODUCTION
              | The extension of society is state. Sometimes Plato treats state as society. According to
              | Plato, state grows out of the nature of individual. Plato said, ‘‘the state is a natural institution,
              | natural because it reflects the structure of human nature. The origin of the state is a reflection
              | of man’s economic needs, for, says Plato, `a state comes into existence because no individual
              | is self-sufficing; we all have many needs.” (Stumpf: 1975). On the basis of knowledge and
              | nature of a society, Plato designed the ideal type of state considering three distinctive classes;
              | King Philosopher, Warrior and Producer. Unlike Plato, Aristotle did not create a blueprint
              | for an ideal state. But in his Politics, Aristotle says that, “it is evident that the State is a
              | creature of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal.” (Stumpf: 1975). Aristotle
              | viewed the state as the agency for enabling men to achieve their ultimate goals as human
              | being. Aristotle also sketched the different types of state nature; like Monarchy (one ruler),
              | Aristocracy (few rulers) and Polity (many). He observed three idiosyncratic classes in state;
              | Extreme Rich, Middle class and Extreme poor. His preference was middle class for governing
              | state to the holistic welfare.
              | As an Enlightenment philosopher, Hobbs, Locke and Rousseau tried to observe state as
              | a new dimension. According to Hobbs state was uneven for the people in primary stage. He
              | argued that social contract to be needed for declining the inequality. According to Locke, the

              | uneven nature of state was the golden age of human society which becomes conflicting later.
              | For the resolution of such conflict, absence of common authority is essential, Locke argued.
              | For Rousseau, man is free by birth, but step by step they become chained by social
              | surrounding. In that situation, Rousseau expects the state interference to the freedom of
              | people. From the Marxist point of view, the state is a special organ that appears at a certain
              | moment in the historical evolution of mankind. It is born from the division of society into
              | classes and act as an instrument in the hands of the possessing class for the purpose of
              | maintaining the domination of this class over society. (Mandel: 2003).
              | This domination causes class conflict in a society. According to Karl Marx, state is the
              | means of economic conflict but noting. Levine stated that the rise of state involved the
              | separation of the public and private spheres and the development of specialized political
              | institutions. (Levine: 1924). Max Weber argued that sometimes political components control
              | over the economic elements in the state on the basis of authority. He characterized three ideal
              | types of legitimate authority by state nature; Rational Legitimacy, Traditional Legitimacy and
              | Charismatic Legitimacy. (Abraham & Morgan: 1994). According to Weber, modern state
              | based on legal authority which led to formation of governing body called bureaucracy.
              | Without bureaucracy state never run purposively, Weber argued. Our objective of the study is
              | to elucidate state nature according to bureaucratic characteristics on the basis of theoretical
              | understanding in post colonial period of Bangladesh. Weber’s explanation of bureaucracy and
              | its later discussion underpins the study for gaining our objectives.
              | 2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
              | The Study of Weber’s Bureaucracy
              | Historical context of Bureaucracy: Bureaucratic Theory was developed by a German
              | Sociologist and political economist Max Weber. According to him, bureaucracy is the most
              | efficient form of organization which has a well-defined line of authority. It has clear rules and
              | regulations which are strictly followed. Weber believed that a bureaucratic type of
              | organization began in societies whose political organization tended toward officialdom. As
              | described by Ken Morrision, Early examples of societies with large political administrations
              | include the Germanic and Mongolian empires, and feudal estates of the twelfth and thirteenth
              | century. Among these societies, Weber cited the cases of emperors and feudal lords who,
              | when making known their decrees and pronouncements, would appoint commissioners whose
              | power were exercised within the lord’s jurisdiction. Weber identified six basic types of
              | Bureaucratic structure: (Morrision: 1998) –
              | 1. States which tend to control policy and policing functions;
              | 2. Ecclesiastical communities which are required to administer to large populations of
              | believers;
              | 3. Economies whose main function is to distribute goods and coordinate functions;
              | 4. The modern agency;
              | 5. The military and
              | 6. The judiciary
              | Weber looked at the administration of early Egypt and Rome, at the administration of
              | Catholic Church, at Asiatic societies and at feudal economies of central Europe. While these
              | societies develop administrative staff and trained decision maker, they are in weber’s view,
              | International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 7
meta          | 45
text          | formally pre-bureaucratic in their administration which restricts the development of
              | bureaucracy to modern society. According to Hellen Constas, Weber defined such kinds of
              | bureaucracy is patrimonial bureaucracy depends on charismatic or traditional authority
              | (Constas: 1958).
              | Mainly Max Weber talked about the bureaucracy based on legal or rational legitimacy
              | in modern industrial society. According to Weber, ‘Bureaucracy refers to an instrument that
              | has become indispensible for the rational attainment of the goals of any organization in
              | industrial society’. (Rao: 2000). According to Weber, the term bureaucracy in terms of an
              | organization and management functions refers to the following six principles (Miller: 2008):
              | Management by rules: A bureaucracy follows a consistent set of rules that control the
              | functions of the organization. Management controls the lower levels of the organization's
              | hierarchy by applying established rules in a consistent and predictable manner.
              | Division of labor: Authority and responsibility are clearly defined and officially sanctioned.
              | Job descriptions are specified with responsibilities and line of authority. All employees have
              | thus clearly defined rules in a system of authority and subordination.
              | Formal hierarchical structure: An organization is organized into a hierarchy of authority
              | and follows a clear chain of command. The hierarchical structure effectively delineates the
              | lines of authority and the subordination of the lower levels to the upper levels of the
              | hierarchical structure.
              | Personnel hired on grounds of technical competence: Appointment to a position within the
              | organization is made on the grounds of technical competence. Work is assigned based on the
              | experience and competence of the individual.
              | Managers are salaried officials: A manager is a salaried official and does own the
              | administered unit. All elements of a bureaucracy are defined with clearly defined roles and
              | responsibilities and are managed by trained and experienced specialists.
              | Written documents: All decisions, rules and actions taken by the organization are formulated
              | and recorded in writing. Written documents ensure that there is continuity of the
              | organization’s policies and procedures.
              | Max Weber was the first to give an elaborate account of the development of
              | bureaucracy as well as its causes and consequences. According to Weber, modern
              | officialdom functions in the specific manner. He attributed the following characteristics to
              | bureaucracy in his book ‘Economy and Society’ (Weber: 1968) –
              | I. There is the principle of fixed and official jurisdictional areas, which are generally ordered
              | by rules, that is, by laws or administrative regulations.
              | 1. The regular activities required for the purposes of the bureaucratically governed
              | structure are distributed in a fixed way as official duties.
              | 2. The authority to give the commands required for the discharge of these duties is
              | distributed in a stable way and is strictly delimited by rules concerning the coercive
              | means, physical, sacerdotal, or otherwise, which may be placed at the disposal of
              | officials.
              | 3. Methodical provision is made for the regular and continuous fulfillment of these
              | duties and for the execution of the corresponding rights; only persons who have the
              | generally regulated qualifications to serve are employed.

              | In public and lawful government these three elements constitute 'bureaucratic authority.' In
              | private economic domination, they constitute bureaucratic 'management.' Bureaucracy, thus
              | understood, is fully developed in political and ecclesiastical communities only in the modern
              | state, and, in the private economy, only in the most advanced institutions of capitalism.
              | Permanent and public office authority, with fixed jurisdiction, is not the historical rule but
              | rather the exception. This is so even in large political structures such as those of the ancient
              | Orient, the Germanic and Mongolian empires of conquest, or of many feudal structures of
              | state. In all these cases, the ruler executes the most important measures through personal
              | trustees, table-companions, or court-servants. Their commissions and authority are not
              | precisely delimited and are temporarily called into being for each case.
              | II. The principles of office hierarchy and of levels of graded authority mean a firmly ordered
              | system of super- and subordination in which there is a supervision of the lower offices by the
              | higher ones. Such a system offers the governed the possibility of appealing the decision of a
              | lower office to its higher authority, in a definitely regulated manner. With the full
              | development of the bureaucratic type, the office hierarchy is monocratically organized. The
              | principle of hierarchical office authority is found in all bureaucratic structures: in state and
              | ecclesiastical structures as well as in large party organizations and 'private' or private
              | enterprises. It does not matter for the character of bureaucracy whether its authority is called
              | 'public.'
              | When the principle of jurisdictional 'competency' is fully carried through, hierarchical
              | subordination--at least in public office--does not mean that the 'higher' authority is simply
              | authorized to take over the business of the 'lower.' Indeed, the opposite is the rule. Once
              | established and having fulfilled its task, an office tends to continue in existence and be held
              | by another incumbent.
              | III. The management of the modern office is based upon written documents ('the files'),
              | which are preserved in their original or draught form. There is, therefore, a staff of subaltern
              | officials and scribes of all sorts. The body of officials actively engaged in a 'public' office,
              | along with the respective apparatus of material implements and the files make up a 'bureau.'
              | In private enterprise, 'the bureau' is often called 'the office.'
              | In principle, the modern organization of the civil service separates the bureau from the
              | private domicile of the official, and, in general, bureaucracy segregates official activity as
              | something distinct from the sphere of private life. Public monies and equipment are divorced
              | from the private property of the official. This condition is everywhere the product of a long
              | development. Nowadays, it is found in public as well as in private enterprises; in the latter,
              | the principle extends even to the leading entrepreneur. In principle, the executive office is
              | separated from the household, business from private correspondence, and business assets
              | from private fortunes. The more consistently the modern type of business management has
              | been carried through the more are these separations the case. The beginnings of this process
              | are to be found as early as the middle Ages.
              | IV. Office management, at least all specialized office management-- and such management is
              | distinctly modern--usually presupposes thorough and expert training. This increasingly holds
              | for the modern executive and employee of private enterprises, in the same manner as it holds
              | for the state official.
              | V. When the office is fully developed, official activity demands the full working capacity of
              | the official, irrespective of the fact that his obligatory time in the bureau may be firmly
              | delimited. In the normal case, this is only the product of a long development, in the public as
              | International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 7
meta          | 47
text          | well as in the private office. Formerly, in all cases, the normal state of affairs was reversed:
              | official business was discharged as a secondary activity.
              | VI. The management of the office follows general rules, which are more or less stable, more
              | or less exhaustive, and which can be learned. Knowledge of these rules represents a special
              | technical learning which the officials possess. It involves jurisprudence, or administrative or
              | business management.
              | The reduction of modern office management to rules is deeply embedded in its very nature.
              | The theory of modern public administration, for instance, assumes that the authority to order
              | certain matters by decree--which has been legally granted to public authorities--does not
              | entitle the bureau to regulate the matter by commands given for each case, but only to
              | regulate the matter abstractly. This stands in extreme contrast to the regulation of all
              | relationships through individual privileges and bestowals of favor, which is absolutely
              | dominant in patrimonialism, at least in so far as such relationships are not fixed by sacred
              | tradition.
              | State Bureaucracy in Bangladesh perspective
              | Hamza Alavi (1921-2003): There are very few theoretical contribution instituted on
              | the study of post-colonial state like Bangladesh. Alavi’s one of the most important works
              | entitled `The State in post-colonial societies: Pakistan and Bangladesh’ based on
              | interpretation of autonomous state in the third world. According to Anupam Sen, `His main
              | argument is as follows: in the colonial period the bureaucratic military state apparatus was
              | overdeveloped because it had to exercise domination over the native social classes. In the
              | post-colonial period too, Alavi Argues, the state has remain autonomous, because no single
              | class has succeeded in establishing its rule over the over-developed state.’ (Sen: 2009). In his
              | theoretical explanation, Alavi tried build up relationship between bureaucracy and other
              | social classes. He also revealed that bureaucracy act as an interwoven among the interest of
              | three social classes; Metropolitan Bourgeoisie, Indigenous Bourgeoisie and Upper class
              | based on land. (Alam: 2007). The main arguments of his theory are as follows –
              | 1. State bureaucracy is overdeveloped in post-colonial societies
              | 2. Indigenous bourgeoisie are underdeveloped
              | 3. State bureaucracy is autonomous.
              | He also pointed out that the post-colonial state is surrounded and driven by powerful
              | bureaucratic military. This point is very much applicable to understand post-colonial state
              | nature of Bangladesh.
              | Anupam Sen: He introduced bureaucratic interpretation in his PhD dissertation from
              | new-Marxist point of view. Dr. Sen tried to find out the limitation of Hamza Alavi’s
              | interpretation of Bureaucracy and state nature of post-colonial Bangladesh. According to Sen,
              | `It is true that, as he (Alavi) asserts, the classes in most third world countries are
              | underdeveloped. But it is not true; as he claims that the state apparatus was over –
              | development in the colonial period. In fact, in many independent but semi-colonized
              | countries – such as most Latin American countries and Nepal, Thailand, Afghanistan and Iran
              | for example – the state apparatus, the bureaucracy, the judiciary, etc., remain
              | underdeveloped. (Sen: 2009).
              | Dr. Sen stated that the social classes in most post-colonial third world societies have
              | failed to establish their hegemony over the state not because the state apparatus was over
meta          | 48
text          | Volume 7
              | developed by the colonial rulers, as Alavi argues, but because the state was stronger than the
              | social classes long before these societies were colonized.
              | The state apparatus in most pre-colonial societies was patriarchal but superior vis-à-vis
              | the indigenous social classes. The colonial state apparatus, at least in the case of India 9 (as
              | well as Pakistan and Bangladesh), evolved from the patriarchal Moghul state which the
              | colonizing power inherited.’ (Sen: 2009). So, the main features of his theory regarding state
              | of Bangladesh are as follows –
              | 1. State bureaucracy is stronger than the social classes now and long before these
              | societies were colonized that means the state apparatus (Bureaucracy) was over-
              | developed before colonial period
              | 2. The state apparatus in most pre-colonial societies was patriarchal and the colonial
              | state apparatus evolved from the patriarchal Moghul state.
              | 3. Historically the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh still bears its pre-colonial and
              | colonial roots.
              | Emajuddin Ahmed: Another scholar, Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed discussed on
              | Bureaucratic Elites in Bangladesh on his PhD dissertation. Mainly his dissertation based on
              | the study to analyze the nature of the dominant bureaucratic elites in Bangladesh and the
              | development strategy they have been pursuing.
              | He argues in his study that the ideal relationship between the general public and their
              | leaders, as these civil servants see it, does not differ very much from the colonial pattern.
              | (Ahmed: 1980). He also said the existing administrative structure and the institutional
              | framework were built long ago by the British in colonial India with a view to achieving their
              | limited ends, and these institutions served them well. (Ahmed: 1980). By following the
              | arguments of Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed, the nature of Bureaucracy in Bangladesh would be –
              | 1. The relationships among general public, their leaders and civil servants (Bureaucrats)
              | are colonial in nature.
              | 2. The present Bureaucratic framework is similar as administration in colonial
              | Bangladesh.
              | A.T.M. Obaidullah: According to him, ‘Since Bangladesh does not have, as yet, a
              | composite and unified civil service law as in other countries, the various rules, regulations,
              | manuals, and circulars have the effect of law and government departments as obliged to
              | follow these rules in discharging their day to day administration.
              | These various statutory and non-statutory rules provide detailed guidelines on
              | recruitment, promotion, and disciplinary action and employee welfare.’(Obaidullah:1999). In
              | the question of promotion, he argues that In respect of promotion and career opportunities
              | discrimination on political consideration happens to be so conspicuous that denies the
              | fundamental rights guaranteed in the constitution.’ (Obaidullah: 1999). ‘After 21 years of
              | independence the promotion process of 654 officials to the various posts of Bangladesh
              | Secretariat in 1992 overtly manifested the authoritarian attitude and political bias of the
              | government in place of impartiality and objectivity, not tarnished the essence of merit

              | 3. UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF STATE BUREAUCRACY IN
              | BANGLADESH
              | The British established their rule in Bengal by defeating Mughol Empire in 1757. As
              | described by Willem Van Schendel, ‘On a fine June day in 1757 thousands of men were
              | fighting in a mango orchard close to the border of present-day Bangladesh. This battle
              | became famous as a turning-point in the history of South Asia. It took place in the small
              | village of Polashi, and the encounter established the British East India Company as the new
              | territorial overlord over Bengal. Within a century this trading conglomerate would capture
              | practically all of South Asia.
              | Historians have often described the Battle of Polashi as the beginning of British
              | colonial rule in South Asia, a rule that would last till 1947’. (Willem: 2009). And Bangladesh
              | became free containing constitutional law; secularism, socialism, democracy and nationalism
              | from Pakistani colony by Liberation War in 1971 after the partition of Indian sub-continent
              | into India and Pakistan in 1947. For handling British rule properly, they established an
              | administrative structure by following Mughol patriarchal bureaucracy which is remaining in
              | the characteristics of post-colonial bureaucracy of Bangladesh.
              | Before the industrialization in Europe, British were driven by patrimonial bureaucracy
              | as mentioned by Max Weber. They introduced the same bureaucratic structure (as apparatus
              | of Plato’s ideal state) in Indian-subcontinent for ensuring proper taxation only.
              | The authority of tax collection of Zamindar (Landlord) was given by the state, they
              | have no own authority to doing this. They were only the servants of state; state didn’t serve
              | them as western Landlord served by their state. That’s why, after feudalism, western
              | Bourgeoisie was able to emerged rational bureaucracy during industrialization. But it was not
              | happened in Indian sub-continent.
              | Even in post-colonial Bangladesh, there is no any dominant class who can materialize
              | the state bureaucracy to establish their well-being. In that sense, the interpretations of state
              | bureaucracy in Bangladesh by Hamza Alavi and Anupam Sen are quite applicable;
              | Indigenous bourgeoisie are underdeveloped and state bureaucracy is autonomous as well as
              | state bureaucracy is stronger than the social classes now and long before these societies
              | were colonized.
              | Maw Weber identified precise distinguishes between Patrimonial and Rational
              | Bureaucracy by observing Europe and Asian societies. Dr. Aupam Sen specified that
              | differentiation by following ways which can be presented in a table (Sen: 1999) –

              | After the liberation war, in independent (post-colonial) Bangladesh, has a clear-cut
              | recruitment policy which is established for rationalizing bureaucracy on the basis of legal
              | authority. But what is the real scene exist in nature. It will be clear by understanding state and
              | bureaucratic nature in this country. In Democratic system in Bangladesh, Politicians claim for
              | power is based on popular mandate while that of bureaucrats on merit, competence and
              | political backing. (Anisuzzaman: 2012). One the other hand, politician need to pursue for
              | getting nomination for election to the bureaucrats. According to Zafarullah, ‘Bureaucrats can
              | have considerable impact on governance because of their ability to mobilize political support
              | and to apply or deny their administrative skills and technical expertise’. (Zafarullah: 1992).
              | He also added that it (Bureaucracy) is no longer the neutral instrument of policy
              | implementation in the hands of politicians.’ (Zafarullah: 1992). But in western bureaucracy
              | still remains structurally subordinate to politics. (Ahmed: 2009). In that context, the
              | theoretical explanation of Hamza Alavi is right; the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh is
              | autonomous. In the question of rational bureaucracy, P.K. Agrawal stated that any person
              | who enters the bureaucratic organization now wants to know what his authority is as regards
              | his domain of activities. Authority tends to power; power breeds ego; and ego creates
              | favoritism. …the ego may be different for different persons according to the environment.
              | Therefore, ego though purely an internal factor gets liked with external factors
              | comprising family and kinship, caste and religion, language and region, social economic
              | strata….. this leads to inaction legalized in many way. (Agrawal: 1995). But in Bangladesh,
              | persons enter into bureaucracy by pursuing others not on the basis on merit always. This is
              | defined the characteristics of nepotism in public administration in Bangladesh.
              | According to Jacoby, ‘He (Weber) considered official administrative activity as
              | separated from the private sphere of life, and as a condition which had developed over a long
              | period of time.’ (Jacoby: 1976). But in Bangladesh, official administrations are not free from
              | private sphere of bureaucrat’s life. Still it is difficult for Bangladesh to keep out from such
              | kinds of patriarchy nature of Bureaucracy.
              | The common features of Bangladesh Bureaucracy
              | In essence, the nature of Bureaucracy in Bangladesh shaped by irrational domination
              | historically. In independent Bangladesh, Politicization of Bureaucracy as well as corruption
              | in state bureaucracy emerged tremendously. According to Ishtiaq Jamil, `Bureaucracy in
              | Bangladesh is now caught in the tug-of-war between the major political parties, especially the
              | party and their allies in power. Their transfer and posting to suitable locations and positions,
              | their promotion, and career are now decided on the basis of their political loyalty. The
              | International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 7
meta          | 51
text          | process of manipulating the career of bureaucrats has also led to the division among
              | bureaucrats along party lines. He also added that, ‘Political connections are now considered
              | vital for promotion, transfer, posting and even recruitment’. (Jamil: 2007). In a recent study
              | on `State of bureaucracy in Bangladesh and its reform’, Shahidujjaman Khan elicited that the
              | bureaucracy in the country badly suffered due to politicization of the administration. He
              | found that promotions and transfers of the civil servants in the past were entirely on political
              | considerations and a large number of officers, having requisite qualifications, were deprived
              | of due promotions, which created a commotion in the civil administration.
              | He also added that `Bureaucracy has, indeed, a sweeping dominance in the state
              | administration of Bangladesh. The neutrality of the bureaucracy is critically threatened
              | because of undue influence by the political leaders. Such situation contributes to the
              | unfairness and poor distribution of public service, which tends to boost the practices of
              | corruption, collusion and nepotism.’ (Khan: 2012). He finds out three kinds of problems with
              | Bangladesh's bureaucracy –
              | First, as per Transparency International (TI) reports, Bangladesh is among the most
              | corrupt countries in the world. The performance of the bureaucracy in Bangladesh is
              | ranked the world's worst, along with those of India and Vietnam.
              | Second, there are problems with the overlapping structure of bureaucracy, vague
              | divisions between government functions and citizen obligations, and unclear political
              | process of policy formulation.
              | Third, there are problems with human resources quality.
              | Khan clearly mentioned that `Bangladesh inherited the system of bureaucracy from the
              | British that ruled Indian subcontinent for over 200 years. The UK government has reformed
              | the bureaucracy by completely transforming its civil service, making it more accountable to
              | ordinary citizens. Some other countries went for drastic reform of their civil administration.
              | Since independence, Bangladesh has had at least 18 proposals for reform in the bureaucracy.
              | Unfortunately, none of these proposals was materialized.’ (Khan: 2012)
              | By considering the theoretical explanation of Bureaucracy and above discussion, we
              | can summarize the features of state bureaucracy in Bangladesh in the given ways–
              | Measures of

              | The state bureaucracy of Bangladesh is patriarchal in nature. But, there are some

              | bureaucracy. In particular, documentation, accountability, recruitment policy, hierarchy and
              | division of labors of state bureaucracy of Bangladesh are legalized visibly. The skill of
              | bureaucrats in this state is questionable, where skilled managerial body was the precondition
              | of Weber’s ideal type of bureaucracy on the basis of legal authority.
              | On the other hand, the theoretical explanations of Hamza Alavi and Anupam Sen are
              | more applicable to understand the state nature and bureaucratic characteristics of Bangladesh.
              | Eventually, before and after independence, Bangladesh faced military rule in several times. It
              | caused the military influence in its bureaucratic organization.
