              | Abstract: »Datenintegration und Datenkonsolidierung von administrativen
              | Daten aus unterschiedlichen Quellen am Beispiel von Daten zum deutschen
              | Arbeitsmarkt«. This article introduces the data integration and consolidation
              | process of the research data base of the Institute for Employment Research.
              | The data are process generated data and stem from various, autonomous ad-
              | ministrative processes. This fact implies that there are manifold inconsistencies
              | between the data from the different data sources. This opens up the methodo-
              | logical problem of a successful consolidation of inconsistencies. Two con-
              | trarian strategies to handle this methodological problem are discussed and the
              | solution in the IAB-data base is presented.

              | 1. Introduction
              | Process-produced micro data today play an important role in research in social
              | science (cf. Jacobebbinghaus 2007). They are suitable for a broad range of
              | research objects like research on organizations, administrative processes, em-
              | ployment biographies or special sub-population in a society (cf. Scheuch 1977:
              | 22 et sqq.; Bick, Mann, Müller 1984; Schmähl, Fachinger 1994: 179 et sqq.;
              | Bick, Müller 2002: 230; Wallgren 2007: 4). Process produced data are defined
              | as data that are generated by diverse (administrative) processes and represent a
              | documentation of different actions (cf. Scheuch 1977: 25).
              | The linkage between the administrative process and the data it generates im-
              | plies that process-produced data necessarily are limited to a specific purpose. In
              | order to overcome these natural limitations in the process generated data a
              | combination of data from different data sources (and administrative processes)
              | is necessary. At a first glance this data integration and consolidation process
              | might look similar and typical for the development of research datasets. But

              | using and preparing process-produced data stemming from large administrative
              | processes poses some specific problems that are more complex those in data
              | from smaller data sources.
              | So this article deals with data integration and data consolidation in general,
              | but also depicts specific problems of the integration of large process generated
              | datasets. In the following we want to present as an example the research data
              | genesis of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) data base that trans-
              | forms and integrates data originating on the operational level of the appropriate
              | administrative process of the Federal Employment Agency (BA) to datasets
              | that are well fitted for research.
              | The above mentioned problems are not only technical but also methodologi-
              | cal problems. The integration of data stemming in case of the IAB data from at
              | least four different fields of administrative processes, two different institutions
              | and, coming with that, minimum four different operational IT-systems1 requires
              | a dealing with inconsistencies in the data. So the methodological problem of
              | how to deal with not integrated and inconsistent process generated data when
              | creating a integrated research data base will be discussed and two diverging
              | solutions will be presented.
              | All this information high lightens the background of the IAB data base and
              | provides necessary knowledge for the usage of process produced data in gen-
              | eral and especially the IAB research data, contributing to a better understanding
              | of the data and data production process as it is proposed by Bick and Müller
              | (1984: 145; cf. Wallgren 2007).
              | Before describing the data generation and the resulting problems the IAB re-
              | search data base will be presented to ensure a better understanding of the fol-
              | lowing problems. This integrated research data base can serve as an example
              | for integrated process data bases of various sources and fields.
              | 2. Data Base of the Case Study: The IAB data
              | The IAB research data base consists in general of four different data sources
              | and administrative processes covering the four main fields of the German labor
              | market. These four fields are (a) employment, (b) job-search, (c) unemploy-
              | ment benefit recipience (unemployment insurance and basic income support)
              | and (d) active labor market policies. The data are collected in different and
              | autonomous operational IT-systems.
              | 1 In fact many more operational IT-systems were and currently are in use by the BA to
              | administer and register process data, but we use in this article only the three main ones used
              | for BA-based research data.

text          | 2.1 General Problems Arising When Integrating Data
              | In a first step the data of each data source are consolidated and for each data
              | source a research data product is generated. In a second step these different
              | data sources are integrated to one data set. This large and comprehensive re-
              | search data base is called the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB). In the
              | last years many analyses of a broad range of aspects of the German labor mar-
              | ket were based on the IEB. For more details on the IEB and the access to this
              | data set, see Jacobebbinghaus 2007.
              | For a broader understanding of the presented IAB-data the four main data
              | sources will be briefly introduced. Job-seeking data, unemployment benefit
              | recipient data and data on measures of active labor market policy programs
              | stem from the Federal Employment Agency itself and its operational IT-
              | systems. These data are produced in the appropriate administrative processes.
              | They are registered on the operational level in the belonging IT-system and
              | then stored in the central pool of BA-business data. This data pool provides the
              | data which are transformed and integrated by the IAB in order to build up its
              | research data base.
              | In this process a whole set of problems can arise that also can be found in
              | many other data integration processes. Some important problems are discussed
              | in the following:
              | - Inconsistent information for one person: It is important to notice that there
              | is nearly no cross-validation of information between the different opera-
              | tional IT-systems during the registration process. Therefore inconsistent in-
              | formation for one person (e.g. differences in nationality) can be registered.
              | - Identifier (ID) of a person: A second dimension of the autonomy of the
              | different IT-systems is related to the identifier (ID) of a person. Different
              | IT-systems and administrative processes do have different identifiers so that
              | one person may have two or more identifiers.
              | - Data Structure: In principle the data structure in all data sources is similar.
              | All the data are spell data. But coverage and composition of these spell data
              | differs between the data sources. For example a spell in the data coming
              | from the social insurance system maximal covers one year, whereas spells
              | stemming from the unemployment benefit recipient system might be much
              | longer.
              | - Time-Span Covered: The maximum time span covered in the data depends
              | on the underlying administrative process. Some data sources already exist
              | for decades, reaching back to the 1970s. This results in manifold problems
              | that can cause breaches in the long time-series, like changes in legislation or
              | the IT-systems, etc.
              | - Different Target Populations: The administrative processes providing the
              | data are focussed on their special purpose and therefore target a specific
              | group of persons. This implies that only information relevant for that purpo-
              | se are registered and even further, that the meaning of the information is col-
meta          | 217
text          | lected purpose-dependent. Therefore in the process generated data see-
              | mingly similar attributes might have different, process dependent values and
              | meanings.
              | 2.2 Data Structure
              | The three BA-related data sources use the BA-client-number (KNR) as the
              | main identifier for a person. The data consist of spell data, which means indi-
              | vidual, daily and historical information, that show the different states of infor-
              | mation over time. Included are client characteristics and different administra-
              | tive purpose dependent information (e.g. target job in job-seeking information,
              | amount of unemployment benefits per time period in unemployment benefit
              | recipience, etc.).
              | In the case of job-seeking data this means individual, daily and historical in-
              | formation covering the time period since 2000 up to today, the different states
              | of job-search and information about personal attributes like sex, date of birth,
              | reasons for job-search, target job, etc.
              | Data stemming from the administration of active labor market policy pro-
              | grams also consist of individual, daily and historical information covering the
              | time period since 2000 up to today. Information about personal attributes like
              | sex, date of birth and information about the participation in the measure of
              | active labor market policy is provided (e.g. duration of participation, outcome,
              | etc.). Nearly all existing measures of active labor market policy since 1999 are
              | covered in the data.
              | A significant longer time series can be found in the unemployment benefit
              | recipient data. Here the spell data go back to 1975, so that more than 30 years
              | are covered. The data show information about the unemployment insurance
              | system. This means that only persons that were employed for a certain amount
              | of time before becoming unemployed can be found in the data. The data show
              | on a daily basis client characteristics, information about benefit recipience (e.g.
              | amount of transfer per period), reasons for exiting the unemployment benefit
              | recipient system and much more.
              | The youngest data source is the basic income support system data, which
              | was founded by the introduction of the Social Code 2 (SGB II) in 2005. Since
              | then there is a second kind of benefit recipience information coming from the
              | administrative procedures of the basic income support system. The information
              | found here is similar to the information in the unemployment benefit recipient
              | data, but does have another target population and a different benefit logic – this
              | system is a means-tested benefit system and in most cases it is conjointly ad-
              | ministered by the BA and the municipalities.
              | Beside these data coming more or less from BA related processes, there is
              | another large data source stemming from a completely different institution. The
              | IAB hosts German employment data coming from the social insurance system.
meta          | 218
text          | So this data shows social insured employment in Germany, but no self-
              | employment and no civil servants. It is important to notice that these data are
              | produced by completely different institutions, institutions that are completely
              | unrelated to the BA (see also Meyer, Mika and Thorvaldsen, in this Special
              | Issue). The pension and health insurance institutions therefore use their own
              | person identifier, the social security number. Analog to the unemployment
              | benefit recipient data, the employment data start in 1975 and today end in
              | 2007. The data consist of spell data, providing daily, historical and individual
              | information about employment. Available information are personal characteris-
              | tics, employment times, remuneration, occupation, etc.
              | 3. Data Generation and Institutional Bias
              | After the brief introduction of the most important parts of the IAB research
              | data base, a closer look to the data generation process is necessary. This is
              | essential, because these data, used for social research, are produced in a “for-
              | eign” – non scientific – context. The research data in this understanding repre-
              | sent a secondary usage of data that are collected for administrative purposes.
              | Therefore administrative data being used as a research data source represent a
              | data source of unobtrusive measures (cf. Best 2003: 112). To understand the
              | research potentials and risks in the data background knowledge about the data
              | generation process, situation and setting is required. Also important is knowl-
              | edge about the administrative processes in which the data are collected (cf.
              | Bick, Müller 1984: 123; cf. Wallgren 2007: 180). In order to give here a short
              | impression of such background knowledge the genesis of the research data
              | from the operation registration to the finished research data set will be outlined.
              | Figure 1 shows the way from operational level to the research data using job-
              | seeking data as example.
              | In the first step of the process the job-seeker communicates with the BA-
              | agent in the placement service. The job-seeker is obliged to give information to
              | the agent and these are only information relevant for the administrative process
              | of job-placement. Some information are registered in the face-to-face situation
              | of agent and client, so that the agent simultaneously has to communicate with
              | the client and register data in the operational IT-system - and all that possibly
              | under time pressure. This stressful situation has some implications on data
              | quality. There might be some errors in the registered information and informa-
              | tion more important for the placement process (e.g. occupational information)
              | will be registered and checked priorly.2
              | 2 This is a general factor in administrative data. Process produced research data always are
              | determined by the specific administrative system upon there are based (cf. Wallgren 2007:
              | 176).
meta          | 219
text          | Figure 1: Model of Data Flow
              | 3.1 Lack of Cross-Consolidation
              | Another important point to notice is, that the IT-system is directly linked to the
              | appropriate administrative process. So information concerning job-search is
              | registered in the job-search IT-system (called VerBIS), information for the
              | benefit recipience process in the benefit recipient IT-system. As mentioned
              | above, there is nearly no validation of information by cross-checks between the
              | different autonomous IT-systems.
              | After the registration and storage in the operational IT-systems some infor-
              | mation is transferred to the central pool of BA business data. The pool centrally
              | stores important data from the operational IT-systems and therefore includes
              | data from all operational IT-systems of the BA plus some more selected data
              | like employment data. It is important to notice, that the data are stored cen-
              | trally, but are not integrated.
              | This data pool provides the base data used for creating the IAB data prod-
              | ucts. The data integration and consolidation work in order to build up the re-
              | search data base is done by the IAB itself. The following graphic shows this
              | explicitly:
meta          | 220
text          | Figure 2: Model of Data Sources
              | In this picture the pillar principle in the BA-data is made visible. The differ-
              | ent administrative processes have appropriate operational IT-systems that work
              | more or less autonomous. In the database of the BA the data are centrally
              | stored but not integrated. This step is done by the IAB when creating an inte-
              | grated person centered database. Some more steps in the IAB data production
              | process are not illustrated above, but it should be clear that our methodological
              | problem of dealing with inconsistent information has be solved before an inte-
              | grated research data base can be built up.
              | In the next part three typical data problems will be presented and some ex-
              | amples for solutions are given:
              | 1) The problem of the identification and integration of a person in the data will
              | be illustrated.
              | 2) Possibilities of consolidation of inconsistent information will be presented.
              | 3) Some remarks about the problems resulting from long time series data will
              | be made.
              | 4. Integration and Consolidation of Data on a Single Person
              | As shown above the IAB integrates data from different sources. With that
              | integration comes the need for consolidating manifold inconsistencies in the
              | data. For example a person might have different nationalities at the same point
              | of time in data source A and data source B.
              | A precondition for the dealing with inconsistent information is the identifi-
              | cation of a comprehensive person. Only if one knows that person A in data
              | source A is the same person as person B in data source B a consolidation of
              | information between both data sources can be done.
meta          | 221
text          | So the first thing to be done is that person identification. Now why should
              | that be a problem? As already mentioned different IT-systems use different
              | person identifiers. We have at least two identifiers per person – the BA-client
              | number (KNR) and the social security number (VSNR). In both cases it is
              | possible that one person has more than one of those identifiers.
              | 1) BA-Client Number (Kundennummer, KNR): Until 2003 the BA-client num-
              | ber was decentrally assigned by the different BA-agencies. Each agency of
              | the BA (more than 270 in Germany) assigned its own number after a person
              | entered the administrative process. That means that after changing the agen-
              | cy because of moving to another city a new number was assigned. A new
              | number also was assigned if a client after a longer period of absence could
              | not remember his old number and told the agent that he didn't have a BA-
              | client number. Another factor is the above mentioned stressfull registration
              | procedure. In this situation an already assigned BA-client number might be
              | registered incorrect. All these factors lead to the fact that a person might ha-
              | ve more than one BA-client number, either historically or even at the same
              | point of time. Another identification problem can be found in the historical
              | BA-data. Before 2005 more identifiers existed along with the BA-client
              | number. An example later on used is the BA-registration number (EGNR).
              | 2) Social Security Number (Versicherungsnummer, VSNR): The second major
              | person identifier comes with the employment data. The social security num-
              | ber is assigned by the pension insurance. For each person that enters an
              | employment that is covered by the social insurance system the pension insu-
              | rance assigns a stable identifier that should not change over the life course.
              | But here it is possible too that a person has more than one number.
              | All these problems result in the need for a stable, consistent and comprehen-
              | sive person identifier in the integrated IAB data. There are two possible strate-
              | gies to create that identifier:
              | 1) Known relations between the different identifiers in the BA data can be
              | used. By combining the already known related identifiers one person can be
              | identified as being one person in the different data sources.
              | 2) Known personal attributes like name, first name, date of birth and sex are
              | matched. If that matching brings a good degree of accordance it is plausible
              | that a person in two data sources actually is the same person.
              | In the case of the IAB data both possibilities are used and will be briefly
              | outlined here.
              | 4.1 Identifying and Checking Connections
              | In a first step all the given identifiers in the data are systematically checked for
              | connections. This is possible because in the different IT-systems along with the
              | primary ID of that operational IT-system other IDs are registered as secondary
              | information. An example for this are the job-seeking data. Here the primary
meta          | 222
text          | identifier is the BA-client number (KNR), but during the administrative process
              | the social security number (VSNR) is registered as well as a secondary attrib-
              | ute. This results in relations between the different identifiers in different data
              | sources. By systematically checking these connected information a person and
              | its different IDs can be identified.
              | The second step for identifying a comprehensive person is matching four
              | personal attributes and look for the accordance in that match. The second step
              | is possible because of a (redundant) storage of this information in different IT-
              | systems. The four already described personal attributes can be found in the
              | different data sources. And this step is necessary for avoiding wrong mergers
              | of persons.
              | The following example with fictive data in two tables makes this identifica-
              | tion process transparent. The fictive example consists of data of two persons
              | who are married. The data used are stored in two central table, the BA-Client-
              | History-Table and the BA-Client-Table. The identification process uses com-
              | bined information from both table. The example consists of three steps: First
              | related identifiers in table 1 are combined, second the related identifiers in table
              | 1 are combined with identifiers in table 2 and third the proposed combination
              | of identifiers are validated by matching personal attributes. In the end the two
              | persons are comprehensively identified.
              | The first table used in this example is the BA-Client-History:

              | 125
              | 223
text          | 1) In the first step the given relations between the IDs are used. Using the BA-
              | Client-History, VSNRs 13111080S611 and 52111080S613 are allocated to
              | the same person via KNR 14 in BA-Client-History. KNR 12, 14 and 17 are
              | also assigned to that person because of having the same VSNR.
              | 2) Taking into consideration the EGNR in the BA-Client-Table KNR 13 can be
              | related to KNR 12 via the identical EGNR 124. Therefore KNR 13 refers to
              | this person too.
              | 3) Going one step further KNR 15 could also be related to this person because
              | of the identical VSNR (see BA-Client-History). At this point the second i-
              | dentification step gets important. KNR 15 has a different sex, date of birth
              | and first name. When matching these four attributes no accordance can be
              | found. Therefore KNR 15 is identified as being a second person. Conside-
              | ring the BA-Client-Table EGNR 125 is allocated to that second person.
              | So in the end, linking the different related IDs would indicate one identical
              | person in all the given data, but matching the already mentioned four central
              | personal attributes result in an inconclusive match. Therefore we assume in this
              | case the related IDs would wrongly be linked. This results in the identification
              | of two separate persons. Person 1 has four different KNRs, two different
              | VSNRs and two EGNRs. Person 2 has one KNR, one VSNR and one EGNR.
              | This reduces the given five KNRs, two VSNRs and three EGNRs to two com-
              | prehensively identified and checked person-IDs.
              | 4.2 Identifying and Handling Data Integration Inconsistencies
              | Now that we have an integrated and comprehensive person, the integration of
              | the data can begin. In this step of the data production process inconsistencies in
              | the data become visible. As mentioned above, there is nearly no cross-checking
              | of the data during the data registration process. So in the administrative process
              | only few of the registered information in the different IT-systems are validated
              | by comparing information between the different operational IT-systems. This
              | can lead to inconsistencies. For example one person can be registered as being
              | employed and unemployed at the same point of time, because these two status
              | information are raised by two different administrative institutions (pension
              | insurance and BA). But this also can happen in the BA data, when different
              | administrative processes and IT-systems are used. The following figure, show-
              | ing visualized spell data along the time axis from left to right, illustrates this
              | fact:
meta          | 224
text          | Figure 3: Spell data
              | BeH: Time of employment | ASU: Time of job-search | LeH: Time of unemployment
              | benefit recipience | MTG: Time of participation in active labor market policy programs
              | It can be seen that different data sources and states do have overlapping time
              | periods. On a first glance it is not clear which overlaps are plausible and which
              | are implausible. Under some premises overlapping times of employment and
              | job-search are allowed, but under other circumstances they are not. So legal
              | background knowledge is required to decide which overlapping spells should
              | be consolidated and which have to remain overlapping. A consolidation rule
              | would have to account for all possible (and impossible) overlapping times and
              | inconsistent states and information. A good example for those rules would be
              | the consolidation of employment times and times of unemployment benefit
              | recipience (SGB III). In general parallel times in this case are forbidden. But if
              | the employment does not exceed a certain amount of working hours per week,
              | parallel times of (small part time) employment and benefit recipience is al-
              | lowed. On the other hand full time employment parallel to benefit recipience is
              | not allowed under any circumstances. Here the exact knowledge of the legal
              | background is required to decide about the correct consolidation.3
              | 3 It has to be noticed that such a combination of forbidden states might also be an indication
              | of benefit abuse. In any case, if data error or benefit abuse, only an exact knowledge of the
              | background information together with a sound analysis of the data itself allow an adequate
              | interpretation and consolidation of the data.
meta          | 225
text          | All these sketched problems illustrate that a consolidation of data from two
              | different data sources perhaps might be possible, but developing consolidation
              | rules for more than two or three different data sources is very fast getting too
              | complex to do.
              | 4.3 Degree of Consolidation
              | Beside the complexity of the necessary consolidation rules a second fact has to
              | be taken into account. Consolidating data always means overwriting and there-
              | fore destruction of information. This means that there are two diverging strate-
              | gies concerning the consolidation of inconsistent data: Little consolidation
              | versus much consolidation. The strategies have direct implications for the
              | research that can be conducted with generated data base:
              | 1) Little consolidation, coming with a smaller loss of information but many
              | inconsistencies, generates more individual research options and more ex-
              | penses for data preparation for the researcher. Following from this is in a
              | broader variety of research results, but also perhaps disparate and incompa-
              | rable findings.
              | 2) Much consolidation overwrites information and this information is lost for
              | the researcher. A stronger consolidation results in structured data, thereby
              | also structuring the research options and minimizing the expenses for the re-
              | searcher. An error in the consolidation rules inevitably leads to misinterpre-
              | tations of the data, therefore possibly producing false research results.
              | One more problem in integrated administrative data will be presented here.
              | This problem is directly related to the result of a strong consolidation strategy.
              | Much consolidation leads to overwritten information. But in administrative
              | data a seemingly similar attribute can have more than one process dependent
              | meaning resulting in different ranges of values. Training is good example for
              | this problem. Information about the level of training can be found in diverse
              | data sources. But the exact meaning of the attribute “training” changes for each
              | data source because it is directly related to the appropriate administrative proc-
              | ess. In case of employment data the information in that attribute are related to
              | employment, therefore more oriented on the level of education of the person. In
              | the case of job-seeking data the seemingly same attribute has a different range
              | of values and these values are skill-level oriented. That is the case because the
              | administrative purpose is job-search where the skill-level is the important in-
              | formation. In such cases often it is impossible to correctly transcode the differ-
              | ent information, so the process related information has to be kept in the data.
              | 4.4 Handling Long Time-Series
              | The fourth subject to be discussed here is the time dimension of the data. As
              | mentioned in chapter 2 the available time series of employment and benefit
              | recipient data starts in 1975. This means legal configurations could have
meta          | 226
text          | changed and in fact did change over the last 30 years, as well as the administra-
              | tive practices, the IT-systems, etc. Even formerly forbidden states in the data
              | today could be allowed or vice versa.
              | Such long time series in process generated data provide special challenges.
              | The mentioned changes in the legislation, changes in the administrative proc-
              | esses and practices and changes in the operational IT-systems all result in
              | breaches in the time series of the historical data. Moreover the classification of
              | occupation and economic sector, the range of values in attributes and the re-
              | gional information can and will change over time. Another big challenge poses
              | the old documentation, that is rudimental at best. Getting background informa-
              | tion regarding IT-systems or administrative practices from documentation from
              | the 1970s or the 1980s is nearly impossible. The experts from that times are
              | retired and therefore the knowledge is inaccessible.
              | So, concerning historical data, there is no golden or general rule for han-
              | dling the data.
              | In the case of changes in legislation or changes in the IT-systems the
              | smoothing of the breaches depends on the dimension of the change. A breach
              | in the time series is inevitable if an exact mapping of information from the
              | older data structure to the newer one is impossible. This is due to the fact that
              | without an exact mapping the transformation of older information into the
              | newer data structure would mean a massive and back dated overwriting of
              | information. It also would mean to inscribe data from the newer situation into a
              | different historical situation. Therefore the changes in the data only can be
              | documented if an exact mapping is not possible. This leaves the researcher free
              | to decide how he interprets and deals with the breaches.
              | The same fact holds true for changing ranges of values in attributes. A good
              | example for that is the classification of economic sectors. This classification
              | changed three times in the last fifteen years. In two cases an exact one to one
              | mapping of old classification to new classification was not possible. In the last
              | change in about 30% of the old classifications the mapping to the new classifi-
              | cations is inconclusive. This implies that there is no possibility to consolidate
              | the data. The solution here can only be describing and documenting the
              | changes. A researcher using the data can choose himself how to deal with this
              | breach in the time series of the data.
              | Another strategy is used when regional information have to be integrated,
              | consolidated and updated. Regional information in many cases can be mapped
              | to the newest status. This is possible because for any case of change in the
              | dimension of the municipalities, there exists an exact mapping of old regional
              | information to new regional information. An example for this would be the
              | reformation of the size of districts in eastern Germany in the mid-1990s or in
              | Saxony in 2008. In each case it is clear which part of district went to which
              | new district or which districts were merged. This administrative information is
meta          | 227
text          | available and hence can be used to consolidate the regional information when
              | producing the integrated IAB data base.
              | Summing up the remarks concerning historical data, it can be said that in
              | general a smoothing of the breaches in the long time series in the data is not
              | possible. Therefore the main focus lies on the exact documentation of known
              | facts and eventually of background knowledge.
              | 5. Conclusion
              | To sum up the general guidelines, applicable for data errors stemming from
              | the data registration process as well as problems in time-series, the following
              | facts are consolidated:
              | - only valid values of an attribute are used
              | - only valid dates are used (e.g. start date < end date)
              | - filters and default values in the operational IT-systems are documented as
              | far as they are known
              | - some central personal attributes like sex and date of birth are consolidated
              | on the basis of the identification of a comprehensive person
              | - background knowledge and important legal or procedural knowledge is
              | documented
              | This brings us to the answer of the general methodological questions asked
              | in the introduction. There is no golden rule how to deal with inconsistencies in
              | the data, because each problem solving strategy has specific implications and
              | consequences. And these are general ones. An adequate answer to the question
              | of data integration und consolidation can only be an individual one and de-
              | pends on the specific project. But the consequences of each strategy always
              | have to be kept in mind.
              | Our philosophy emphasizes weaker consolidation rules favoring documenta-
              | tion instead of hard data consolidation. This leaves more degrees of freedom to
              | the researcher, enabling him to make the necessary decisions in data cleansing
              | by himself and fitting to his priorities. The IAB research data base therefore is
              | backed up by detailed and extensive documentation – a documentation that is
              | essential to know when working with this research data base. And this strategy
              | is applicable for other research data too.
              | The IAB data integration and consolidation processes result in standardized
              | research data products, covering the complete targeted group with nearly no
              | item- or unit-nonresponse, gaps in retrospection, selective retention or recall
              | errors. On the other hand the data quality especially of data from the 1970s or
              | 1980s is hard to grasp and, being administrative data, the data lack information
              | on household, attitudes, preferences, etc.
              | The philosophy of data preparation in this data implies that only in clearly
              | defined cases consolidation is done. The emphasis lies on documentation of the
              | facts and background information. Therefore a good knowledge of the data
meta          | 228
text          | generation process, its problems and framework is required and essential for
              | using the full potential of the data.
