              | Abstract
              | This paper examines fatherhood from an intergenerational perspective, focussing on
              | men who grew up in very different societies namely Ireland and Britain and who were
              | fathers in two different historical periods; an older generation who came to the UK
              | from Ireland between the 1940s and 1960s, and their adult sons who were born in the
              | UK in the 1970s and who also became fathers of sons. It analyses the context of mi-
              | gration, and its implications for continuity and change across the generations in rela-
              | tion to social mobility and models of fatherhood and demonstrates how a strong work
              | ethic and the cultural resources of religion and Irish ethnicity are transmitted to the
              | next male generation. The data are drawn from a British study in which thirty genera-
              | tional chains of men were interviewed. The study adopted a biographical approach. In
              | the context of this wider data set and particularly that from the Irish families the expe-
              | riences of one Irish family are used to illustrate the transmission processes involved.
              | In the family discussed, the cultural resources of an ambitious Irish mother and the
              | strong work ethic of both parents produce upward occupational mobility in the second
              | generation. The higher occupational status of the father is however played out via a
              | male breadwinner model of fatherhood in which the father, like his own father, is
              | driven by work.

              | nämlich in Irland und Großbritannien, aufwuchsen und ihre Vaterschaft in unter-
              | schiedlichen historischen Kontexten wahrnahmen: eine ältere Generation, die zwi-

              | emigrierte, und die Generation ihrer erwachsenen Söhne, die in den 1970er Jahren im
              | VK geboren und ebenfalls Väter wurden. Der Artikel analysiert den Migrationskon-

text          | Introduction
              | This article sets out to understand the context and influences of Irish migration to
              | Britain in relation to men’s family lives over two generations. The lives of the older
              | generation, referred to henceforth as the grandfathers, were shaped by the disruptions
              | and circumstances associated with being an Irish migrant between 1940 and 1960
              | while for the younger generation – the fathers – fatherhood was played out in the
              | 1990s and 2000s. The data are drawn from a British study in which thirty generational
              | chains of men were interviewed: eight chains of first generation Polish (migrant)
              | fathers, their fathers (living in Poland), and their sons (plus two chains of second
              | generation Polish fathers); ten chains of second generation Irish fathers, their fathers
              | (born in Ireland) and their sons; ten chains of white British fathers, their fathers (born
              | in the UK) and their sons who were aged 5-18. The study adopted a biographical
              | approach.2 The article focuses on one intergenerational chain. Firstly, it outlines the
              | approach to the study and briefly puts the migration of the Irish migrant grandfathers
              | in context. Secondly, it compares the life courses of the two generations and the social
              | and economic conditions in which the lives of the grandfathers and fathers unfold.
              | Thirdly, it explores men’s accounts of transmission. Finally, it discusses the ways in
              | which the experience of migration from a poor rural society plays out in the lives of
              | the second generation of fathers leading to upward social mobility. It shows how past
              | family history is incorporated into family identity in a different structural context.
              | Despite their upward occupational mobility fathers reproduce similarities in fathering
              | practices to those of their own fathers and retain an Irish identity while putting their
              | own mark upon their identity.
              | Approaches
              | The study adopts a life course perspective (Elder/Johnson/Crosnoe 2006; Elder/Giele
              | 2009) in order to understand the experience of fatherhood in the context of the society
              | they live in (the history-biography connection, see Mills 1959). A life course ap-
              | proach examines change and continuity over time in individual behaviour across a
              | whole range of life domains highlighting turning points (Denzin 1989) or shifts of
              | direction. However, knowledge is not only sought at the individual level (Bertaux
              | 1997; Bertaux/Thompson 1997); individual accounts are interpretations set within a
              | social context of factual events (Bertaux 1997). Life stories add nuance to understand-
              | ing the collectivity of the group situating lives in their social and historical contexts.
              | In a study applying a generational lens, it is possible to explore how a group com-
              | pares with an historical cohort linked by particular experiences, as in the case of Irish
              | migrants, and the resources for fatherhood that are transmitted intergenerationally. As
              | Mannheim (1952) suggests, generational time is not only about individuals occupying
              | 2 The Biographic-interpretive Narrative Interviewing Method (Wengraf 2001) was employed and adapted
              | for the grandfathers’ and fathers’ interviews. In the first part of the interview, the informants were invit-
              | ed to give a life story. In the second part, they were encouraged to elaborate on salient
              | events/experiences selected by the interviewer from their initial narratives. Using a semi-structured ap-
              | proach, the interviewers then asked about specific issues if they were already covered. The analysis in-
              | volved an initial separation of the life histories from the interpretive accounts (Wengraf 2001). Atten-
              | tion was given to the narrative context including the interview encounter and present time frames
              | (Brannen/Moss/Mooney 2004).

              | a similar historical location, it is also about the creation of collective cultures through
              | which continuities and discontinuities are transmitted intergenerationally. Cultures
              | express the tensions between synchronic and diachronic dimensions of ‘linked lives’
              | (Elder/Johnson/Crosnoe 2006); how individuals make connections with others hori-
              | zontally on the basis of belonging to the same age cohort while also relating to other
              | generations across historical time (Mannheim 1952). The fact of belonging to a dif-
              | ferent historical location has consequences for the experience of being fathered and
              | the parenting of children. As Mannheim (1952) argues, the formative years of child-
              | hood and youth are critical in the shaping of common identities, albeit the same
              | events may not impinge on individuals and groups in the same ways. In experiential
              | terms generations hold “divided memories” (Giesen 2004, 22) so that memories of
              | different pasts shape perceptions of the present and the future.
              | Transmission between family and historical generations varies according to the
              | field in which generational processes occur (Kohli 1999). As emphasised by Bourdieu
              | (1990), the social context in which the idea of a “generation” becomes meaningful is
              | pivotal. Thus intergenerational ambivalences may be stronger in relation to disciplin-
              | ing children but weaker in promoting educational success. However, what passes
              | between generations in families, or is passed on, is often taken for granted since
              | transmission is what people do and is embedded in routine everyday practices and
              | relationships (Morgan 1999). The transmission of family resources and cultures can
              | be implicit as well as explicit (Bernstein 1996). The notion of “family habitus”
              | (Bourdieu 1990) denotes a set of dispositions related to particular practices which
              | may lead to regularities in patterns of transmission across family generations (ibid.). It
              | may involve “reasonable or common-sense behaviour” – forms of “spontaneity with-
              | out consciousness”, carried out without reflection or fuss by people who are operating
              | according to a “practical logic”, an embodied “feel for the game” rather than an ex-
              | plicit plan or strategy (Bourdieu 1975). In the sense that habitus involves “produc[ing]
              | history on the basis of history”, dispositions can be cumulative (ibid., 56) and hence
              | become evident in an intergenerational study (Brannen 2006). Habitus demonstrates
              | both the “principle of both continuity and discontinuity” (Wacquant 2008, 267).
              | Material and cultural transmission also creates, reproduces and transmits family
              | identities. However identities change over the life course and over generations as
              | family members seek to differentiate themselves from one another; that which is
              | transmitted alters as each generation makes its own mark upon what has been passed
              | on to it (Bertaux/Bertaux-Wiame 1997). A greater investment in the transmission of
              | identity is typically evident among those who fear the loss of cultural identity, as in
              | the case of migrants (Delcroix 2000). In this process ambivalences are created as a
              | new generation does better educationally than the parent generation generating new
              | class positions, dispositions and habits which may distance them from the parent
              | generation.
              | Intergenerational transmission involves the transfer of material resources and ser-
              | vices, aspirations, values, practices, social learning, and models of parent-child rela-
              | tions (Bengston/Biblarz/Roberts 2002). Parents’ socio-economic status and gender
              | play a key role in the transmission of values and aspirations through the internaliza-
              | tion of parents’ outlooks on and interests in life (ibid.), through communication prac-
              | tices (Bernstein 2000), through investments in children’s human capital (Bourdieu
              | 1986; 1990; Vincent/Ball 2006). Children may also seek to be similar or differentiate

              | 2008). Gender (dis)identification is especially pertinent affecting the emotional quali-
              | ty of parent-child relationships at particular life course phases.
              | The context of Irish migration
              | Ireland was a colony of Britain until 1922 when all but its six northern counties
              | achieved independence as the Irish Free State which went on to re-name itself Ireland
              | in 1937 and declared itself a republic in 1949. For most of its modern history Ireland
              | has been a poor and rural society with a strong pattern of out migration. In the after-
              | math of independence it withdrew into itself both economically and culturally and its
              | post-independence failure to develop accelerated rather than stemmed this migration
              | pattern (Garvin 2004). From the 1860s to the 1960s Ireland was Britain’s main source
              | of reserve labour (Ryan 2004).3 The 1950s and 1960s saw the largest outflow of peo-
              | ple from Ireland to the UK (Garvey 1985).4 Moreover, through Ireland’s history of
              | close contact with the modern industrial economies of the United States and Britain,
              | migration was part of Irish culture. In the West of Ireland where the land was poor
              | and migration heaviest, migration was part of a growing consciousness of alternative
              | futures. People lost confidence in their own culture and were increasingly influenced
              | by the market and material cultures of the large capitalist economies (Brody 1973).
              | As well as seeking work, Irish migrants were attracted by the bright lights of the big
              | cities (Walter 1999). Most Irish migrants came from the countryside and lacked edu-
              | cation and skills. In the years following independence most Irish children had no
              | secondary education and left school at 14; secondary education was not free until the
              | late 1960s (Garvin 2004). Coming from a rural society which had no welfare state, the
              | new migrants joined a very different society; they found work in big cities and in the
              | construction industry (much of which was casualised and unregulated with high acci-
              | dent rates), but they also had access for their children to free primary and secondary
              | education and other universal welfare benefits. Thereby they hoped to carve out a
              | better future for themselves and their families.
              | The life course of the grandfathers
              | All but one of the ten grandfathers in the study migrated between 1940 and 1960, half
              | from the West of Ireland. All but one had between four and nine siblings. For most
              | grandfathers the transition to adulthood came early in the life course (Barrett 1999).
              | They were expected to help support their families from an early age even when still at
              | school.
              | Those who migrated were in the main young and single but, with one exception,
              | too old to benefit from the post war free secondary education in the UK. Six grandfa-
              | thers left school at 14. One grandfather (of middle class origin) entered secondary
              | education in Ireland and another who joined his migrant parents in England. Those
              | 3 This was the second main migration wave; the first occurred in the 1840s following the Potato Famine
              | (Salt 2009, 56).
              | 4 Inflows into Britain were among younger people with the exception of the 1950s when the numbers
              | were split between 25-34 and 15-24 groups (Barrett 1999). In the 1960s the age range at in migration
              | widened.

              | who left school in Ireland went into menial, poorly paid jobs with no prospects. All
              | had siblings or other relatives who had already migrated providing them with
              | knowledge of job opportunities and some initial support in Britain. On arrival they
              | found work in the construction industry, the archetypal source of employment for
              | Irishmen in Britain, or in factories (Walter 1999). Several remained in the same occu-
              | pation and sector all their lives. Several of the men returned to Ireland at least once to
              | try to resettle but returned to Britain after only a short period. It was also not uncom-
              | mon to send their children back to Ireland. In one case, a grandfather was left in Ire-
              | land with his grandmother from the age of 8 to 14.
              | As migrants, few recalled experiencing discrimination themselves but commented
              | on the widespread discrimination against Irish people that existed at the time (Hick-
              | man/Walter 1997; Ryan 2004). From present vantage points most grandfathers con-
              | structed in their interviews ‘transformative biographies’ (Phoenix 2008) – presenting
              | themselves as having made something of their lives in Britain, and so dis-identifying
              | with the stereotypical portrait of Irishmen who fell on hard times (typically because of
              | the ‘demon drink’). Proud of being Irish several said they were grateful to Britain for
              | providing them with “a good living”, that is from the perspective of Ireland’s impov-
              | erishment at the time they migrated. By contrast their sons, from the perspective of
              | greater current economic affluence (both in Ireland and Britain), reflected on the
              | difficulties their parents had faced as migrants in a particular historical period in
              | which the Irish were strongly discriminated against for political reasons and on ac-
              | count of their “otherness” (accent), their low economic status and willingness to do
              | tough manual work.
              | Despite feeling they had done “well” for themselves in Britain, only one grandfa-
              | ther was upwardly occupationally mobile compared with his own father. Grandfather
              | O., whose father became a carpenter, qualified as a teacher. He was doubly advan-
              | taged in that he arrived in Britain at an age when he was obliged to attend school and
              | he also joined his parents who by then were able to support him while he completed
              | his education. He recalled how as a newly qualified teacher he sought advancement
              | but was forced to teach in Catholic schools in inner cities. On one occasion he went
              | for a teaching post in a private (public) school:
              | I could sense that I was a little bit almost like a black man there you know. I
              | could sense there was definitely – these were the governors, these were blue
              | Tories – bloke like me (with Irish name) you know, bloody hell, you know.
              | The transition to adulthood was marked by the disruption of family relationships, a
              | lack of qualifications, and the need to find their way in a new society hostile to mi-
              | grants. This in turn shaped the transition to fatherhood. As migrants they were free to
              | marry in the sense that they were no longer tied to the land and by local customs.
              | However, up to the 1960s, the percentage of the Irish population who was single in all
              | the younger age groups was the highest recorded in any developed country, particular-
              | ly among men (Hannan 2008). Many Irish migrants never married. Six out of the ten
              | Irish grandfathers became fathers in their mid-20s, early in the life course by Irish
              | standards (Hannan 2008). Because of factors to do with religion, marginalisation and
              | ghettoization in Irish communities, many Irish in Britain (all but one in the study)

              | visits back home.
              | Brought up in a strongly religious environment in Ireland, the lives of this genera-
              | tion were dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. Fatherhood was therefore predi-
              | cated on a Catholic culture influencing family planning and how they brought up their
              | children. Since the Church forbade the use of contraception, parenthood was expected
              | automatically to follow marriage. Eight of the ten grandfathers had their first child
              | within one year of marriage. However, compared with their families of origin this
              | generation had significantly fewer children; 3.2 children on average compared with
              | 6.6 in their families of origin.
              | Decisions about when to marry were influenced by the need for men to prove

              | and a major source of male pride:
              | I love working. I don’t like hanging around to be quite honest. I think if I was
              | out of work I would feel terrible, I really would. (Grandfather G.)
              | Being the main breadwinner in his family was “just a natural thing really you know”.
              | Grandfather G. worked all over the country in his job and sometimes had to stay away
              | from home for weeks at a time. Especially when the children were young, he did not
              | spend much time with his family:
              | … used to work Saturday and Sunday … used to work as much overtime as I
              | could ... you know hard bringing a family up when you don’t have much mon-
              | ey.
              | Grandfather M. recalled having to work long hours labouring on the motorways. With
              | hindsight and in the context of taking part in a study of fathers he reflected that he did
              | not meet the current standards of fatherhood:
              | At that time it was all about getting the money really to – put[ting] the food on
              | the table really ... and pay your mortgage. That’s really a big concern at that
              | stage.
              | Grandfathers also experienced financial pressures to support their parents and their
              | siblings back home, some continuing to do this over their working lives. Remittances
              | may have influenced marriage decisions and the timing of marriage although none
              | made this link.
              | In deciding to marry (and hence to have a family) they had to find suitable hous-
              | ing. Several described discrimination from landlords; they used to say at that time
              | “No blacks, no dogs, no Irish.” Starting married life meant living in single rooms and
              | sharing bathrooms. The two routes out of this situation were to be rehoused by the
              | council5 or to purchase run down housing and renovate it through drawing on their
              | own skills or the informal economy in the building industry. Since the grandfathers
              | (and their wives) moved in Irish circles not only in the workplace but also in Irish

              | communities, the Church and schools provided support for parenting. As one grandfa-
              | ther noted: “Being part of that community is kind of home from home with all the
              | attractions of a big city.”
              | The life course of the fathers
              | The transition to adulthood for their sons born in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s was
              | very different. While their fathers enjoyed a short period of youth, the fathers experi-
              | enced an extended youth period which was marked by social if not financial inde-
              | pendence – ‘young adulthood’ (Nilsen/das Dores Guerreiro/Brannen 2002). These
              | men’s memories of their childhood suggest security and stability even if money was
              | short. Several recalled growing up in poor housing in Irish communities, and attend-
              | ing Catholic schools where they met other second generation Irish. They also fondly
              | recalled annual pilgrimages made with their families to Ireland in the holidays.
              | The fathers benefited from better educational opportunities; they left school much
              | later than their fathers – all but one beyond the minimum school leaving age of 16.
              | All gained some qualifications and six a university degree. As a consequence, they
              | attained higher status jobs as the research evidence on second generation Irish in
              | Britain also suggests.6 Only one started in a manual job (in the construction industry)
              | but rose to a management position and gained some qualifications. The two fathers
              | whose fathers were in middle class professional jobs entered even more prestigious
              | professions.7
              | The transition to fatherhood of the second generation differs also. In all but one
              | case the fathers married at an older age compared with their fathers. Also most fathers
              | experienced a longer period between marriage and fatherhood than their own fathers
              | (two or more years following marriage compared with only one year for their fathers).
              | Like their fathers, most married Irish women and because of their religious back-
              | grounds most brought up their children as Roman Catholics and sent them to Catholic
              | schools.
              | In order to examine the processes underlying these generational shifts we now turn
              | to analyse the “case” of a grandfather, father and son. This case is typical in many
              | respects of the Irish chains of grandfathers and fathers studied (with the exception of
              | the middle class origin grandfather). It is however less typical in terms of the part
              | played by the grandmother.
              | Life course comparisons
              | Grandfather Seamas was born in the 1940s in the West of Ireland on a small farm, the
              | second of six children. The family lived in one room of a two roomed cottage. Sea-
              | mas’ parents had worked in England but returned to Ireland during World War II.
              | Seamas was seven when his mother died, leaving his father to raise six children, in-
              | cluding two toddlers and a baby. An unmarried relative was asked to come back from
              | 6 Longitudinal Study data of 1971-81-91 (Walter 1999) shows unusually high rates of upward mobility
              | for second generation Irish, especially those with two Irish-born parents.
              | 7 Despite social mobility considerable health disadvantage is reported for second generation Irish as for
              | first generation that is compared with white British (Williams/Ecob 1999). Harding and Balarajan
              | (1996) found health disadvantage to be unrelated to social class. However, little is known about those
              | second generation who do not identify as Irish.

text          | England to care for them.8 Aged nine, Seamas’ father left for England to work, re-
              | turning for visits once or twice a year. Seamas had few memories of his father: “It
              | was a hard, hard life, now I tell you.”
              | Seamas did not remember missing him; he had never seen much of him and any-
              | way everyone was in the same boat, “that’s just the way it was”. He remembered no
              | social life, no activities other than occasional games of cards on visits to kin.
              | Seamas’ life course is typical of the first generation Irish. His transition to adult-
              | hood came early. When Seamas was 13 his older brother left for England to find work
              | and a year later when he was 14 Seamas had to leave school. He helped run the farm
              | and did various odd jobs. Aged 17, Seamas went to England with a friend to look for
              | work. He worked on various large construction projects all over the country but based
              | himself in London. Some years later he bought a road making machine and became
              | self-employed. Intending initially to return to Ireland he got used to the “good mon-
              | ey”. Moreover, his family back in Ireland depended on his remittances.
              | Aged 23, he married an Irish girl he met at an Irish dance hall in London. He was
              | making good money in the construction industry but was not yet on the housing lad-
              | der. First, the couple lived in a rented room sharing the house with several Irish fami-
              | lies. Their first child was born there when Seamas was 24. After five years and a
              | second child the couple had saved enough money to put down a deposit on a large run
              | down property. By this time Seamas’ wife who was business minded was working
              | part time. Later, she set up her own building company, which was atypical both for
              | her time and compared with the other cases. This did not influence Seamas’ view of
              | himself as the family breadwinner, albeit it meant the family was relatively well off as
              | a consequence. The couple refurbished the property with help from family and friends
              | over several years. Work remained at the centre of Seamas’ identity; he worked long
              | hours, often seven days a week, with periods away from home. He was still working
              | at the time we interviewed him. From his current vantage point, his definition of a
              | “good father” has an old fashioned ring to it:
              | … suppose, make sure they’re provided and that they have everything they
              | want and looked after. That they get good schooling and ... they’re well reared
              | and looked after I suppose. They’re clean and kept well.
              | Seamas was proud of being a provider:
              | They have been to every country nearly in the world, you know what I mean,
              | around with school holidays and with trips and things that (inaudible) I never
              | even heard of, you know.
              | It was his wife, he said, who had influenced the children’s aspirations and career
              | choices and been the disciplinarian. Seamas positioned himself as “the easy one”.
              | Compare this life course trajectory with that of Seamas’ son, Willie. Willie, the
              | second of two children, was born in the 1970s. He attended the local Catholic primary
              | school along with many Irish origin children. On the advice of his mother’s friend, he
              | went to a “good” Catholic secondary school some distance from home and studied
              | 8 The female relative never married.

              | subjects compatible with his career choice in banking. Unlike his father, Willie expe-
              | rienced a “long period of youth”. At 18 he went to university. He enjoyed considera-
              | ble upward mobility through entry to the finance industry which was booming at the
              | time (the 1990s); he joined an Irish bank, drawing on the social capital of his Irish
              | heritage. There he met his wife to be, also of Irish origin.
              | Aged 29, the couple married and two years later their son was born (eight at inter-
              | view). Two more children followed. Willie became a father later in the life course
              | than his father and under much more favourable material conditions. By then, with
              | two incomes from a well-paid industry, they had already bought their own house.
              | Like his father, Willie’s life was driven by work. He too worked very long hours and
              | was often away from home and so lacked time for his children. However, despite the
              | fact that Willie had a university education and was in a management job, he and his
              | family continued to live within a stone’s throw of his parents where Willie had grown
              | up. He also sent his children to his former Catholic primary school.
              | The accounts of the two men mirror one another. Seamas said that communication
              | between them was limited when Willie was a child mainly because he (Seamas) was
              | always working, a pattern which continued into adulthood. Like Seamas, Willie did
              | not recall his father spending much time with his father as a child: “he was never
              | there”, noting the similarities with his own fathering: “they’ll be in bed by the time
              | I’m home.” Willie’s memory of his relationship with his father while he was growing
              | up confirmed his father’s account – “non-confrontational” and sticking to “nice easy
              | soft subjects which remains the case now”. Willie confirmed that his mother was the
              | driving force in his life: “Dad didn’t have a clue the school even existed.”
              | Both, father and son described living in different worlds on account of their work
              | and interests, using the same words. Seamas referred obliquely to differences in their
              | education and occupations “you know we’re in different worlds, kind of thing now”
              | while Willie noted:
              | … it was totally different to the world they came from – so they’re (parents)
              | both in construction. I went into the financial industry and um, I’m sure no
              | more than I didn’t know what they did – to a technical level they don’t have a
              | clue what I do.
              | While there are similarities in terms of their unavailability as fathers, Willie also sub-
              | scribed to some aspects of a modern discourse of “fathering” (Brannen/Nilsen 2006) –
              | in particular relational aspects such as communication, openness and closeness (Der-
              | mott 2008), while accepting that his fatherhood practice was confined to breadwin-
              | ning and involved little childcare and spending time with his children only at week-
              | ends.
              | I honestly think there’s more of a conscious effort for the father [today] to
              | have more one to one time with the children than previously and probably get
              | more engaged in what the children are up to and how they’re developing.
              | Willie considered himself “slightly more engaged” with his first born than his father
              | was with him at the same age, for example knowing more about his son’s school and
              | friends. At the same time, he suggested a similar segregation of marital roles for his
              | Fatherhood in the Context of Migration: An Intergenerational Approach
meta          | 277
text          | own and his parents’ marriage. He was however somewhat ambivalent about greater
              | father involvement, as were some other strongly work-focussed fathers of this genera-
              | tion.
              | While Willie spent little time with his children except at weekends, because of
              | greater affluence and his particular skills he engaged in a wider range of activities
              | (computers, physical activities and taking them out) with his children than his own
              | father had done with him. But unlike his father he was more educationally ambitious
              | for his children and thought he was stricter with them. However, it was his wife who
              | helped with the children’s homework.
              | Transmission between fathers and sons
              | Possible explanations for Willie’s rejection of modern fatherhood practice (though not
              | its ideology) and his defence of a traditional male breadwinner role include the life
              | course experience shaped by his family history of migration which created a need to
              | build a better life for himself and his family. A further clue lies in the cultural sphere
              | of ‘family identity’ (as part of family memory) which is marked in this family by
              | strong continuities. Given that original identities play a pivotal role in constructing
              | biographical continuities, it is significant that Willie did not break with religious tradi-
              | tion, that he married into an Irish family, that he still felt Irish, and that he stayed
              | geographically close to his parents.
              | The transmission of identity is however habitual and not necessarily open to re-
              | flection, as may be seen in the way Seamas responded to questions relating to trans-
              | mission in the interview. Seamas could not think what he had inherited from his father
              | nor how he had influenced Willie except that he wanted a better life for him, just as
              | his had been better than his father’s.
              | I didn’t want him to go out working like (inaudible) you know what I mean
              | working. It was great, he had school, he had a good childhood, you know what
              | I mean.
              | However, Seamas pointed to aspects of identification, claiming his children and their
              | families as Irish:
              | They’re all Irish, they’ve always you know (pause) they’ve always been round
              | with Irish and their friends here are Irish or Irish descent.
              | Seamas also asserted their similar tastes describing how father and son both enjoyed a
              | pint and watching Gaelic football together. Also striking is the fact that Willie contin-
              | ues to live near his parents in the same, now gentrified, community where he grew up.
              | But despite this communication between father and son was limited. Seamas com-
              | mented, emphasising the value he attached to ‘long hours’:
              | We don’t really, we don’t communicate much better now, no. Well I don’t see
              | him to be honest, he’s always – you know we’re in different worlds, kind of
              | thing now … but I mean he does his own thing. He works good long hours ac-
              | tually.
meta          | 278
text          | Julia Brannen
              | On the other hand, living so close Seamas helped Willie and his family with practical
              | matters. For their part, both, his son and his grandsons helped Seamas with comput-
              | ers. Moreover, close contact between the female generations was maintained.
              | Similarly, Willie suggested strong themes of Irish identity. He holds an Irish pass-
              | port and counted himself as Irish while at the same time integrating country of birth
              | and residence into his identity:
              | Depends if it’s convenient to be one or t’other. Um, yeah I would see myself as
              | Irish. But it depends on who it’s going to annoy most typically.
              | He remained a Catholic and a church goer, if an infrequent one. Willie gave a rich
              | account of the mainly cultural capital passed on both by his parents, referring to their
              | strong work ethic which he also wanted for his children. Like his father he spoke of
              | family resemblances (Mason 2008), noting his delight at having been stopped in the
              | street by someone remarking on his own son’s resemblance to his grandfather. He
              | also felt that he had inherited his father’s social skills (“social demeanour”) and he
              | identified with his father’s equal treatment of others:
              | I don’t give two hoots if you earn two grand a year or two million quid a year.
              | I will treat you exactly the same. I think that’s a big thing I’ve probably got
              | from him (pause) and then to a degree socialising in places that serve alcohol
              | is probably another major thing.
              | Among others, Willie saw his parents as role models for his children:
              | ... between us spending hundreds of hours a week with them (Mm) um, by the
              | way you act, by the way you talk – the views you have – how you encourage
              | them to discuss their views and develop their views – all of that will have a
              | huge consequence on them probably.
              | At the same time, he stressed that his parents did not intervene in areas such as reli-
              | gious upbringing or education.
              | For his part Willie said he had no fixed ambitions for his sons; he would like to
              | give them financial stability without handing everything to them on a plate. To some
              | extent his easy-going attitude is like his father’s:
              | My level of empathy is you know short of having a limb hanging off, you know,
              | I’m not really worried about what happens to you, because it’ll be all right
              | tomorrow ... (wife) thinks I’m an emotional retard.
              | Reflecting at the end of the interview, Willie showed his awareness of the historical
              | context which created discontinuity between his own life and that of his father. His
              | narrative demonstrates a detailed understanding of what it meant for men like his
              | father to migrate at that time, while he positions himself and his son in a very differ-
              | ent world:

              | ing, living in a room with two or three others who I may or may not know, and

              | sometimes he isn’t back till like two, three (in the morning) … which I get real-
              | ly annoyed with.
              | Michael gave a consistent and graphic account which confirmed what he saw to be
              | the negative impact of his father’s work on family life. In response to one of the inter-
              | view activity sheets concerning “Time with my dad”, Michael ticked the box “I would
              | like more time” and wrote down next to it very carefully “because I do not get to see
              | him often because he is at work”. Asked to complete the sentence “I like my dad
              | when – ”, Michael said cautiously: “When he (pause) when (pause) when he’s home
              | from work early. I don’t when he’s not home early.” He talked about having to pack
              | in lots of things over the recent bank holiday as his dad had to go to work the next
              | day. Michael also commented on the household’s gendered division of labour. Asked
              | about who did which activities in the home, he ticked few done by his father and was
              | rather critical of this, suggesting his father needed more practice, especially with
              | cooking.
              | There are also discontinuities here in ethnic identification in the third generation.
              | When Michael was asked “Where do you say you are from if someone asks you?” he
              | was disdainful about being asked such “nosy questions” but said that since he sound-
              | ed English he would say “English”. However, at the same time, he was clearly well
              | aware of his Irish connections.
              | Discussion
              | This paper has examined how historical circumstances and the migration experience
              | of first generation Irish grandfathers created discontinuity in the second generation of
              | fathers in relation to education and occupation. The case of an Irish grandfather and
              | son shows how the structural contexts of migration and countries of origin and in
              | migration play out over time and in family memory. Compared with their working
              | class counterparts in our study (Brannen/Mooney/Wigfall 2011) the migration experi-

              | ence of the Irish grandfathers put them initially at great material and cultural disad-
              | vantage in Britain: earlier transition to adulthood, less education, no qualifications,
              | less material or other support as young single men in Britain, concentration in a dan-
              | gerous industry, and the experience of discrimination. For religious reasons, the tran-
              | sition to parenthood followed closely on the heels of marriage and, because of dis-
              | crimination, was accompanied by difficulties finding suitable family housing. As
              | main breadwinners in their households, they described themselves as “absent fathers”,
              | a view influenced by their consciousness of present day normative discourses of “in-
              | volved fatherhood”. Moreover this pattern of fathering was sustained by a gendered
              | division of labour in which mothers ran the households and did most of the child care.
              | Unable to help with their children’s academic studies because of their own lack of
              | education, grandfathers looked to Catholic schools and religion to help them bring up
              | their children “properly”. On the other hand, because of their origins in a very poor
              | rural society they defined themselves in terms of a very strong male breadwinner
              | work ethic.
              | However, grandfathers did not pass on their own disadvantages to their sons but
              | gave them stable if not materially well endowed childhoods. In Willie’s case, as in the
              | other Irish cases, the spur to work hard was transmitted to the fathers through their
              | parents while encouragement to succeed in education came largely from their moth-
              | ers, especially in Willie’s case. The institutional context of Roman Catholic schools
              | was a further important feature which facilitated their educational success. Circum-
              | scribed by their Irish families, communities and religious schools, the changed histor-
              | ical context and institutional fabric in which sons grew up facilitated a different life
              | course pattern, enabling them to attain qualifications, and in the longer term high
              | status professional or managerial jobs (with one exception). This in turn led to later
              | transitions to fatherhood by which time fathers were established on housing ladders.9
              | However, despite their upward occupational mobility, the fathers (with the same
              | one exception) practiced fatherhood in a way not dissimilar from that of their fathers,
              | involving little responsibility or “hands on” caring for children. They were either sole
              | or main breadwinners in their households although, according to the discourse of
              | gender equality, they did not see this as important. Like their fathers, because of long
              | working hours they had limited time for family life, a pattern reinforced by the com-
              | mitment of mothers in caring for children and also by a degree of precariousness in
              | current labour markets. While the two contexts of employment differed, both male
              | generations experienced insecurity. The grandfathers were employed in the 1960s and
              | 1970s in the construction industry large parts of which were casual with little unioni-
              | sation or regulation (Clegg 1979 passim) while the fathers, employed in the 1990s and
              | 2000s, experienced widespread deregulation of the UK economy, bringing job insecu-
              | rity and work intensification into many higher status jobs (Lewis/Brannen/Nilsen
              | 2009). However the fathers’ higher educational level and income provided them with
              | many more opportunities which protected them in the context of unemployment.
              | As discussed elsewhere (Brannen/Nilsen 2006), structural context and change in
              | fatherhood practices are configured differently for different social classes. Commonly
              | middle class fathers today embrace the “new fathering” discourse of father involve-
              | 9 Since the 1980s, when the public housing stock shrank under Thatcherism and when council tenants
              | were given “the right to buy”, people aspired to buy their homes.

text          | ment and relationality (see for example Dermott 2008). So, too, the second generation
              | Irish fathers subscribed to this normative discourse. As in the case of middle class
              | Willie whose time at home was heavily constrained by his career, his upward occupa-
              | tional mobility was not accompanied by significant changes in his fatherhood prac-
              | tice. Only one second generation Irish father, a lone parent, shared the care of his two
              | children on an equal basis (with his ex-wife). Significantly he was in a low status
              | (administrative) job. In this case a succession of life course events led to a different
              | trajectory; a failure to fulfil his academic potential despite having gained some passes
              | in the General Certificate of Secondary Education examination which is taken at 1610;
              | a move away from Catholicism in adolescence; marriage outside the Irish community;
              | and difficulty developing a career. A decisive turning point was the break-up of his
              | marriage at which time he was faced with a critical decision namely to share the care
              | of his children and not to prioritise work.
              | The upward occupational mobility of the second generation raises questions about
              | how the families managed the structural ambivalence (Luescher 2005) between the
              | generations. In Willie’s case, as in all but one of the Irish cases, as a son of a migrant
              | it was the transmission of a will to succeed in education and the workplace which
              | appears to have been significant in reproducing particular fatherhood practices.
              | Structural ambivalence is also mediated via the transmission of cultural resources
              | which form part of the migrant family heritage in particular through the persistence of
              | a strong sense of Irish identity. Like Willie, the fathers’ “Irishness” was sustained in
              | their childhoods through growing up in Irish communities in the UK and annual pil-
              | grimages made with parents to Ireland in the summer holidays. Irish identity also
              | continued to be closely entwined with religious identity (Bruce et al. 2004, 13) but did
              | not preclude identification with Britain. Irish identity was transmitted between fathers
              | and sons sometimes through passing on Irish names; and importantly via cultural
              | performance such as going to church and cultural centres some of which pertained to
              | particular forms of masculinity; having “a pint” together at the pub, watching and
              | playing particular Gaelic sports, a mutual interest in Irish music. The two generations
              | also pointed to the transmission of gendered family dispositions and resemblances
              | manifest in references to similar appearance, character and manner, propensities for
              | sociability and competence in “talking the talk” (an iconic Irish characteristic), as in
              | the case of Seamas and Willie. These forms of transmitted cultural capital are the
              | means by which Irish male generations created a shared history in the context of the
              | migration experience.
              | At the same time, as in Willie’s case, structural ambivalences of social mobility
              | were not entirely reconciled at a personal level. Willie constructed his world as very
              | different from that of his migrant father, while also being conscious that this was part
              | of his heritage. There were therefore clear differences between the generations in a
              | Mannheimian sense. The second generation viewed their parents as members of a
              | particular generation which was shaped both by the harshness of their early lives in
              | Ireland and by their experiences as migrants in a hostile society in which they had to
              | work very hard “to get by” – issues which few of the older generation were willing to
              | dwell upon in their interviews. In that sense migration was a clear generational mark-
