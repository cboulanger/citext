              | NORTHERN DIMENSION:
              | PARTICIPANT
              | STRATEGIES
              | Irina Busygina, Mikhail Filippov
              | This article is devoted to the “Northern Dimen-
              | sion” initiative of the EU which also includes
              | North-West Russia, Norway and Iceland. It is noted
              | that the “Northern Dimension” in the theoretical
              | perspective can be considered as part of strategic
              | multi-level interactions between member-states of
              | the EU and Russia. On this basis, the authors ana-
              | lyze implications and effects of the strategic inter-
              | dependence of all the EU-Russia relation levels.
              | Key words: European Union (EU), Russia,
              | the “Northern Dimension” (ND), cross-border
              | cooperation, inter-regional cooperation, sub-
              | sidiarity in the EU foreign policy.
              | The EU “Northern Dimension” initiative was put forward by Finland in
              | 1997 and was first adopted by the European Commission as a strategy of the
              | EU for 2000—2003 in 1999. The key element of the “Northern Dimension”
              | is the development of cross-border cooperation between separate administra-
              | tive units of member states. In accordance with the EU documents, it in-
              | cludes the territories of Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Baltic States and
              | Poland, as well as Karelia, the Murmansk, Arkhangelsk, Leningrad, Pskov,
              | Novgorod, Vologda, Kaliningrad regions of the Russian Federation and
              | Saint-Petersburg.
              | The unique character of the “Northern Dimension” programme (ND) lies
              | in cooperation between participants conducted both vertically and horizon-
              | tally at several levels: the state, regional and local ones. For Russia, the ND
              | means an additional possibility to attract the attention of partners to the use
              | of resources located in underdeveloped areas, as well as to find joint solu-
              | tions to the problems of the Russian North-West cross border areas [2,
              | p. 180]. For instance: environment protection, transport and border infra-
              | structure, unemployment and healthcare problems and other issues.
              | The development of the ND is, to a great extent, an activity in the
              | framework of certain policies. But it has a distinct horizontal dimension,
              | where coordination plays a significant role. Interaction and coordination of
              | the EU instruments and international finance institutions can provide for
              | higher efficiency and lead to practical results, especially in funding
              | In 2003, the European Commission adopted the Second Northern Di-
              | mension Action Plan for 2004—2006. The second ND was aimed at contrib-
              | uting to the implementation of the Neighbourhood policy. Now, two partner-
              | ships are taking place in the ND framework: the Environmental Partnership
              | and Partnership in Public Health and Social Well-being (established in ac-
              | cordance with the Declaration adopted at the Oslo International Conference
              | on October 27—28, 2003). In four years, the Environmental Partnership has
              | proved itself an efficient multilateral cooperation mechanism with an ade-
              | quate financial base and project manager — The European Bank for Recon-

              | struction and Development. The total amount of funding is 1.8 billion euros.
              | Fifteen projects are being implemented in the Partnership framework that are
              | mainly financed by international development banks on a repayable basis,
              | while a part of finance is provided by the Special Environmental Partnership
              | Foundation as grants.
              | The first priority projects in the framework of the partnership are South-
              | Eastern sewage disposal plants in Saint Petersburg (completed in 2005), the
              | flood protection system in Saint Petersburg, the sludge combustion plant in
              | Saint Petersburg (completed in 2007), the environmental investment pro-
              | gramme for the Leningrad region; modernisation of housing and public utili-
              | ties in Arkhangelsk, Syktyvkar and Novgorod, the modernisation of central
              | heating systems in Kaliningrad and Murmansk, the organisation of waste
              | management in Kaliningrad, cessation of waste disposal into the Neva, the
              | Ladoga ecological programme, water supply in Kaliningrad and Vologda [3,
              | p. 31].
              | Though the ND initiative was highly criticized from the beginning, it led
              | to certain tangible results. Perhaps, its main advantage is the contribution to
              | the efficient involvement of Russia into European structures beyond the so-
              | called “high politics”. The interest in the ND, its implementation and theo-
              | retical experience are expanding beyond Northern Europe and immediate
              | participant states [6].
              | However, the ND initiative is not merely interesting in itself, but also in
              | the context of EU-Russia relations. From a theoretical perspective, the ND
              | can be considered an element of strategically connected multilevel interac-
              | tions between the EU member states and Russia. Researchers have repeat-
              | edly emphasised the principal importance of the multilevel character of rela-
              | tions between these actors. It concerns (1) relations between the EU and
              | Russian institutions; (2) bilateral Russia-the EU member states relations; (3)
              | cross-border relations and cooperation at regional (subnational) level [12].
              | Proceeding from this, we can take the next step and try to analyse the conse-
              | quences and effects of strategic interdependence between all Russia-the EU
              | relation levels in more details.
              | Our basic argument is that both actors interacting at numerous institu-
              | tional levels and balancing between them are trying to achieve different
              | goals at the same time. The key actors should take into account the conse-
              | quences of interaction at different levels, but at the same time they differ-
              | ently estimate the results of these interactions. Thus the choice or rejection
              | of cooperation strategy (or tactics) at one level can explain the character of
              | decisions made at other levels.
              | The EU-Russia Relations: General Context
              | Recently, the EU-Russia relations have developed in a peculiar manner:
              | there is a growing discrepancy between the actively developing trade and
              | foreign policy relations, which are approaching the ‘freezing point’. In 2007,
              | this discrepancy formed a steady tendency, since trade was developing to the
              | benefit of both parties, while the sphere of external relations was increas-

              | ingly taking forms unfavourable for Russia, significantly weakening the
              | international position of Russia not only at the present moment, but also for
              | the future. The middle of 2007 conceivably saw the transition to a princi-
              | pally new paradigm of the EU standpoints in its relation to Russia — Euro-
              | pean leaders admitted the inadequacy of the attempts to influence the re-
              | forms in Russia and started establishing mechanisms aimed at the elabora-
              | tion of joint solutions allowing neutralisation of possible negative actions of
              | Russia towards the EU.
              | The favourable vector of international relations development reached its
              | maximum in 1997 when, finally, the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation
              | Agreement, signed in 1994, came into effect. At that moment, the Treaty of
              | Amsterdam defined the constitutional (contractual) principles of the EU
              | foreign policy.
              | Relations with Russia were considered a general foreign policy project
              | that is characterised by the concordance of the member state objectives, At
              | the same time it would be a “pilot project” to test new mechanisms of the
              | interaction of the EU (as a body) with the outer world. It was crucial to find
              | such a project, because the difficulty of the EU common policy development
              | consists in contradictory foreign policy interests of different states, first of
              | all, Germany, France and the UK. But, since all the EU member states are
              | interested in the predictability of Russia, the provision of this predictability
              | is the most evident first priority project of the new common foreign policy
              | [1]. The Treaty of Amsterdam defined the EU “common strategies” in for-
              | eign policy as one of the most important instruments of the EU foreign pol-
              | icy. The first “common strategy” (adopted in June 1999) was the programme
              | aimed at the development of democracy and market competition in Russia.
              | In general, it was expected by means of joint efforts it would be possible to
              | influence Russia in the same way Western victorious powers influenced the
              | development of post-war Germany and Japan, aspiring to the establishment
              | of democracy and competitive market as basic tools of a predictable good-
              | neighbour policy. It is well-know that states with democratically elected
              | governments cannot allow themselves to be at enmity with each other.
              | In summer 1999, it could seem that Russia got an opportunity to benefit
              | from the interest of the EU states in the success of their first foreign policy
              | project aimed at the transformation of Russia into a democratic European
              | power, consistent with the common European rules. But soon after Vladimir
              | Putin had come to power, Russia started resisting the EU attempts to conduct
              | common foreign policy towards Russia. First of all, Russia tried to take ad-
              | vantage of the contradictions within the EU. But soon the attempts to take
              | advantage of the contradictions and, especially, to oppose ‘old’ Europe to the
              | new members of the EU proved to be counterproductive. It became evident
              | in 2007, when, unexpectedly for the Russian diplomacy, Poland blocked the
              | subscription of the new PCA planned at the EU-Russia summit in Samara,
              | which Russia had been aiming at for five years. The leaders of the Union did
              | not merely refrained from calling Poland to ‘order’, but at the summit itself
              | (which was not successful due to the Polish veto) Manuel Barroso, the Presi-
              | dent of the European Commission, firmly declared his support to Poland.

              | It is important to mention, that one of the peculiarities of the EU is the
              | fact that this intergovernmental structure is still undergoing the process of
              | formation. It defines, to a great extent, the foreign policy strategies of the
              | Union, which are motivated more by attempts to create conditions for the
              | further accretion of the power to make the EU a real actor of foreign policy
              | than by the EU foreign policy interests. Thus member states should reject the
              | most significant part of their sovereignty which needs serious stimuli. Now,
              | economic cooperation in the framework of the EU has almost reached the
              | level of a federative union; and the Union represents the interests of all the
              | member states. In other spheres, first of all, in foreign policy, solidarity is
              | limited: the principles of decision-making have an intergovernmental charac-
              | ter, i.e. a decision is made only if the member states reached an accord. It
              | means that the mechanism of formulating “common interests” in this sphere
              | has not been elaborated yet; there is only a “common denominator” of dif-
              | ferent interests.
              | The prerequisite — the EU has not formed a mechanism of formulating
              | common interests — sometimes brings Russian diplomats to the false con-
              | clusion that it is possible (and one should try) to take advantage of the con-
              | tradictions between the EU member states. At the same time they do not take
              | into account that for many European politicians the basic interest consists in
              | establishing common institutes (rules) of the EU foreign policy. Despite
              | different positions on certain issues, there is a collective comprehension of
              | the necessity to elaborate rules defining the future development of the EU
              | foreign policy.
              | However, the increasing political tension between the EU and Russia can
              | be ‘compensated’ by cooperation at other institutional levels. So, political
              | frictions at the highest level can stimulate the participation of the Russian
              | government in regional EU initiatives (such as the ND). At the same time, it
              | is crucial that, in order to succeed in this balancing between levels, the ND
              | context should be separated from the problem field of the ‘high politics’. In
              | this case, cross-border and interregional programme(s) will be more efficient
              | if they are concentrated around local and not political issues. One should
              | admit that such programmes are hardly applicable to such ‘highly’ politi-
              | cised issues as the development of democracy in Russia, the freedom of me-
              | dia, human rights, security and energy resource supply. In other words, ex-
              | perts working at both practical and ideological levels of the ND should con-
              | sciously avoid being involved in certain (political) problems.
              | It is possible to assume that if some actors choose the level of EU-Russia
              | relations in general as a priority; others will be interested in the development
              | of bilateral relations. So, the priorities of different actors will differ. In gen-
              | eral, it can be expected that the EU member states and subnational territories
              | (regions) will follow different and, maybe, contradictory strategies towards
              | Russia. Moreover, the same actor will conduct different strategies at differ-
              | ent institutional levels. For instance, Finland will act differently in the Euro-
              | pean Council, in the ND, and in bilateral relations with Russia. This lack of
              | consistency in EU foreign policy is a natural consequence of its multilevel
              | governmental structure.

              | The development of the ND is a good example of how the tension in the
              | ‘high politics’ do not restrict cooperation at lower levels. Different forms of
              | interregional cooperation in the framework of the ND achieved more signifi-
              | cant progress that it was expected by the critics of the initiative. Despite
              | numerous difficulties, the initiative was not seriously affected and involved in
              | the deteriorating relations between Russia and the EU and, what is most impor-
              | tant, Russia did not withdraw from the initiative maintaining its liabilities.
              | The Formula of Success: Small Steps of Small Powers
              | As Aalto shows [4], the ND was, first of all, an attempt to overcome the
              | increasing demarcation between the EU and Russia by means of finding joint
              | solutions to functional problems and not meeting at another ‘high politics’
              | battle field. Security and political issues were either excluded from the
              | agenda or discussed in brief. Maybe, the best decision was not to tackle the
              | issue of oil and gas supply in mass media. Only nuclear safety and energy
              | efficiency were included in the ND Environmental Partnership. The impor-
              | tance of the North for the EU energy strategy is understood by ‘European
              | bureaucrats’ perfectly well: “The Northern Dimension represents one essen-
              | tial frontier for security of supply due to the importance of Russian and
              | Norwegian energy supplies.” (The EU Commission 1999:11).
              | From the very beginning, the ND was oriented towards partnership and
              | equality approach, was open to equal partnership of non-EU member states.
              | As Lannon and Elsuwege point out: “The fact that these partner countries
              | have become involved in the process from the very beginning and partici-
              | pated in the Foreign Ministers’ conferences on the Northern Dimension is
              | rather unusual in the EU context. In other words, the partner countries were
              | expected to be not only policy-takers but also policy-makers” [9, p. 25].
              | Browning and Joenniemi [5] agree that openness to external participants is
              | indeed a peculiar feature of the ND. For all member-states this involvement
              | into the initiative grants an opportunity and grounds for the discussion of
              | urgent problems on the basis of equality. The equality and partnership ap-
              | proach almost guaranteed that the ND would deal with a certain number of
              | issues, ‘acceptable’ for all participants. And indeed, the ND, as a rule, con-
              | ducts functional cooperation in the field of ‘low’ politics.
              | Later, Finland started to make efforts to transform the image of the ND
              | — from a foreign policy to a cooperation project that equally belonged to the
              | participant states and the EU [14, p. 6]. From all the partner states only
              | Finland is a member of the EMU, but is still sceptical about a common de-
              | fence policy. For an outside observer, the ND may seem a project, in the
              | framework of which Northern European States try to separately build their
              | relations with the rest of the world and Russia in particular. The ND can be
              | also considered as a ‘Northern alternative’ to the eastern and southern vec-
              | tors of the EU development. As Trenin assumes [13] there is a possibility of
              | forming a new common global identity — the ‘Northern’ one.
              | It was repeatedly emphasized that the ND proves the ability of small EU
              | powers to achieve much conducting ‘smart small policies’. If in the case of
meta          | 51
text          | Development strategies of the Baltic region
              | Russia, it concerns the regions that actively participated in the ND activity
              | and success depended to a great extend on the interest and involvement of
              | local and regional (subnational) actors.
              | It is not a coincidence that such initiatives and projects are implemented
              | at subnational level — it demands, in addition, the technology of practically-
              | oriented cooperation. The attempts to harmonise and realise such projects
              | among national governments inevitably lead to significant transaction costs.
              | On the contrary, interregional contacts allow keeping costs low; cooperation
              | is developing as a ‘general practice’ beyond the ‘high’ policy context.
              | EU Foreign Policy Subsidiarity Principle
              | and Northern Dimension
              | The development of “dimensions” is a form of exclusion: partnership in
              | a certain dimension means that the state cannot count on full membership in
              | the Union [8, p. 7]. The ND has both northern and eastern elements. And
              | from the point of view of its eastern “geography” it is indeed a border be-
              | tween Europe and non-Europe [11]. If one understands the ND in this way,
              | then it is based in Brussels in the offices where the EU foreign policy is be-
              | ing elaborated [11, p. 97]. In other words, if one conceptualises the ND as an
              | element of the EU foreign policy, then it becomes a restricted regional part
              | of the common EU strategy towards Russia.
              | Alternative future for the ND could consist in maintaining a certain de-
              | gree of independence from the EU foreign policy; the ND already has impor-
              | tant innovations and is different from the traditional instruments of foreign
              | policy, which makes it easier to achieve autonomy. The ND is a combination
              | of the partnership, equality and multilevel approaches, and such a unique
              | combination creates a “special subsidiarity form” — the EU states formulate
              | and realise foreign policy in collaboration with external actors able to gener-
              | ate necessary ‘power’ to solve certain problems [7, p. 390]. Such subsidiary
              | allows the EU to conduct its multilevel foreign policy. On the other hand, the
              | most concerned member states can avoid the contradictions of ‘high’ politics
              | focusing on those fields of cooperation where the participation of regional
              | and subregional actors will lead to the creation of additional value (the
              | Northern Dimension Policy Framework Document, 2006).
              | The subsidiarity principle applied to the ND drastically differs from the
              | ideas of “two-speed Europe” and “Europe of regions”. Perhaps, it can be
              | easily explained by means of multilevel governance approach, which implies
              | that the actors can influence the decision-making process in the EU by nu-
              | merous means — from collaborating with European institutions to indirect
              | actions through regional, national and subnational bodies. The policy thus
              | formed is a result of overlapping jurisdictions, tensions and conflicts in the
              | multilevel governance system [10].
              | Applying this subsidiarity logic to the ND one can expect the process of
              | ‘localised’ decision making become decentralised, i. e. dispersed among
              | different institutional levels — regional, national, subnational; while supra-
              | national institutions will maintain responsibility for formulating the common

              | policy towards Russia. Thus, different questions will be located in the juris-
              | diction of different actor in dependence on their importance and presence of
              | common interest.
              | Let us mention, that the ND subsidiarity logic does not contradict (but
              | supplements) our argument put forward in the beginning of the article: the
              | key actors will define their strategies in accordance with, firstly, the general
              | context of EU-Russia relations, and, secondly, prioritisation at different lev-
              | els and concerning different issues. European (supranational) actors are more
              | likely to benefit from the participation of the ND in ‘high’ politics then the
              | participant states, subnational units and the Region in general.
