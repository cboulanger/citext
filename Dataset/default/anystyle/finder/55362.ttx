              | Abstract
              | In this article, we explore the relationship between public recreation policy and planning and the transformation of urban
              | governance in the context of the Police Athletic League centers in Baltimore, Maryland. In light of contemporary discus-
              | sions of the role of youth programs for sport and physical activity within post-industrial cities, the origination, development,
              | and eventual demise of Baltimore’s network of Police Activity League centers is an instructive, if disheartening, saga. It il-
              | lustrates the social and political rationales mobilized in justifying recreation policy and programming, the framing of sport
              | and physical activity as preventative measures towards crime and juvenile delinquency, and the precarity of such initiatives
              | given the efficiency-driven orthodoxies of neoliberal urban entrepreneurialism (Harvey, 1989). This analysis emphasizes
              | how the PAL centers were designed to ‘fill the void’ left by a declining system of public recreation, thereby providing an
              | example of a recreation program as part of the “social problems industry” (Pitter & Andrews 1997).

              | 1. Introduction
              | In May 1996, officials from different agencies and
              | departments—including the Mayor’s Office, the city’s
              | department of recreation and parks, and the police
              | department—gathered to announce the latest develop-
              | ment in the restructuring of Baltimore’s public recreation
              | centers: the opening of several Police Athletic League
              | centers (PALs). Over the previous 40 years, the city had
              | invested both capital and programming funds towards
              | an extensive network of centers operated by the public
              | recreation department. However, the PALs program of-
              | fered a different model of recreation: uncoupled from
              | the previous approach to urban recreation based on
              | publicly-derived funding and support, the PALs were de-
              | livered utilizing a public-private partnership model of
              | governance. In this mode, urban communities became
              | Social Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249
              | evermore underserved in regard to decreased public
              | recreation programs and facilities. As such, recreation
              | provision became one of myriad expressions of race and
              | class inequality, created by neoliberal processes of devo-
              | lution and privatization within U.S. cities. In this article,
              | the authors demonstrate that the PAL program should
              | be understood as a particular form of neoliberal inter-
              | vention within urban communities, one that has had spe-
              | cific impacts for the policy and planning of recreation in
              | Baltimore. The authors therefore adopt a contextual ap-
              | proach to studying urban governance via the “articula-
              | tion” (Slack, 1996) of policy and planning through various
              | political, economic, and social forces. This approach uti-
              | lizes a critical discourse analysis of over 500 documents
              | related to the Baltimore PAL program, including official
              | meeting minutes, planning and organizational documen-
              | tation, and annual and long-term reports from the city’s

text          | recreation department, as well as other sources of recre-
              | ation discourse: community organization flyers, recre-
              | ation programming forms, and media reports.
              | Rather than focusing on the provision of recreation
              | experiences and opportunities as a means of enriching
              | lives, the underlying assumptions behind the PAL pro-
              | gram mobilized recreation as a vehicle for intervening
              | into, and thereby looking to manage, the lives and bod-
              | ies of those always already perceived to be “at-risk” (not
              | only to themselves but, more importantly, to the wider
              | Baltimore population living within a climate of histori-
              | cally entrenched racialized fears and anxieties). In this
              | mode, Baltimore’s PAL program demonstrates one ex-
              | ample of sports-based interventions that are designed
              | to change individual behaviors, urban spaces, and so-
              | cial interactions between communities and policing or-
              | ganizations (Kelly, 2013), particularly in regard to “hard
              | to reach” (Crabbe, 2007) populations within cities. Fur-
              | ther, the PALs were also a “microcosm of American lib-
              | eral social policy” (Hartmann, 2016, p. 73), since their
              | very development, and ultimate demise, was inextrica-
              | bly linked to the shifting conditions and dynamics of
              | neoliberal urban governance. Originated as an innova-
              | tive public-private alternative to the perceived ineffi-
              | ciencies of the publicly-funded recreational model, the
              | inevitable fiscal crises that punctuate neoliberalism’s
              | modus operandi–and create legitimizing states of excep-
              | tion (Ong, 2006)—precipitated the inevitable disman-
              | tling of the PALs program as the neoliberal urban project
              | revealed its inherent unsustainability in the early 2000s.
              | Driven by the fear-mongering and self-interest driven
              | logics of what Edsall (2012) dubbed the “age of auster-
              | ity”, exponents of neoliberal urban governance orthodox-
              | ies were pathologically compelled to trim the excesses
              | of public service provision and programming. Following
              | Spaaij (2009), neoliberal sport-based intervention pro-
              | grams therefore have often included the potential for
              | social cohesion and individual opportunity, but are si-
              | multaneously “aimed at generating social order in disad-
              | vantaged inner-city neighbourhoods” both in the United
              | States and Europe (p. 252).
              | Although this article is focused on Baltimore’s Police
              | Athletic League program, it would be remiss not to pro-
              | vide a brief contextualization of the PAL more generally.
              | The roots of the PAL can be traced to the reformist pa-
              | ternalism of the early-1900s, specifically various initia-
              | tives by the New York Police which sought to use var-
              | ious forms of recreation to encourage good citizenship
              | among the city’s mass ranks of impoverished youth, and
              | nurture a positive relationship between this group and
              | the New York Police Department (PAL, 2015). By the early
              | 1930s, the social and economic turmoil created by the
              | Depression—and most pertinently the perceived threat
              | of rising rates of juvenile delinquency—intensified the fo-
              | cus on youth recreation programs as a mechanism for
              | crime prevention. Hence, the NYPD Crime Prevention Bu-
              | reau formed the Junior Police Athletic League in 1932,
              | which was reorganized into the Police Athletic League in
              | Social Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249
              | 1936 (PAL, 2015). From its early twentieth century New
              | York City origins, PAL programs have spread throughout
              | the U.S., oftentimes shifting programmatic structure and
              | focus as dictated by changing urban realities, and asso-
              | ciated policy priorities (i.e. the War on Poverty in the
              | 1960s, the War on Drugs in the 1980s, the War on Ter-
              | ror in the 2000s, and the War on Obesity in the 2010s).
              | Nonetheless, and belying the residual influence of its
              | socially reformist beginnings, the PAL program at its in-
              | stitutional core movement continues to mobilize physi-
              | cal recreation (play, games, and sport) as a vehicle for
              | building positive character traits. The program there-
              | fores utilizes recreation as a means for the adoption of
              | values which would, it is assumed, assimilate potentially
              | deviant poor urban youth into the social mainstream
              | (Wilson, 1994). PALs today are a vivid institutional ex-
              | emplar of what Pitter and Andrews (1997) referred to
              | as the “social problems industry”: a complex and di-
              | verse formation of publicly and privately-funded, for-
              | profit and not-for-profit, recreation-based crime preven-
              | tion and public safety programs designed to “serve”—or
              | perhaps more accurately regulate, discipline, or police—
              | America’s historically underserved urban poor. Within
              | the contemporary social problems industry context, “at-
              | risk urban youth” is a racialized euphemism for demo-
              | nized Black bodies and characteristics, whose patholo-
              | gized deviance renders them as being “at-risk” to them-
              | selves, to their communities, and–inflaming more polit-
              | ical purchase—to mainstream (read: White) American
              | society more generally (Cole, 1996). Programs within
              | more affluent suburban metropolitan spaces tend to
              | be justified through their provision of physical recre-
              | ation experiences–and anticipated physical, psycholog-
              | ical, and social benefits–to suburban (read: deserving)
              | youth (Pitter & Andrews, 1997).
              | While doubtless realizing many of these outcomes,
              | programs such as the PALs explicitly targeting the prob-
              | lematized urban poor are never far removed from what
              | populist conservative thinking considers to be such pro-
              | gram’s raison d’être: using physical recreation interven-
              | tions as means of “controlling and/or containing pop-
              | ulations…seen as either ‘at-risk’ or socially disruptive”
              | (Hartmann, 2012, p. 1011). However, while its disciplin-
              | ing logic has been unwavering, the very structure and
              | delivery of the various components of the social prob-
              | lems industry is contingent upon the shifting ideologies
              | and policies of urban governance. Hence, as we demon-
              | strate within this discussion, Baltimore’s PAL centers ul-
              | timately became soldiers of fortune to the mode of ne-
              | oliberal urban entrepreneurialism that increasingly dom-
              | inated the governance of U.S. cities, such as Baltimore,
              | from the 1980s onwards (Harvey, 1989). Below we de-
              | tail the emergence of the social problems industry and
              | the relationship between recreation and social inclusion
              | in the late 20th century, before analyzing the scale and
              | scope of the PAL program as a particular form of interven-
              | tion that had specific impacts on recreation policy and
              | planning in Baltimore.

              | Industry’
              | By the early 1960s the postwar economic surge in the
              | U.S. had largely come to a halt, resulting in a growing
              | social inequality within many American cities, as real-
              | ized through economically-driven racial segregation and
              | the “white flight” of suburbanization (Harrington, 1962).
              | In this context, the inner city increasingly referred not
              | only to the core of the city, but also to the minority and
              | predominately black populations inhabiting urban spaces
              | challenged by the intensifying struggles of joblessness, de-
              | caying infrastructure, and criminality (Sugrue, 1996). As
              | Corburn suggests, the 1960s thus signaled the advent of
              | the ‘urban crisis’ within American politics, policy and plan-
              | ning, as cities were commonly viewed as the locus of so-
              | cial problems linked to economic inequality and racial and
              | ethnic divisions (2009, p. 54). Recreation spaces, facilities
              | and programs were also included in this policy and re-
              | search focus on urban America, as evidenced by the grow-
              | ing disparities in the amount and condition of facilities
              | and programming between different areas of the city and
              | suburbs. In this context, the “inner city” increasingly re-
              | ferred not only to the core of the city but also to the minor-
              | ity and predominately black populations of these areas—
              | and the struggles of joblessness, decaying infrastructure
              | and the stigmatization of the urban underclass were dis-
              | proportionately endured by these populations (Sugrue,
              | 1996). Further, recreation became an increasingly crucial
              | aspect in terms of serving as a progressive means of build-
              | ing community, and improving the quality of life in urban
              | neighborhoods, leading to an “era of growth” for public
              | recreation in Baltimore and other American cities in terms
              | of funding, programming, and facilities (Deppe, 1986).
              | However, this era was followed by larger shifts in
              | the politics and modes of governance of American cities,
              | and these shifts were to have particular and important
              | effects on the formation and implementation of urban
              | recreation policy, and within the operation of city recre-
              | ation departments. As Biles (2011, p. 202) explains, the
              | processes of federal and state “disinvestment” in urban
              | centers meant that by the late 1970s and into the 1980s,
              | many American cities and their citizens were essentially
              | left to “fend for themselves” in comparison to the peak
              | of social services funding and programming, especially
              | in regard to federal programs and policies. The changes
              | to these rationales resulted in Baltimore’s recreation sys-
              | tem being reconstructed with unprecedented financial
              | and political support, but also left this same system in
              | a state of nearly permanent struggle in regard to op-
              | erations, staffing and maintenance once this support
              | had waned. In short, the 1970s signaled the “high-water
              | mark”, or period of peak support and implementation,
              | and subsequent gradual decline of public recreation as
              | an essential social service for citizens of Baltimore and
              | other American cities.
              | Following Harvey (1989), the shifts within the gover-
              | nance of Baltimore during the 1970s evidence a larger
              | Social Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249
              | transformation in the methods and ideologies of Amer-
              | ican urban governance, specifically in the differing ap-
              | proaches towards operating and administrating city ser-
              | vices signaled by a shift from “urban managerialism” to
              | “urban entrepreneurialism”. Intertwined with the pro-
              | cesses of deindustrialization and suburbanization that
              | changed the city’ s population level, economic poten-
              | tial and demographic makeup, Harvey’s (1989) analysis
              | marks the transition away from the “managerial” Key-
              | nesian model of social service provision via public fund-
              | ing and support, and toward “entrepreneurial” strategies
              | centered on inter-urban competition for tourism and
              | consumption, often driven by attempts to re-imagine
              | specific areas of the city as hubs of capital growth and
              | economic redevelopment. In Baltimore, this reorienta-
              | tion of the aims and models of urban governance was
              | constituted primarily through the renewed emphases
              | on economic redevelopment projects, and the concur-
              | rent de-prioritization and reduction of public services,
              | including recreation. Thus, on the one hand, Baltimore
              | engaged in the processes of privatization and public-
              | private partnerships in order to complete tourist-focused
              | projects such as the Inner Harbor, professional baseball
              | (Camden Yards) and football (M& T Bank Stadium) stadia
              | projects, and Baltimore Convention Center, among oth-
              | ers, as part of a “renaissance” strategy that aimed to pro-
              | mote the city’s downtown area as a center of consump-
              | tion and entertainment (Harvey, 2001). On the other
              | hand, this focus on downtown development occurred si-
              | multaneously with the retrenchment of social services
              | and decline in population and housing for many of the
              | city’s neighborhoods. By the late 1990s, these processes
              | had constituted the formation of what Levine (2000)
              | recognized as the ‘three Baltimores’ of 1) the suburbs,
              | 2) downtown and the Inner Harbor, and 3) the multitude
              | of underserved neighborhoods, as the city and region
              | were increasingly characterized by both racial and class
              | inequalities and different realities in regards to economic
              | and social opportunity (p. 140).
              | Meanwhile as Deppe (1986) explains, in many Amer-
              | ican cities by the mid-1980s “recreation as an end to it-
              | self was totally unsalable” in regards to local, state, and
              | federal government policies (p. 34). In part, this was due
              | to the severe changes in demographics for many dein-
              | dustrializing cities like Baltimore, as urban populations
              | were increasingly characterized by economic and social
              | disparities. The impacts of suburbanization, especially
              | in regard to social stratification along racial and classed
              | lines, reshaped Baltimore as a post-industrial city that
              | was losing both economic opportunities and parts of its
              | population at the same time that federal and state gov-
              | ernments disassembled social service policies and pro-
              | grams (Durr, 2003; Levine, 2000). This meant that as
              | many American urban centers were increasingly charac-
              | terized by “a deteriorated economy, an inability to pro-
              | vide needed services, political indifference from state
              | and federal authorities, and a forecast of increasing con-
              | centration of local poverty,” recreation programs and
meta          | 243
text          | funding were increasingly less a priority, and more a per-
              | sistent thorn in the side of municipal governments faced
              | by other seemingly more pressing issues (Shivers, 1981,
              | p. 44). An efficiency-driven entrepreneurial approach to
              | public recreation would also develop within this era, as
              | the city worked to support existing and potential new
              | partnerships in relation to special facilities, while also at-
              | tempting to sustain a decreasing number of often inad-
              | equately staffed and poorly maintained neighborhood-
              | based facilities.
              | As primary aspects of the formation of public recre-
              | ation governance in this period, the partnership model
              | and necessity of a solution for the declining system of
              | neighborhood-based recreation facilities converged in
              | the form of an effort at restructuring the department,
              | and the general administration and provision of recre-
              | ation services in Baltimore. This resulted in the reinven-
              | tion and expansion of PAL recreation centers, which uti-
              | lized the neighborhood-based model of recreation fa-
              | cilities but were staffed and programmed by city po-
              | lice officers rather than public recreation personnel. The
              | PALs program had been operating in other cities, includ-
              | ing New York and Philadelphia, for several decades be-
              | fore being implemented in Baltimore, and while Balti-
              | more’s police had previously had limited youth-directed
              | programming, it wasn’t until 1995 that the PALs pro-
              | gram was officially developed and implemented in the
              | city, in part as the personal project of police Commis-
              | sioner Thomas Frazier ( “Police fill rec center void”, 1996).
              | Specifically, the PALs initiative was a response to the “link
              | between juvenile delinquency and inadequate youth pro-
              | grams” in many of Baltimore’s communities, especially
              | in the context of the “glaring inadequacy of city recre-
              | ation centers in some neighborhoods that need them
              | most” (“Police fill rec center void”, 1996). These devel-
              | opments reflect the impact of neoliberal urban gover-
              | nance on black communities in Baltimore, as many of
              | the neighborhoods in which the first 10 PAL centers had
              | been organized were already facing issues in regard to
              | recreation facility closures and decreases to staffing and
              | programming. The turn to the PAL program and facilities
              | therefore signals the formation of an alternative to recre-
              | ation services administered by and through a city recre-
              | ation department.
              | On the one hand, the partnership model was de-
              | ployed in regard to both an “inter-agency” partnership
              | between recreation facilities and police staff, as well as
              | in relation to the primary funding of the PAL centers
              | through non-profit grants and private donations (“Po-
              | lice fill rec center void”, 1996). On the other hand, the
              | PAL centers also directly incorporated the rationale of
              | volunteerism–specifically in the context of decreased
              | funding and support for neighborhood-based recreation
              | services and facilities–by supporting volunteer efforts at
              | the centers through community engagement. Thus, the
              | initial strategy was to implement a PAL center in each of
              | the city’s 29 police districts over the next several years,
              | each of which would be funded entirely by grants and
              | Social Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249
              | donations, and staffed by at least one full-time police offi-
              | cer at each center, “with other roles filled by volunteers”
              | (“Police fill rec center void”, 1996).
              | However, aside from serving as another example of
              | the processes of privatization and devolution, the PALs
              | initiative also signals another intersection of Baltimore’s
              | public recreation governance and broader political and
              | social restructuring of the period. The implementation
              | of the PAL centers points to the development of another
              | aspect of privatization in the shift from the support and
              | funding of recreation services through government re-
              | sources and programs, to the provision and administra-
              | tion of recreation primarily through private, non-profit
              | and volunteer-based facilities and services. That is, this
              | analysis recognizes that the PAL centers and strategy rep-
              | resent the re-emergence of the “prevention” rationale
              | for urban recreation services, as the PAL approach was
              | based on the re-prioritizing of recreation as an especially
              | efficient deterrent for juvenile delinquency and general
              | community disassociation in city neighborhoods. While
              | the prevention rationale had been central to the ap-
              | proach towards urban recreation that centered on recre-
              | ation as a particular ‘intervention’ for and within ur-
              | ban communities, the structure and organization of the
              | recreation-based interventions of public-private recre-
              | ation in the 1990s differed from previous models. As
              | Hartmann (2001, p. 340) notes, the re-emergence of
              | recreation as “prevention” and as “intervention” in the
              | 1990s was marked by two inter-related developments.
              | First, an increase in the scope, scale and number of
              | public-private partnerships within public recreation de-
              | partments and organizations; and second, the focus of
              | many of these partnerships on the perceived relation-
              | ships between neighborhood-based recreation programs
              | and community stability, safety, and social inclusion.
              | The partnership model was implemented in varying
              | degrees and towards different goals in relation to Bal-
              | timore’s recreation system throughout the 1980s and
              | 1990s, with the PALs program being an example of a
              | multi-partner “partnership” that incorporated the pro-
              | cess of privatization by effectively removing recreation
              | services from the city-operated and funded department
              | and transferring this service to an arrangement of public,
              | private and non-profit organizations. However, the PAL
              | centers also demonstrate the relationship between the
              | partnership model and the re-emergence of the preven-
              | tion and interventionist rationales as a primary justifica-
              | tion for the support and funding of neighborhood-based
              | recreation programs, as the program was organized with
              | the direct goal and purpose of reducing crime and ju-
              | venile delinquency, in particular in poorer communities.
              | Commissioner Frazier explained the PALs strategy was
              | appropriate for Baltimore as a city characterized by the
              | social polarization of “haves and have-nots”, and condi-
              | tions that were “a recipe for civil disorder,” as PAL cen-
              | ters were sites where the police could directly intervene
              | into the lives of children and adolescents and provide
              | an alternative to delinquent and criminal activities (as
meta          | 244
text          | quoted in Hermann, 1996). In Frazier’s view, the PAL sites
              | were in a better position to offer recreation services as
              | the program depended on private and non-profit fund-
              | ing rather than the city budget, and the centers served
              | as opportunities to build “social capital” with youth and
              | within communities, constituting the police as not only
              | law enforcement but as “part of the social fabric of the
              | city” (Hermann, 1996). The PALs program thus signals
              | a re-articulation of the prevention and interventionist
              | rationales for recreation services in this period, uncou-
              | pled from the previous formation and approach of urban
              | recreation based in government funding and support,
              | and instead linked specifically to the partnership model
              | of public-private recreation. Further, the PALs qualify as
              | one aspect of “social problems industry” (Pitter & An-
              | drews, 1997) that emerged within the context of Ameri-
              | can cities in the 1990s, often in response to the descaling
              | and decline of public social services.
              | In light of the decline of public recreation services
              | and facilities, many communities, families and individu-
              | als instead were faced with two alternatives in regards
              | to recreation provision: the private, fee-based model
              | that was not accessible or affordable for all city resi-
              | dents; or, the “new brand of social welfare” in the form
              | of neighborhood-based recreation through private and
              | non-profit organizations and programming that were of-
              | ten premised on the rationale of recreation as a method
              | of preventing social ills (Pitter & Andrews, 1997, p. 86).
              | However, and in contrast to the ‘universalist’ approach
              | included within the formation of urban recreation that
              | sought to implement recreation programming for all city
              | residents, the “social problems” organizations of the
              | 1990s also most often incorporated the rationales of
              | “prevention” and “intervention” into recreation program-
              | ming that was specifically organized towards children
              | and young adults, including the popular and controver-
              | sial “midnight basketball” programs that were developed
              | in many American cities during this period (Hartmann,
              | 2001, p. 99). The PAL centers also were organized around
              | these ideas, as each center included a “midnight” or
              | evening basketball league for young adult males as part
              | of its programming, which was most often limited to chil-
              | dren and adolescents during the afternoon and evening
              | operating hours (Matthews, 1997a). As Hartmann (2001)
              | notes, these programs may allow for forms of social inclu-
              | sion to develop between participants; however, and as
              | we emphasize in the following section, the PALs program
              | in Baltimore can be primarily recognized as a specific
              | form of urban neoliberalization. Following Kelly (2011),
              | neoliberal interventions involving sport and physical ac-
              | tivity often emphasize individual social behaviors and
              | “deficits”, and serve to discount structural inequalities in-
              | cluding the reduction of public services (p. 145).
              | 3. Neoliberalization and the PALs in Baltimore
              | Following Peck and Tickell (2002), neoliberal policy
              | changes and initiatives are often interconnected to the
              | Social Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249
              | rolling-back of public services within urban spaces, and
              | yet are differentiated by particular rationales and logics.
              | Roll-back neoliberalization signaled the wider transfor-
              | mation of American urban governance in regard to the
              | erosion and dismantling of the Keynesian approach of
              | an earlier generation. Roll-out neoliberalization emerged
              | from this ideological shift, in the form of localized poli-
              | cies and initiatives that sought to construct an alterna-
              | tive form of social service delivery and provision, simul-
              | taneously addressing the “recurrent failures…of deregu-
              | lation and marketization” (Peck & Tickell, 2002, p. 43)
              | strategies that unerringly arose. Thus, as Brenner and
              | Theodore (2002) illustrate, roll-out neoliberalization de-
              | veloped in relation to the “immanent contradictions and
              | crisis tendencies” of neoliberal policy itself, as cities in-
              | voked other neoliberal strategies in an attempt to en-
              | gage with the realities of disinvestment and privatization
              | (p. 34). The transformation of urban policy within roll-
              | back neoliberalization effectively created the break for
              | alternate approaches to urban governance, often in the
              | form of other neoliberal policy strategies that were en-
              | acted, or “rolled-out”, in order to address the shortcom-
              | ings and tensions of the rolling-back and dismantling of
              | a previous form of governance.
              | The incorporation and implementation of the PALs
              | program in Baltimore signals one aspect of the refig-
              | ured approach to recreation; established rationales for
              | recreation re-emerged, but were most often incorpo-
              | rated into the neoliberal processes of privatization, de-
              | volution and volunteerism, rather than as a premise
              | for funding and supporting a city-operated public recre-
              | ation agency. The PALs initiative represents a key ele-
              | ment and force in the restructuring of recreation cen-
              | ter policy within roll-out neoliberalization, as the de-
              | partment sought to supplement community and non-
              | profit partnerships with a different type of recreation ser-
              | vice, aimed at the youth population in particular “prob-
              | lem” neighborhoods. Within the PAL program, city po-
              | lice officers were assigned to “active participation…as
              | role models, mentors, and caring adults for young peo-
              | ple,” and tasked with developing programming specifi-
              | cally designed for ages 7 through 17 that offered “a com-
              | bined focus on character development, academic enrich-
              | ment, arts and cultural activities, and athletics” (Subhas
              | & Chandra, 2004). Operating under the program’s motto,
              | “Giving kids in our toughest neighborhoods a chance to
              | succeed”, the PAL program sought to display “how law en-
              | forcement personnel can have an impact on youth by fos-
              | tering academic excellence, civic responsibility, creativ-
              | ity, self-regulation, and social values” (Subhas & Chan-
              | dra, 2004). The initial implementation of the program
              | had immediate effects on the city’s recreation system, as
              | several of the first 10 PAL centers were recreation cen-
              | ters that had been closed or were threatened with im-
              | minent closure due to budget cuts (“Police fill rec center
              | void”, 1996).
              | The PALs program, like other private and non-profit
              | recreation programs focused on neighborhood-based
meta          | 245
text          | crime prevention outcomes, had several advantages
              | over public recreation departments, primarily in regard
              | to the differences in funding and support. While PAL
              | centers attracted tax-exempt donations and grants from
              | local and regional non-profit foundations, the city pub-
              | lic recreation department was reliant on continually de-
              | creasing budgets and grant-funding opportunities. In July
              | 1996, this “special advantage” meant that while the de-
              | partment was facing an additional $2 million budget
              | shortfall, and the possibility of further facility closures
              | and staff layoffs, the PALs program expanded to 11 sites
              | that were all former city recreation centers, and was re-
              | ceiving over $200,000 annually in donations and grant
              | funding for equipment and other facilities. This included
              | a former 7-Eleven on in northeast Baltimore that was of-
              | fered to the city for $1 by the non-profit MACHT founda-
              | tion, with the understanding that it would developed as
              | a PAL site (Hermann, 1996).
              | The growth and support of the PALs program, while
              | an example of the shifts to private and non-profit “part-
              | ners” in the place of public recreation provision, also
              | meant that the department was positioned as being in-
              | efficiently administered. Later that year–and in addition
              | to forewarning further budget cuts—Mayor Schmoke as-
              | sembled a 12-person “task force” to examine how the
              | department could address these inefficiencies, by imple-
              | menting increased user fees, the sale of parkland, and
              | conversion of vacant land towards generating revenue
              | that could help the department “pay more of its own
              | way” (Matthews, 1996). While the “task force” model
              | of recreation planning and policy would emerge again
              | in Baltimore nearly fifteen years later, Schmoke’s utiliza-
              | tion of this model signaled the necessity of alternative
              | solutions to public recreation governance within the un-
              | folding neoliberal climate. As the department’s attempts
              | to maintain a “universalist” mission and vision of public
              | recreation faltered (largely due to the reduction in the
              | levels of resources and funding that had made the mis-
              | sion possible), the corollary was a visibly broken recre-
              | ation system. As Schmoke indicated in announcing his
              | task force, if the current trends of “downsizing” and “con-
              | solidation of services” continued, the department would
              | also continue to “dwindle to a level that is unaccept-
              | able” (Matthews, 1996). Thus, along with being viewed
              | as a more viable alternative and better-equipped com-
              | petitor to the department’s recreation centers, PAL sites
              | were often used to explain the inefficiencies of the de-
              | partment and its inability to effectively restructure recre-
              | ation provision.
              | The deprioritization of public recreation as a city
              | agency and service provider throughout the 1980s and
              | 1990s symbolized the “slow death” of public recreation
              | in the city, especially in comparison to the earlier gen-
              | eration of federally-subsidized support for recreation ini-
              | tiatives. Budget cuts and subsequent reductions to facili-
              | ties, staff and programs meant that by 2000, Baltimore’s
              | recreation centers had decreased from over 130 to less
              | than 70, over 80 of the city’s playgrounds were consid-
              | Social Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249
              | ered unsafe, and one maintenance worker was responsi-
              | ble for over 100 acres of city parks (Farrey, 2008, p. 232).
              | However, these changes also normalized neoliberalizing
              | strategies that proved impactful beyond the public recre-
              | ation realm. First, the highly visible inter-agency transfer
              | of recreation services from the city’s public recreation de-
              | partment to the PAL administration and budget encour-
              | aged the further devolution of public services in favor of
              | market alternatives (Tennberg, Vola, Espiritu, Schwenke
              | Fors, & Ejdemo, 2014). Second, modeled after a simi-
              | lar initiative in several other cities including New York
              | and Philadelphia, the PALs also serve as a form of what
              | Peck and Tickell (2002, p. 391) refer to as “interjurisdic-
              | tional policy transfer”, in which city governments share
              | and incorporate particular elements of neoliberal pol-
              | icy restructuring across different locations. In this mode,
              | the PAL program popularized the social problems indus-
              | try ethos, in which recreational opportunities were di-
              | rectly correlated with patterns of juvenile delinquency
              | and viewed as a tool that could address the effects and
              | consequences of social inequality. In seeking to adopt
              | some of the same principles in forming the PAL program
              | in Baltimore, Police Commissioner Frazier asserted that
              | the program sought to build “social capital” between of-
              | ficers and neighborhood youth, especially in the context
              | of the city’s socioeconomic environment of “haves and
              | have-nots” (Hermann, 1996). As a form of intervention-
              | ist policy that was effectively shared by multiple Amer-
              | ican cities, the PAL program therefore evidences a lack
              | of concern for local conditions, and instead emphasizes
              | a universal understanding of sport as a cure for a vari-
              | ety of social problems, rather than a focus on the par-
              | ticular forces that “might lead to desired outcomes for
              | some participants or some organizations in certain cir-
              | cumstances” (Coalter, 2010, p. 311).
              | In August 1997, the contrasting realities of the city’s
              | recreation centers and PAL centers—with recreation fa-
              | cilities facing annual budget reductions, and the possi-
              | bility of partial or full closures, while PAL centers contin-
              | ued to see increased private and non-profit funding and
              | political support—were evidenced in Mayor Schmoke’s
              | plan to expand the PAL program to another 10 centers,
              | all of which were operating as city recreation facilities at
              | the time of the plan’s announcement (Matthews, 1997b).
              | The decision to simultaneously and directly increase the
              | number of PALs, while reducing recreation centers, pro-
              | voked tensions regarding the roles and purposes of each
              | of the agencies involved, including criticism regarding
              | the role of staff and a lack of recreation training by po-
              | lice officers charged with operating the PAL centers. How-
              | ever, while a community volunteer at the Robert C. Mar-
              | shall center in west Baltimore (one of the centers desig-
              | nated for transfer to the PAL program) would describe
              | the plan as “one of the worst mistakes they can possibly
              | make”, the overriding rationale for the transfer of the 10
              | facilities was provided by the Mayor who stated it would
              | allow the city to “likely get through the year without clos-
              | ing any recreation centers” (Matthews, 1997b). The final
meta          | 246
text          | plan would involve not only the immediate transfer of
              | the 10 centers, but also the establishing of at least one
              | PAL center in each of the city’s 29 police districts, as the
              | PAL program was again framed as a potential solution to
              | both the issues of a declining public recreation system
              | and the “problems based” context of many urban com-
              | munities (Subhas & Chandra, 2004). As a form of rolled-
              | out recreation, the devolution of services and facilities
              | from the city’s recreation department to the PALs pro-
              | gram serves as an example of a policy initiative designed
              | and deployed specifically towards addressing the condi-
              | tions of rolled-back urban neoliberalization.
              | Despite public support for the PALs in the interven-
              | ing years that saw the number of centers expanded to 27
              | locations by 2000, the program had long faced financial
              | struggles, and Mayor Martin O’Malley was subsequently
              | forced to close several centers in his first two years in of-
              | fice (Craig, 2000). Then in 2003, after the non-profit or-
              | ganization that operated the PAL centers announced that
              | they were no longer financially capable of managing the
              | program, O’Malley transferred control of the remaining
              | 18 PALs to the police department (Wilber, 2003). There-
              | after, the program endured several years of financial
              | shortfalls. The citywide budget cuts in 2009 ultimately
              | made the operation of the PAL centers unfeasible for a
              | police department facing its own fiscal challenges. The
              | demise of the PAL program also had immediate conse-
              | quences for city recreation centers, as the transfer of fa-
              | cilities from the recreation department to the PALs pro-
              | gram that had occurred in the mid and late 1990s was
              | essentially reversed (Hermann, 2009). Further, in order
              | to meet budget expectations, the department planned
              | to close two recreation centers of its own, lay off several
              | staff positions, and reduce hours at several centers to “af-
              | ter school only”—the negative public reaction to these
              | planned closures and reductions in services was evident
              | in the dozens of letters and emails that the department
              | received, mostly in protest of the transfers and closures
              | of PAL centers (Hermann, 2009).
              | In response, the final implementation of the strat-
              | egy to address the future of neighborhood recreation
              | centers saw 12 of the PALs re-incorporated into the
              | system of city recreation centers, with a single center
              | closing and the others transferred to schools or non-
              | profit groups already operating in the facility (Hermann,
              | 2009). However, the transfer of these facilities to the
              | control of the recreation department was not accompa-
              | nied by an increase to the operating budget of the de-
              | partment, meaning that recreation center staff and ser-
              | vices were tasked with an increased number of facili-
              | ties, on a still-shrinking budget. In many ways, the re-
              | addition of the former PAL sites to the network of recre-
              | ation centers represented a window into the city’s fis-
              | cal and administrative crisis: the reabsorption of facilities
              | and services into a system defined by years of declining
              | budgets and support only served to aggravate existing
              | problems in relation to recreation staffing, programming,
              | and maintenance.

              | 4. Conclusions
              | An analysis of the PALs in Baltimore is also relevant to
              | wider discussions regarding the uneven development of
              | post-industrial cities, as well as the linkages between ur-
              | ban recreation and the goals and practices of social inclu-
              | sion (Collins, 2014). However, and as this article demon-
              | strates, the shifting relations between public recreation,
              | urban policy and planning, and issues of social inclusion
              | within Baltimore have special importance in the local
              | context; they have often emerged in the wake of tragic
              | events, including the violence following the assassina-
              | tion of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the death of
              | Baltimore resident Freddie Gray while in police custody
              | in 2015 (Efelbein, Nix & Hollowak, 2011; Reutter, 2015).
              | Within this context, the deprioritization of pub-
              | lic recreation—and, within the Baltimore context, the
              | demise of the PALs and continued disinvestment in
              | public recreation—were inevitabilities. The provision of
              | recreation for Baltimore’s continually underserved urban
              | populations markedly declined in the period post-2009,
              | a situation brought to the public’s attention in the after-
              | math of the 2015 violence in Baltimore ignited by the
              | unlawful killing of Freddie Gray, wherein some of the
              | city’s youth took to the streets in protest. While perhaps
              | not easily attributable to the demise of public recreation
              | within the city, many local politicians asserted this posi-
              | tion. For instance, city councilman Bill Henry condemned
              | the decades-long underfunding of public services aimed
              | at improving the lives of young black citizens, including
              | after-school programs, libraries, and recreation centers
              | (Reutter, 2015). In Henry’s words, the city’s youth no
              | longer attend recreation centers in the numbers they did
              | previously because “They are in awful shape because we
              | haven’t put any money in them in any serious amounts
              | for a quarter of a century” (quoted in Reutter, 2015).
              | Tellingly, Henry continued—underscoring the shift to-
              | ward carceral initiatives indicative of urban governance
              | within the state of exception of neoliberal austerity—
              | “the city has ‘purposely disinvested’ in young people ‘in
              | favor of investing in catching and caging them’” (quoted
              | in Reutter, 2015).
              | Many scholars have recognized the impact of urban
              | neoliberalization on communities of color, specifically in
              | relation to social inequality and economic opportunity
              | (Wacquant, 2009), as well as in regard to the connec-
              | tions between reduced social support and increased lev-
              | els of mass incarceration (Alexander, 2012). In his recent,
              | and vivid, contextualization of the Midnight Basketball
              | League, Hartmann (2016, p. 73) refers to this expression
              | of the social problems industry as an “example of neolib-
              | eral paternalism and the new carceral state, a microcosm
              | of American neoliberal social policy and racialized politi-
              | cal culture.” As we have demonstrated within this brief
              | discussion, Baltimore’s PALs can be considered in pre-
              | cisely the same vein. They emerged and developed out
              | of the conflation of paternalistic and punitive attitudes
              | toward Baltimore’s underserved urban populace, which
meta          | 247
text          | effectively demonized the very population they were at-
              | tempting to serve. Despite the unqestionably laudable
              | intentions of many of those working within the PAL pro-
              | gram, its very institutional structure and philosophy po-
              | sitioned the urban populace (rather than the broader
              | forces and relations responsible for challenging urban
              | conditions) as an a priori problem that needed to be ad-
              | dressed. In Baltimore and other American cities, issues
              | related to the social (dis)investement in young people of
              | color have been the primary concern of emergent polit-
              | ical and social movements, including Black Lives Matter,
              | and the incorporation of these issues into the activism of
              | community organizations holds some promise for a re-
              | structured approach to interventionist policies and pro-
              | grams. However, and as we have demonstrated, within
              | the context of the urban neoliberalization of the late
              | 1990s and early 2000s, the Baltimore PAL program was
              | often rooted in assumptions regarding the role of recre-
              | ation in the process of improving the social inclusion of
              | spatially, social, and economically marginalized groups.
              | This analysis therefore suggests that the very real lim-
              | its of recreation policy need to be taken into account
              | when designing and implementing future interventions,
              | lest we fail to learn from the experiences–and thereby
              | repeat the mistakes–of the not too distant past.
