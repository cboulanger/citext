              | Labor and Global Justice: Emerging Reform Coalitions in the
              | World’s Only Superpower**
              | This paper examines rejuvenated labor, environmental and campus movements in the U.S.,
              | in case studies of living wage, anti-sweatshop, sustainable development and Justice for Jani-
              | tors campaigns. The cases offer surprising evidence for the resurgence of progressive activ-
              | ism in America, at a critical historical juncture in which contrasting perspectives contend for
              | prominence – Washington consensus versus Seattle coalition, employer-driven de-
              | unionization versus union-led mobilization, corporate power and corruption versus labor-
              | inclusive social movement upsurge, and in the global arena, unilateral domination versus
              | multilateral negotiation. Predominantly local, the coalitions examined in this research, taken
              | together across the United States, amount to a substantial movement for broad economic
              | and social policy reform, an American movement with potentially global ramifications. The
              | argument presented here contends that this revitalization of social forces in the U.S. is sig-
              | nificant enough to need explanation, and presents evidence pointing toward key causal
              | forces at work: chronic inequality, strategic leadership, and coalition building.
              | Arbeiterbewegung und globale Gerechtigkeit.
              | Neue Reformkoalitionen in der einzigen Supermacht der Welt
              | Thema dieses Beitrags sind neu erstarkte Arbeiter-, Umwelt- und Studentenbewegungen in den
              | USA, die in Fallstudien über deren Kampagnen (Lebensstandard, Anti-Sweatshop, nachhaltige
              | Entwicklung und Justice for Janitors) untersucht werden. Die Fallbeispiele dokumentieren überra-
              | schende Evidenzen für die Wiederbelebung eines progressiven Aktivismus in Amerika an einer
              | kritischen Wegscheide mit konstrastierenden Perspektiven – Washington-Konsensus versus
              | Seattle-Koalition, kapitalgesteuerte Antigewerkschaftskampagnen versus gewerkschaftliche
              | Mobilisierung, unternehmerische Macht und Korruption versus Arbeiter- und soziale Bewe-
              | gung, und in der globalen Arena: unilaterale Dominanz versus multilaterale Aushandlung.
              | Wenn die in diesem Beitrag beschriebenen Koalitionen auch vorwiegend lokalen Charakter
              | haben, stellen sie doch, zählt man sie zusammen, eine substanzielle Bewegung für breite öko-
              | nomische und soziapolitische Reformen dar, eine amerikanische Bewegung mit globalen Ver-
              | zweigungen. Vertreten wird das Argument, dass die Revitalisierung der sozialen Kräfte in den
              | USA bedeutsam genug ist, um nach einer Erklärung zu verlangen, und dass die Evidenzen auf
              | die Kausalität zentraler Kräfte verweisen: auf chronische Ungleichheit, strategische Führer-
              | schaft und Koalitionsbildung.
              | Key words: Unions, labor revitalization, coalition building, comparative

text          | Since the Reagan/Thatcher era, there has been an air of inevitability about the growth
              | of corporate power, the decline of labor unions, and the expansion of global capital-
              | ism. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union deepened
              | the sense of irreversible market triumph. The only remaining superpower has led the
              | charge toward an increasingly deregulated, “unleashed” global economy.
              | Yet both organized and theoretical opposition to the dominant global vision are
              | growing. In recent years an alternative vision has begun to take shape and to gain in
              | political viability. The “Battle of Seattle” in late 1999 and subsequent mass demonstra-
              | tions through 2002 in Prague, Quebec, Genoa, Porto Alegre and Barcelona, followed
              | by massive world-wide antiwar demonstrations on February 15, 2003, have given
              | voice to the opposition. Insiders such as Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph
              | Stiglitz (2002), former chief economist at the World Bank, have deepened their criti-
              | cism of the IMF model and Washington consensus. A corporate corruption epidemic
              | in 2002 undermined the legitimacy of unregulated markets and corporate power.
              | The focus of this study1 is on the labor proponents of an emerging alternate vi-
              | sion. The focus, in other words, is on the actors rather than what they are fighting for,
              | since the reform vision is only beginning to take shape and will mean nothing without
              | the actors (such as unions) who promote, negotiate, revise, campaign for and imple-
              | ment the new ideas and policies.
              | If the dominant vision can be called market globalism, the emerging alternative
              | points toward a more democratic globalism. After a broad overview to highlight core de-
              | bates, this paper focuses on key U.S. unions and their coalitions, opposing the domi-
              | nance of currently configured global capitalism – for the most part in battles at the lo-
              | cal level – while gradually developing an alternative view. In the U.S., the relevant so-
              | cial actors include most prominently revitalized labor, environmental, student and an-
              | tiwar movements, in coalition with each other and a variety of other community, reli-
              | gious, civil rights and political groups.
              | This coalition-based research assumes that global reform conflicts will take shape
              | not as North-South, rich-poor, business-labor or even Empire-multitudes (Hardt and
              | Negri 2000), but rather in wide-ranging, shifting coalitions of a multiplicity of actors –
              | including national governments and international agencies as well as domestic and in-
              | ternational labor, business and other NGO’s. The focus here on labor as a social force
              | inside the United States also assumes that reformist movements inside the one re-
              | maining superpower are essential for the prospects of expanded global democracy.2

              | This is not meant to devalue the role of domestic and international labor coalitions else-
              | where throughout the global North and South. Many unions in the U.S., in fact, are in-
              | creasingly aware of the urgent need for cross-national and global coalitions (Gordon and
              | Turner 2000; Nissen 2002). But the primary focus here is on labor-led domestic coalition
              | building in the U.S., in the context of an increasingly global economy.

text          | Lowell Turner: Labor and Global Justice
              | Explaining growing opposition
              | Greatly simplified, the central conflict within the global North finds multinational
              | corporations and the U.S. government (and some of its allies) on one side, promoting
              | market globalism, backed by and working with existing national and global institu-
              | tions, with groupings of organized interests, social movements and other NGO’s on
              | the other side, beginning to mobilize for reform. The argument examined in this paper
              | explains the growing significance of reform forces with reference to three variables: vast domes-
              | tic and global inequality (highlighted by recent corporate scandals); new leadership with a
              | broadened strategic vision at key activist groups, including the AFL-CIO and several of its
              | leading unions; and a growing, contagious focus among activist groups on coalition
              | building.
              | While these variables may best explain the current upsurge of opposition to mar-
              | ket (or corporate) globalism, they are together not enough to produce substantial de-
              | mocratic reform in the global economy. Also required for successful reform, evidence
              | considered here suggests, are both an expanded capacity for grassroots mobilization (rely-
              | ing on the “people power” that affords comparative advantage to these reform
              | groups) and a new political opportunity structure. The latter depends upon divisions among
              | established powers, including multinational corporations and rich country govern-
              | ments. Corporate scandals that disinherit employees and investors, the European push
              | toward a “social Europe,” trade conflicts among governments, intense differences
              | over war in Iraq, and conflicts between governments and WTO, IMF, World Bank
              | and other international agencies all offer potential openings in the political opportu-
              | nity structure.
              | Economic circumstances (such as inequality) and political opportunity structures
              | (including corporate scandals) are thus significant in shaping the prospects for a viable
              | opposition to the dominant market globalism. The focus of this research is nonethe-
              | less on strategic actors and their coalitions for reform. Unlike much social science
              | analysis that emphasizes constraints, barriers and (often insurmountable) problems,
              | the actor-based theoretical approach offered here emphasizes possibilities and poten-
              | tial breakthroughs. While we certainly need to understand the depths of the challenges
              | facing democratic reform efforts in the contemporary global economy – and research
              | that explores the challenges and barriers is indispensable – revitalization research is
              | also essential in pointing toward opportunities for reform.
              | After the presentation of core concepts and case study research, a brief reconsid-
              | eration of the literature highlights the potential contributions of an actor-based revi-
              | talization approach that focuses less on problem constellations than on efforts aimed
              | at overcoming the problems.
              | Contending visions of a global economy
              | In the wake of the cold war, as we build – or fail to build – a new world order, two
              | core debates have emerged. The first is between those who favor and those who op-
              | pose the development of a global economy and society. Thomas Friedman has called

text          | this the debate over whether to globalize.3 In the chart below, the forces listed under
              | Fighting the Global Economy, alone or in various combinations, seek to counter and op-
              | pose the modern push toward globalization. In so doing, these forces campaign pri-
              | marily against the existing dominant market globalism, yet they also undermine the
              | potential foundations of democratic globalism.
              | The second core debate is between what is here called market and democratic
              | globalism. Friedman refers to a debate over how to globalize. In various ways, the con-
              | stituents of these two contending camps promote a global economy and to some ex-
              | tent a global society as well. Against the nationalists, localists and fundamentalists of

text          | Lowell Turner: Labor and Global Justice
              | Market globalism
              | Market globalism is the dominant force shaping today’s world economy.4 The emphasis
              | is on free markets. Multinational corporations, backed by the rich country govern-
              | ments in which they are based, are the primary economic and political actors shaping
              | this global order. We used to say “what’s good for GM is good for America” (or at
              | least that was what the widely quoted president of GM said). Now it’s more like
              | “what’s good for capital is good for the global economy”: trickle-down economics
              | writ large. The World Trade Organization and the G-7 heads of states actively and
              | centrally promote the interests of business – in the belief that what is good for inter-
              | national business is good for us all.
              | In the context of existing global institutions and architecture, this model aims to
              | maximize opportunities for business by expanding free trade, deregulation, and capital
              | flows while minimizing business risk. Property rights and investment protections in
              | trade agreements are important, but not labor or environmental standards that raise
              | costs and cut down on business discretion (and thus investment, jobs and general
              | prosperity in this trickle-down worldview). While the primary locus of economic and
              | political power lies in the global North, the governments and large businesses of many
              | developing countries are also party to the dominant global order. From “crony capital-
              | ism” to labor-repressive domestic policies and acceptance of the IMF model, many
              | (but not all) governments of the South help sustain market globalism while blocking
              | democratic reform both at home and in the global economy.
              | Contemporary negotiations at the G-7, WTO, IMF and World Bank aim to
              | deepen market globalism as an engine of prosperity and development. Markets are
              | powerful instruments that can and often do promote an efficient allocation of re-
              | sources and economic growth. But free markets typically also produce great inequali-
              | ties and environmental “externalities.” Growing social and economic polarization in
              | the United States is one example; by contrast, inequality is tempered in Europe by
              | stronger social policy (Hutton 2002). Most serious is the growing divide between rich
              | and poor countries, referred to by Bruce Scott (2001) as “the great divide in the global
              | village.” A widespread concern here is that even if we don’t care about the injustice of
              | inequality, we will quite simply never be safe from terrorists, revolutionaries and other
              | anti-system forces in a vastly unequal world (see also Kapstein 1996).
              | Democratic globalism
              | In response to such concerns, democratic globalism has emerged in recent years as a pow-
              | erful yet still largely unformed alternative vision and force.5 Most participants at the
              | Seattle demonstrations would I believe fall under this heading. American labor unions,
              | for example, have in many (but not all) cases moved beyond national protectionism to

              | and many more have mobilized in new coalitions, local, national and global, to ad-

              | Among such a wide variety of international, national and local groupings, there
              | are to be sure substantially diverging interests. Some World Social Forum leaders are
              | in fact more anti-globalist than reformist. Policy proposals in areas such as immigra-
              | tion and debt relief are highly contested within reform circles. Conflicts among envi-
              | ronmental and poverty activists are commonplace and chronic. Overcoming such

              | local level on up (Rose 2000).
              | While such groups and coalitions are still emerging, still working out points of
              | unity and disagreement, there is a common thread: a growing call for voice, for de-
              | mocratic input, for the concerns of workers, citizens and the environment to be heard
              | in economic and political decision-making processes. The press typically labels the
              | protestors “anti-globalization.” Some of them are, including many of the most visible
              | and violent (the ones the press itself loves to glorify). Understanding that we live in an
              | increasingly global society, however, most of these activist groups aim to expand de-
              | mocratic voice at all the levels where it is now essential: local, national, regional and
              | global. The democratic globalist vision, in its developing essence, aims to preserve and
              | expand democratic voice where it now exists at national and local levels, and to build a
              | new global social dimension so that globalization does not overwhelm local and na-
              | tional democracy.
              | Democratic globalism is not for the most part a revolutionary force. On the con-
              | trary, it is overwhelmingly reformist, seeking to reform existing market globalism to
              | make it more democratic, more just and green. Just as the brutalities of early capital-
              | ism called forth both reformist and revolutionary opposition, so the brutalities of
              | global capitalism call forth many types of opposition. In the rich countries at least, and
              | to a large extent in developing countries as well, the dominant call of the opposition is
              | not for overthrow of the system but for inclusion. This could change if inclusion is
              | denied, as the powers-that-be are often warned – from the outside by vast demonstra-
              | tions and from the inside by analysts such as Ethan Kapstein (1996), George Soros
              | (2002) and Joseph Stiglitz (2002). A new focus at Nike and other companies on “cor-
              | porate social responsibility” and codes of conduct as well as the World Bank’s new
              | sensitivity to political realities in developing countries can all be understood as re-
              | sponses to (and attempts to co-opt) mounting pressures for reform.6

              | Exclusion combined with deprivation can transform reformist into revolutionary
              | forces, creating a fertile seedbed for extraordinary evils such as ethnic cleansing and
              | terrorism. In short, the alternatives to a reformist democratic globalism are not pretty.
              | Forces of reaction
              | Forces opposing the global economy vary across a wide range of strategies and world-
              | views. What they have in common, in addition to an opposition to globalization, is a
              | tendency to look backward in time. Earlier romantics looked to a state of nature or an
              | idyllic medieval village – one that may never have existed but has been nicely recreated
              | for mass consumption at today’s Renaissance Faire. Anti-globalizers look back to the
              | glory and security of the nation-state, the vitality of the local community, the sanctity
              | of religious purity or the certainty of past ideologies. While the visions may be com-
              | pelling and may even attract mass followings, each is in fundamental ways impossibly
              | discordant with the modern world.
              | Nationalism puts the interests of the nation-state above all else. Historically, this
              | force is associated with the nation-building of the 19th and 20th centuries and has
              | brought many gains, from national defense and prosperity to the welfare state. On the
              | downside, nationalism produces intolerance, narrow-mindedness and war. In the
              | global economy, nationalist sentiment can choke off world trade and global solutions
              | to common problems. A contemporary example of shortsighted nationalism lies in the
              | American decision in 2001 to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, a far-reaching in-
              | ternational agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions and global warming, on the
              | grounds that this might hurt the American economy.
              | Localism offers a beautiful alternative vision based on the vitality, environment
              | and interpersonal connections of local place and community (Mander and Goldsmith
              | 1996). Again, however, the task is to integrate communities, along with regional and
              | national economies, in a constructive way within the broader world economy. Local-
              | ism that takes the form of anti-government anarchism is a utopian dead-end – or
              | worse when it takes shape as window-smashing black shirts at otherwise non-violent
              | mass demonstrations.
              | If Hitler and the Holocaust were products of a vile, extreme nationalism, the ter-
              | rorist attacks of September 11 were products of an extreme and intolerant religious fun-
              | damentalism. While most religious fundamentalists are non-violent and many withdraw
              | to a large extent from the modern world, uncompromising religious belief can moti-
              | vate all kinds of horrors. Historically, wars and massacres in the name of religion have
              | been particularly bloody, and in our time the targets have ranged from doctors per-
              | forming abortions to ethnic cleansing in the Balkans to the attack on innocent civil-
              | ians at the World Trade Center. Religious fundamentalists look backward in time to
              | early religious communities and saviors and forward in time to some promised land
              | beyond the earth. Squeezed between these idealized points of reference, an increas-
              | ingly global society, especially a commercial, secular one, appears alien and often
              | threatening to core fundamentalist values.
              | Communism offered an alternative global vision, one that failed long before the
              | collapse of the Soviet Union. Today’s communists, in places such as China and Cuba
              | (along with significant reformed communist – now largely social-democratic – unions

meta          | 99
text          | and parties throughout eastern and western Europe), hardly offer much threat to the
              | new global order. China, the one large bastion where a communist government rules,
              | has largely abandoned any kind of Marxist economic vision in favor of the dynamism
              | of markets – with great economic success – and has now joined the WTO.
              | Neo-naziism is an extreme one-dimensional form of nationalism, based on racial or
              | ethnic superiority. This is also largely a failed vision of the past, with ugly present ech-
              | oes in “skinhead” attacks on foreign workers in Germany, in anti-immigrant propa-
              | ganda in France and many other societies, and in outrages like the Oklahoma City fed-
              | eral building bombing. With little mass following anywhere, thoroughly discredited in
              | the wake of World War II, such ideologies have only minimal bearing on global de-
              | bates yet continue to persist as dangerous, backward looking fringe forces in modern
              | societies.
              | None of the five forces fighting the global economy offer realistic solutions to
              | contemporary problems. All look backward in time rather than forward. While com-
              | munism and neo-naziism offer only failed and seriously flawed visions of the past, na-
              | tionalism and localism each offer one important building block as long as neither is
              | reified into the sole solution. Where religious fundamentalism is non-violent, it offers
              | a test of the capacity of modern secular societies for wide-ranging religious tolerance
              | and freedom. A broadly acceptable global vision will surely exclude neo-naziism and
              | terrorism while accepting reformed communism and religious freedom and building
              | upon local vitality and the still important nation-state.
              | Forces for reform: Labor, environmental and campus activism
              | At the dawning of a new millennium, perhaps anything is possible. How many of us
              | dreamed in our darkest nights of passenger planes exploding into mammoth high-rise
              | buildings? The unspeakable proved all too possible.
              | Yet there were also signs of wonder and hope at the turning of the millennium.
              | On November 30, 1999, sea turtles rose up on two legs and marched through the
              | streets of Seattle. They challenged the World Trade Organization and joined with
              | workers and students to protest corporate dominance of the global economy. To-
              | gether they planted seeds of democratic globalism. The emerging vision persists, now
              | offering a way beyond the horrors of September 11 and the injustice of growing ine-
              | quality and massive corporate corruption.
              | What American actors can promote and advocate the deepening of democracy at
              | local, national and global levels? As always in such periods, multiple movements are
              | present, feeding off each other, overlapping, in conflict and in coalition. As unions
              | move toward new tactics of rank-and-file mobilization and broad coalition building,
              | the labor movement is a central presence in the current upsurge, and indeed the core is-
              | sue is economic and social polarization – in both American and global society. The en-
              | vironmental movement, building on three decades of progress, swells in fits and starts as
              | the earth’s limits become increasingly clear and as former opponents such as unions
              | come around. “Blue-green” (labor-environmental) alliances spread, from college cam-
              | puses where green and sweatshop activists intermingle to local coalitions for sustain-
              | able jobs and national campaigns against fast track and the Free Trade Area of the
              | Americas. After decades of quiescence, campus activism is on the rise, around labor, en-

              | vironmental and a variety of other issues. In addition, human rights, civil rights, the
              | women’s movement, consumer protection, international solidarity, the peace and debt
              | relief movements, community organizing around local issues – all play a role in today’s
              | resurgent progressive coalitions. And building on all of these is the more recent and
              | potentially massive antiwar movement (led by groups such as MoveOn.org, ANSWER,
              | ATTAC, and USLAW – U.S. Labor against the War).
              | There is also a blending of generations in these campaigns for reform and ex-
              | panded democracy. Many of today’s labor, environmental and antiwar leaders are
              | themselves former activists of the sixties. Idealistic, informed by lifelong social values,
              | they are now highly skilled organizers and competent administrators as well. Yet the
              | driving energy comes from a new generation, in their late teens and twenties, campus,
              | community and workplace activists, coming of age in a churning social environment
              | that kindles activist passion. From Students Against Sweatshops to “union kids” on
              | the front lines of organizing drives, from green-haired sea turtles in Seattle to high-
              | school demonstrators against war in Iraq, the next generation of activists has arrived.
              | When social movements subside (as they always do), they leave behind networks
              | and communities of activists who defend the gains and carry on the campaigns, espe-
              | cially at the grassroots level. This is a phenomenon well known to social movement
              | theorists, and this is exactly what happened in the 1970s and 1980s (Staggenborg
              | 1998; Tarrow 1994). In the absence of powerful social forces on their side – quite the
              | contrary in the Reagan era – veteran activists from the 1960s did more than bide their
              | time. Some spread environmental consciousness and green politics (with a perfect
              | target in the environmental policies of Interior Secretary James Watt), while others
              | developed through experimentation labor’s new “organizing model.” They have
              | fought through the system into positions of leadership and responsibility. Most im-
              | portantly, they have kept the flame burning for a new activist generation.
              | The evidence: Coalition building
              | This paper is intended more as a provocative research design than as the presentation
              | of a fully formed argument. The resurgence of labor, environmental and campus activ-
              | ism is demonstrated here in case studies of coalition building that together indicate the
              | growing salience of contemporary reform movements. While labor is at the center of
              | this analysis, environmental, campus, antiwar and other movements – and especially
              | the growing linkages among them – are as essential for the prospects of national and
              | global reform.
              | After 40 years of declining business unionism, the American labor movement an-
              | nounced at least the possibility of revitalization in its impressive coalition-building ef-
              | forts for the Seattle demonstrations of 1999. Campaigns with environmentalists in
              | battles against NAFTA (1993) and fast track (1997-98) inspired a broad Alliance for
              | Sustainable Jobs and the Environment (Shoch 2001; Rose 2000), that itself laid the
              | groundwork for the demonstrations in Seattle against the policies of the WTO. Em-
              | powered by the broad nature of this global justice coalition, activists fanned out into
              | growing and often successful local coalition efforts aimed at a broad range of issues,
              | from living wage and anti-sweatshop to peace and sustainable economic development.

text          | The building of active coalitions – most of them at the local level – has been a
              | central component of the revitalization of the American labor movement since the
              | early 1990s. The Seattle coalition, which brought together 30,000 demonstrators or-
              | ganized by labor groups with 20,000 from environmental, religious, human rights and
              | other groups to protest World Trade Organization policies, was only the most dra-
              | matic manifestation of the growing coalition phenomenon (Hawken 2000). Since the
              | plant-closing coalitions of the 1980s, accelerating since the mid-1990s, key unions ha-
              | ve moved beyond traditional bases, in some cases to build enduring alliances with
              | human rights, environmental, religious, student, feminist, and other community
              | groups. In response (and perhaps wisely from a political perspective), the Bush ad-
              | ministration has attempted to break apart such coalitions, signing up several unions,
              | for example, to support the campaign for Arctic oil drilling. The continuing revitaliza-
              | tion of the American labor movement may well depend on the success or failure of
              | labor in redefining itself as a broad partisan force, in lasting national and local coali-
              | tions with a broad range of social groups.
              | As part of a broader picture of revitalization, coalitions have increased in impor-
              | tance for particular activist unions, especially for those with a strong commitment to
              | organizing (including, for example, SEIU, HERE, CWA and UNITE). Labor-backed
              | coalitions cover a wide variety of local concerns, in addition to national alliances with
              | environmental (and other) groups around issues such as fair trade (Rose 2000). At the
              | same time, the environmental movement has developed an increasingly significant
              | “environmental justice” dimension, opening the door to expanded social coalitions
              | (Shabecoff 2000). And a new generation of student activists has built reform coali-
              | tions extending across campus, into the community and even into national and global
              | politics.
              | The paradox for advocates of democratic globalism is that most of these coalition
              | efforts are local. Building on local groups, issues and leaders, such coalitions nonethe-
              | less reflect the economic and social realities of a global economy. Local activists, to be
              | sure, may not “think globally” at all, even as their campaigns serve as carriers of a
              | broader reform vision.7 But just as local coalitions laid the groundwork for the mas-
              | sive Seattle demonstrations, such groupings increasingly and inevitably are drawn into
              | global issues and debates – from immigration and corporate accountability to invest-
              | ment, skills training and tax policy. And some of the most promising coalition-
              | building cases take place in so-called “global cities,” where concentrations of global
              | capital collide with growing low-end service (and often largely immigrant) workforces
              | (Sassen 1998).
              | American unions are still far less global in orientation than they need to be. While
              | international solidarity networks are expanding (Gordon and Turner 2000; Nissen
              | 2002), the major contribution of American unions and other interest groups and social
              | movements to democratic globalism remains at the local and national levels, pushing
              | from within the superpower for economic, social and environmental policy reform.

              | Coalition case studies
              | While most national unions (led by the AFL-CIO) sat out the social movements of the
              | 1960s, local unions here and there, in cities such as San Francisco, Seattle and New
              | York, did participate in antiwar and civil rights coalitions (Turner 2003). As those
              | movements declined in the 1970s, labor’s limited participation also declined; and not
              | coincidentally labor’s isolation deepened and membership density dropped in the face
              | of growing employer opposition. In response to deep recession and plant closings in
              | the 1980s, labor-community coalitions finally emerged in defensive campaigns to save
              | factories and jobs (Brecher and Costello 1990). On that foundation, a new wave of la-
              | bor-backed coalition efforts, some strategic and enduring, emerged in the 1990s across
              | a range of issues. Of particular recent interest are the following examples of strategic
              | coalition building, presented here as partial findings from ongoing research.8
              | Journalist Robert Kuttner has described the living wage movement as “the most in-
              | teresting (and under-reported) grassroots enterprise to emerge since the civil rights
              | movement” (quoted in Pollin and Luce 1998, p.1). In cities large and small across the
              | country, coalitions of activists, often labor-led, campaign for local minimum wages (at
              | least for government-contracted or subsidized work) considerably higher than the na-
              | tional minimum wage, with notable cases of success. Examples include the Commu-
              | nity Labor Alliance in Connecticut (with living wage laws passed in New Haven in
              | 1997 and Hartford in 1999), the Santa Clara County Central Labor Council in alliance
              | with Working Partnerships USA and sixty groups (pushing the San Jose City Council
              | to adopt living wage policies in 1998; Brownstein 2000), and the Los Angeles Living
              | Wage Coalition (with broad popular and deep political support resulting in victory in
              | 2000). In most cases, successful coalitions are led by local unions with active national
              | union support, with networks of overlapping activists in long-term regularized rela-
              | tionships among a variety of community-based groups, including social movements,
              | churches and political organizations. Broad success for the living wage movement is
              | indicated in the spread of new legislation: over 70 American cities had passed living
              | wage laws by 2002 (Luce 2002; Reynolds and Kern 2001).
              | The anti-sweatshop movement of the late 1990s and beyond offers another example
              | of successful coalition building, in this case for campus-based local movements origi-
              | nally inspired (but no longer led) by organized labor.9 UNITE has from the start been

              | hold on American campuses after the first Union Summer in 1996. A project of the
              | new Sweeney-led AFL-CIO, Union Summer placed hundreds of young people in
              | summer internships in organizing and collective bargaining campaigns, encouraging
              | them to build centers of labor activism on their return to the workplace or college
              | campus. Inspired by these returning activists, the anti-sweatshop movement grew rap-
              | idly and dramatically, with successful sit-ins at universities as diverse as Duke, Brown,
              | Michigan, Wisconsin, Penn, Arizona, Georgetown and North Carolina. While UNITE
              | and Union Summer helped to launch the movement and UNITE has underwritten the
              | costs of USAS national meetings, case study interviews indicate that campus-based
              | coalitions are significantly autonomous. Supporting each other when possible, work-
              | ing together loosely in USAS, activists have built distinct local coalitions with a variety
              | of campus, religious, community groups and local unions. Critical components of suc-
              | cess in the growth and development of the campus anti-sweatshop movement appear
              | to include: national union support (especially at the beginning, for resources and edu-
              | cation, and for continuing USAS conference funding); the building of lasting local or-
              | ganizations (SAS and related coalitions); and the capacity to mobilize thousands of
              | students for demonstrations, sit-ins and other activities.
              | In some ways the most problematic yet at the same time most promising coali-
              | tions are sustainability alliances, with labor and environmental groups at the core (Mo-
              | berg 1999; Rose 2000). When these two groups – often adversaries in the past – work
              | together, the potential for both national political influence and local mobilization is
              | great. Recent research shows that in spite of stereotypes, relations between labor and
              | environmental groups are on the whole quite positive (Obach 1999). Today there are
              | scores of such coalitions working together on a wide variety of issues, from living
              | wage and anti-sweatshop campaigns to toxic waste sites, workplace health and safety,
              | clean air and global warming. A recent potentially path-breaking example is the Apollo
              | Project, advocating a 10-year $300 billion research plan to promote hybrid and hydro-
              | gen cars and clean energy factories and appliances, thereby promoting manufacturing
              | and construction jobs in the U.S. and at the same time fighting environmental pollu-

              | Local coalition efforts continue to thrive in dozens of cities and regions.
              | Observing that labor-environmental coalitions are often “cross-class alliances,”
              | Fred Rose emphasizes the role of bridge builders – those who have been upwardly or
              | downwardly mobile or have social movement histories that push them across the di-
              | vide (Rose 2000).11 Also typically present in the building of labor-environmental coali-
              | tions are strong support from national organizations, overlapping networks of activists
              | in the different organizations, and an ongoing history of common effort leading to
              | processes of alliance institutionalization.
              | Closely related to living wage and anti-sweatshop campaigns are union-initiated
              | coalitions conceived in support of labor campaigns that develop long-term strategic
              | potential. One example is SEIU’s Justice for Janitors, essentially a national effort to reor-
              | ganize urban building services after a period of de-unionization. Faced with the loss of
              | members as building owners eliminated jobs and turned to janitorial service contrac-
              | tors in the 1980s, SEIU developed a combined organizing, bargaining and civil rights
              | strategy based on the corporate campaign model with special attention to building
              | coalitions in specific communities. This has been a national effort based on the mobi-
              | lization of local union activists in coalition with local churches, community organiza-
              | tions, and labor-friendly elected officials. In some cities the coalitions have been tem-
              | porary or sporadic, but in other cities they have endured. Perhaps the best example is
              | Los Angeles where thousands of largely Hispanic janitors have been organized and
              | won major contract improvements in a series of successive campaigns from the early
              | 1990s through a dramatic strike victory in 2000, each campaign building a broader and
              | deeper level of community support (Erickson et. al. 2001; Milkman and Wong 2001).12
              | In spite of these promising examples, the reality is that most American unions
              | continue to think about coalitions in more narrow, defensive terms. This is true even
              | where unions have relied on comprehensive campaigns as a source of leverage during
              | contract negotiations and organizing drives. Outreach to potential allies for support in
              | pressuring employers tends to be on union terms, and typically dissolves when the
              | campaign ends. Although such outreach may help in the effort to reconstruct labor as
              | a broad partisan force, sustainable momentum requires more lasting relationships.
              | Increasingly indispensable for organizing, political action and international soli-
              | darity, coalition building is critical to the current revitalization of the American labor
              | movement. Moving beyond the “special interest group” mentality of business union
              | traditions, coalition-building unions seek to broaden community bases while expand-
              | ing political influence.

text          | The argument summarized
              | For the cases presented above and many more, progressive coalitions including labor
              | have developed and deepened across the United States over the past decade. In cities
              | such as Los Angeles, the result has been the wholesale transformation of local poli-
              | tics.13 Coalition case studies offer preliminary but important evidence pointing toward
              | key causal factors at work in the emergence of contemporary forces for political, eco-
              | nomic and social reform.
              | Expanded coalition building among revitalized activist groups appears to be a driving
              | force and necessary condition for the growing significance of reform forces and their
              | budding alternative vision (itself local and national as well as global). While the other
              | two necessary conditions, inequality and strategic leadership, cannot be fully devel-
              | oped here, their importance is demonstrated in processes of labor-led coalition build-
              | ing, presented above and summarized as follows.
              | Growing inequality is clearly an important underlying economic condition pushing
              | labor toward coalitions such as living wage, anti-sweatshop and Justice for Janitors.
              | Economic and social polarization, seen for example in the decay of inner cities, has
              | also inspired the emergence within the environmental movement of a new focus on
              | environmental justice, opening the possibility of broadened coalition efforts with la-
              | bor, human rights, religious and community groups. And contemporary campus is-
              | sues, from USAS to solidarity with university workers and their collective bargaining
              | campaigns, are in many cases driven by a passionate outrage at the massive inequalities
              | of global, national and local economies. Corporate corruption scandals have only
              | magnified the awareness and readiness for protest action, especially of an increasingly
              | activist young generation.
              | Strategic leadership appears to be the third necessary condition for the growing sig-
              | nificance of contemporary reform forces. Most obviously, the election of an insurgent
              | slate at the AFL-CIO in 1995 has expanded the strategic vision of a considerable
              | “vanguard” (if still a minority) of American unions, shifting emphasis toward organiz-
              | ing and rank-and-file mobilization and encouraging progressive coalition building
              | (Bronfenbrenner et al. 1998; Turner, Katz and Hurd 2001). In a parallel development,
              | the movement for environmental justice has transformed the thinking of key envi-
              | ronmental leaders, moving the focus beyond wilderness preservation to urban revitali-
              | zation and sustainable development coalitions (Rose 2000; Shabecoff 2000). On
              | American college campuses, a new generation of activist leadership has emerged, with
              | an expansive view of coalition building and reform possibilities.14 Strategic leadership

              | David Brower, for example, each played key roles in bringing together the Alliance for
              | Sustainable Jobs and the Environment and the subsequent Seattle coalition – and at
              | local levels, where bridge builders with cross-movement experiences or perspectives
              | are especially important.15
              | In addition to coalition building, inequality and strategic leadership, two more
              | factors appear to matter in explaining the growing strength of reform forces. One is
              | the political opportunity structure. Clearly, corporate scandals open the door for reform ef-
              | forts. Yet the breadth of successful living wage and anti-sweatshop campaigns in a
              | great variety of American cities and universities (pre-dating the corporate corruption
              | epidemic of 2002) suggests that other factors – strategic leadership, coalition building,
              | chronic inequality – may be more important, something for future research to con-
              | sider. The other significant factor is grassroots mobilization, present to a significant extent
              | in all of our successful coalition campaign cases. How and why such mobilization, par-
              | ticipatory politics at its best, becomes possible is also a question for future research. Is
              | mobilization a causal factor in itself, making everything else possible, or is mobiliza-
              | tion a sort of “natural force” that occurs spontaneously when the door is opened (and
              | when other factors such as inequality, strategic leadership and coalition building are in
              | place)?
              | The literature reconsidered
              | Findings presented here challenge various perspectives in comparative industrial rela-
              | tions, political economy and sociology. This can be illustrated through a focus on con-
              | trasting analyses of labor.
              | Postwar industrial relations analysis in the U.S. operated within a dominant
              | American-centered, pluralist perspective, assuming a stable social system and well
              | functioning sub-systems such as industrial relations, with a focus on institutions and
              | the details and effects of policies such as collective bargaining (Dunlop, 1958;
              | Dahrendorf 1959; Kerr, Dunlop, Harbison and Myers 1960; Slichter, Livermore and
              | Nash 1960). The mutual recognition of the two major actors, business and labor, en-
              | sured stability of the industrial relations system. According to this perspective, mutual
              | recognition was itself the consequence of the withering away of class conflict across
              | the advanced world and its substitution with the joint search for technocratic solu-
              | tions to the problems of industrialism (Dunlop, 1958; Kerr, Dunlop, Harbirson and
              | Myers, 1960).

              | comparative perspective in the 1970s and 1980s by a new European-based literature
              | on democratic corporatism (Schmitter and Lehmbruch 1979; Berger, 1981;
              | Lehmbruch and Schmitter, 1982; Goldthorpe 1984). While the new literature broad-
              | ened the scope of analysis, moving labor and business out of the sub-system and into
              | more central positions in the political economy in line with their place in most western
              | European societies, the focus remained on institutions and policies. Each of these
              | contending perspectives, pluralism and corporatism, served as precursors for the new
              | institutionalism of the 1980s and 1990s (Hall 1986; March and Olsen 1989; Steinmo,
              | Thelen and Longstreth 1992).
              | In the meantime, social and economic stability in North America and western
              | Europe came undone with the war in Vietnam and the social movements of the 1960s
              | and early 1970s. A new literature appeared, seeking to understand and explain the rise
              | and fall of social movements. Although the late 1960s and early 1970s were marked by
              | strike waves (legal and wildcat) across western Europe and North America, the social
              | movement literature focused largely on movements such as civil rights, anti-war,
              | women’s and environmental. While a few studies brought labor and social movements
              | together in a limited way (Crouch and Pizzorno 1978; Sabel 1982), analytical currents
              | moved significantly apart. While labor was viewed for the most part as an established
              | force with institutional support (and perhaps thus even part of the problem rather
              | than the solution), social movements were seen as fresh, insurgent, and fighting for
              | space within the political economy and society (Offe, 1985; Habermas, 1989).
              | In other words, just as American labor largely failed to ride the social movement
              | wave of the 1960s (Turner 2003), so too did the literatures on industrial relations and
              | political economy fail to incorporate the insights of a rich, new social movement lit-
              | erature. And with the decline of the social movements of the 1960s, the narrow focus
              | persisted. By the 1980s, however, it was impossible to ignore the increasing effects of
              | global economic pressure as well as the newly aggressive posture on the part of many
              | firms and states.
              | While the literature on corporatism challenged American pluralist thought from a
              | comparative perspective (e.g., labor plays a very different role in different societies),
              | the next wave of American literature accepted pluralist assumptions but challenged
              | conventional industrial relations views based on sub-system stability (Kochan, Katz
              | and McKersie 1986). In a context of economic crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, this new
              | perspective emphasized the strategic choice of employers in the U.S., who increasingly
              | opposed unions and undermined traditional collective bargaining arrangements in
              | their response to competitive world markets (Piore and Sabel 1984). Dynamic markets
              | and employer opposition (often backed by government policy) resulted in serious and
              | accelerating union decline in the U.S., destabilizing and in some cases marginalizing
              | the traditional industrial relations sub-system while offering little hope for unions be-
              | yond concession bargaining and the acceptance of new employer-led flexibility and la-
              | bor-management cooperation. Labor’s decline in the U.S. and U.K. together with the
              | hegemony of Reagan/Thatcher free-market policies would have far reaching effects
              | on unions and workforces everywhere in an increasingly global economy.

              | While the labor literature of the 1990s was dominated by strategic choice on the
              | one hand and institutionalism on the other, a new mobilization perspective emerged
              | hand-in-hand with the revitalization of labor movements, especially in the U.S. and
              | U.K. (Johnston 1994; Bronfenbrenner et al. 1998; Hurd 1998; Heery 1998; Kelly 1998;
              | Milkman and Wong 2001; Turner, Katz and Hurd 2001). In contrast to earlier litera-
              | ture, revitalization research emphasized the key role of union strategies, of unions and
              | workers as actors with choices that matter. Early postwar theorists (industrial relations
              | scholars, political scientists, sociologists) had seen unions as integrated, stable parties
              | to enduring bargaining arrangements, with rank-and-file participation largely unneces-
              | sary (except in political elections and every once in a great while in the event of a
              | strike). Workforce demobilization was an assumption common to theorists of Ameri-
              | can business unionism and European corporatism alike. Kochan, Katz and McKersie,
              | by contrast, reflected the break-up of postwar stability and viewed unions to a large
              | extent as victims of global markets, employer opposition and state policy. While un-
              | ions did have choices, none were very promising, with options limited by employer at-
              | titudes and competitive markets: cooperation and limited participation seemed to
              | some the best route but offered little hope for turning around the protracted decline
              | of the American labor movement (cf. Kochan 1995; Kochan and Osterman, 1994).
              | The new institutionalism also emphasized unions, employers and government as
              | actors integrated into a more or less stable framework of laws, organizations and regu-
              | larized relationships. With behavior shaped by institutional and political constraints,
              | however, labor was largely marginalized in the U.S. and U.K. in the 1980s and early
              | 1990s, with little hope for any fundamental change.16 In all of these earlier perspec-
              | tives, whether unions were nicely integrated or unfortunate victims, there was little
              | room for labor as a movement, for coalition building, for expanded rank-and-file ac-
              | tivism, for activist leadership committed to reform, for an expansion of democracy in
              | the workplace and beyond.
              | The latest wave of labor scholarship, by contrast, examines the potential for un-
              | ions to serve as pro-active organizers, system builders, grappling with and shaping the
              | challenges they face, to a large extent through coalition building and the mobilization
              | of participation (Bronfenbrenner et al. 1998; Kelly 1998; Turner, Katz and Hurd
              | 2001). This latest literature thus brings together insights from the long neglected (or
              | pigeon-holed) social movement literature with strategic choice from industrial rela-
              | tions and the new or historical institutionalism from comparative political economy.
              | Strategic choice and institutional literatures offered important breakthroughs, in
              | particular regarding concepts such as actor choice, strategic alternatives, transforma-
              | tion, and the powerful shaping influence of existing institutions. But both perspectives
              | are also flawed. None of their conceptual frameworks, for example, could have pre-
              | dicted the AFL-CIO turn toward organizing, coalition building, and local mobilization

text          | See, for example, Thelen 2001. The most recent incarnation of the comparative institu-
              | tional perspective, to which Thelen’s work contributes, is the “varieties of capitalism” lit-
              | erature (Hall and Soskice 2001). In this view, labor is for the most part either nicely inte-
              | grated in the “coordinated market economies” or hopelessly marginalized in the “liberal
              | market economies.”

text          | and the very real possibility of labor movement revitalization. Both postwar industrial
              | relations and new institutional perspectives favor system stability, taking institutions
              | and bargaining arrangements as given. Strategic choice with its focus on transforma-
              | tion is more dynamic, reflecting changing world markets and power relations; yet the
              | emphasis is still on shoring up collective bargaining and shifting toward labor-
              | management cooperation. Current revitalization literature, by contrast, seeks to inte-
              | grate institutions, global markets and debates, coalition building and rank-and-file mo-
              | bilization into a comprehensive actor-based framework, with a focus on describing
              | and explaining contemporary activism, its presence or absence, successes and failures,
              | effects both narrow and broad.
              | Rejuvenated labor, environmental and campus movements in the U.S., as indi-
              | cated in living-wage, anti-sweatshop, sustainable development and Justice for Janitors
              | campaigns (and much more), offer surprising evidence for the resurgence of progres-
              | sive activism in America, at a critical historical juncture in which contrasting global vi-
              | sions are just beginning to contend for prominence.
              | Concluding remarks
              | There is no reason to believe that the global economy cannot be constructively re-
              | formed in a contemporary, coalition-led push toward democratic globalism. To be
              | sure, the barriers are high, but new possibilities are also present. While we can only
              | speculate at this point about the institutions and policies that would predominate in a
              | democratic globalist world (and the typical safe academic approach by contrast is to
              | give all the reasons why the current one-sided and corrupt market globalism will con-
              | tinue to dominate), we can point to some of the essential social forces coalescing
              | around reform efforts. Here in the world’s only remaining superpower, revitalized la-
              | bor, environmental and campus groups have been critical actors in promoting reform
              | aimed at local, national and global conditions. Predominantly local, such coalitions,
              | taken together across the United States, amount to a substantial movement for broad
              | economic and social policy reform, an American movement with potentially global
              | ramifications.
              | The argument presented here first contends that this revitalization of social forces
              | in the U.S. is significant enough to need explanation, and, second, presents evidence
              | pointing toward key causal forces at work: chronic inequality, strategic leadership, and
              | most importantly coalition building. Because inequality is increasingly highlighted in
              | contemporary corporate scandals, because labor, environmental and campus move-
              | ments now offer strategic leadership with a greatly expanded perspective, and because
              | coalition building among these and other groups is rampant across a range of issues,
              | especially at the local level but increasingly at national and global levels as well, there is
              | reason to hope for the expansion of substantial ongoing reform efforts, right here in
              | the so-called “belly of the beast.”
