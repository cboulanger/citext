              | COMPETITIVENESS
              | OF THE REGION:
              | CONTENT, FACTORS,
              | POLICIES
              | The article describes a framework concep-
              | tion of regional competitiveness. The notion of
              | regional competitiveness as well as approaches
              | to the classification of competitiveness factors
              | are considered in detail. The author elaborates
              | a set of indicators of regional competitiveness.
              | The article also discusses three groups of
              | factors which can influence the competitive-
              | ness of any region.
              | Key words: region, competition,
              | competitiveness, location based competi-
              | tion, exogenous factors of regional com-
              | petitiveness, endogenous factors of re-
              | gional competitiveness.
              | Competitiveness is a popular term which is used by economists, offi-
              | cials, and policy-makers to justify actions that should be implemented in
              | order to improve the status of an object relative to other objects having simi-
              | lar characteristics, in terms of its performance compared to other objects of
              | the same class. In particular, industrial policy is seen as a set of activities
              | aimed at improving competitiveness of certain categories of producers (e. g.
              | national producers), or goods (services)1 manufactured in the country (re-
              | gion).
              | However, despite the widespread use of the concept of competitiveness
              | in general and that of competitiveness of the region in particular, there are
              | often quite serious difficulties with offering an operational concept of com-
              | petitiveness, especially when it concerns the content of the term.
              | The phenomenon of regional competitiveness implies a complex of char-
              | acteristics, each of which is essential for understanding this phenomenon as
              | a whole. Indeed, the phenomenon of competitiveness in the socio-economic
              | 1 We will not consider the criteria of belonging to the category of domestic produc-
              | ers. We will only note that it is not a trivial issue, because the mere fact that goods
              | and services are produced on a specific territory (in this case in Russia or the terri-
              | tory of a region) is not a sufficient reason to qualify it as a domestic or regional
              | producer.

              | system can hardly be considered outside the relevant context of interaction
              | between the actors, without defining the characteristics of competitiveness,
              | or without identification of the necessary criteria to assess the level of com-
              | petitiveness or its modifications. These aspects are closely intertwined, that
              | is why an orderly presentation of their conjunction is essential for the forma-
              | tion of a unified vision of competitiveness of any subject in general (includ-
              | ing companies, organizations, national economy, etc.), and the region in
              | particular.
              | The main goal of this article is to formulate a framework of the concept
              | of regional competitiveness. The “framework” of the concept implies, first
              | and foremost, a number of general issues of regional competitiveness, which
              | should be specified in relation to a specific territory (a region or a group of
              | regions).
              | Achieving the goal involves a set of tasks, including:
              | • identification and description of the key components of the theory of
              | competition by location;
              | • elaboration of the content of regional competitiveness as an analytical
              | tool necessary to define a strategy for regional development;
              | • identification of the factors conditioning the competitiveness of a region;
              | • elaboration of regional competitiveness indicators;
              | • use of non-quantification characteristics of the region's competitiveness.
              | We will assume that a region is a relatively separate area with a set of
              | characteristics significant in terms of economic exchanges in general, and
              | entrepreneurship, in particular, but at the same time not possessing such
              | attributes of national sovereignty as its own currency, armed forces, foreign
              | policy and, therefore, not providing services such as: national security and
              | macroeconomic stability. Isolation of the territory may be manifested in
              | different forms, ranging from the existence of customs borders, either de
              | facto or de jure, to simply registration of a company as a legal entity in a
              | given territory. It is necessary to emphasize that regions may differ in some
              | individual characteristics of their institutional environment, for instance the
              | capacity of regional authorities to establish formal rules and mechanisms and
              | to ensure compliance with all these rules, both formal and informal.
              | 1. Location-based competition
              | The understanding of the competitiveness of the region, as one of its im-
              | portant features, is largely dependent on the content of the notion of compe-
              | tition because competitiveness virtually refers to the subject and/or the result
              | of a certain activity, while competition is a situation, or a process where
              | this competitiveness occurs (and/or is formed) irrespective of the category
              | of subjects, which participants of competition belong to (business entities,
              | national economies, regions, etc.)
              | In other words, competitiveness occurs when a subject, whose competi-
              | tiveness is being characterized, is in a privileged position vis-à-vis other
              | actors/ subjects or at least does not worsen its position in relation to other
              | actors (competitors). That is why, it is important to understand that there is a
meta          | 11
text          | Region and Regionalization
              | conjunction between the notion of competition and competitiveness, and
              | there is a separate issue of identification (including a quantitative one) of the
              | degree of preponderance through a set of indicators.
              | That is why understanding the content and possible forms of competition
              | creates an essential condition for giving a systemic definition and study of
              | the problem of competitiveness. Before we touch upon various types of
              | competition, it should be noted that the understanding of competition is also
              | varied. However, our task does not include a detailed analysis of the content
              | of competition and major consequences that the chosen definition implies.
              | We will focus on two approaches to defining competition: the static and
              | dynamic ones.
              | In accordance with the static approach, competition is a situation in
              | which achievement of the goal by one subject is at the same time effec-
              | tively limited by the competitor’s desire to achieve the same goal. To put
              | it otherwise, the key feature of static competition is inaccessibility of the
              | same “benefit” for several subjects simultaneously. Though availability of
              | the same benefit for different subjects is possible if the benefit is public (one
              | of the distinguishing features is absence of competition in consumption. For
              | example, the emergence of additional viewers of fireworks does not lead to
              | inaccessibility of the fireworks as a spectacle for others2).
              | In accordance with the dynamic approach, competition is a process of
              | discovering new opportunities for the use of the already known re-
              | sources, as well as a process of using or creating new resources [4]. Since
              | the discovery of new opportunities is often associated with the use of infor-
              | mation and exchange of knowledge in society, competition can also be seen
              | as a process of identifying and sharing knowledge and information about
              | quality, and about alternatives to using various resources in various possible
              | variants of their use [1, p. 316].
              | Unless it is specified otherwise, in future we will use the term competi-
              | tion in its static understanding, when dealing with the problem of competi-
              | tiveness of the region without special emphasis on the composition and
              | change of structure of the political market at the regional level. We will only
              | note that the functioning of the political market may lead to both widening
              | and narrowing of opportunities for entrepreneurial activities which are fo-
              | cused on creating value rather than its redistribution or destruction. It does
              | not follow from what has been said that the dynamic approach to the defini-
              | tion of competition is inapplicable to the situation of interaction of economic
              | agents on the goods and service market while determining competitiveness
              | of the object under research.
              | Forms of competition, in the static sense, are manifold. In particular, it is
              | well known that economic theory distinguishes between the following types
              | of competition: price and non-price competition, fair and unfair, current and
              | intertemporal, product and location, ex ante and ex post, for the market and
              | in the market, as well as actual and potential ones.
              | 2 Strictly speaking, this benefit can be attributed to the «transferred» to public, when
              | after a certain point the marginal cost of providing this service begins growing.

              | Both the content of competition and competitive characteristics largely
              | depend on the properties of the product, which is the result of performance
              | of a corresponding subject, a party of competition. For example, if a product
              | (for example, a new computer programme) can easily cross the border but
              | registering the very fact of its production in the country requires significant
              | costs, then other factors of regional competitiveness such as, for example,
              | quality of life of the product’s manufacturer will be of importance.
              | If we regard competition between economic agents in the market as a
              | reference point and assume that the agents belong to the same market (in
              | terms of their product and geographic boundaries), which actually means
              | identical location, then this factor has no independent importance from the
              | point of view of competition. Weakening of this assumptions leads to the
              | following conclusions:
              | (1) location may affect the conditions of actual competition (and, conse-
              | quently, the competitiveness of the producer);
              | (2) location should be taken into account when assessing potential com-
              | petition and corresponding potential competitiveness.
              | The second point is important in case the actors do not compete directly
              | as they work on different markets, but the parameters of their activities, as
              | well as the results, are comparable. This mechanism is known as yardstick
              | competition [5].
              | Economic activity in general and entrepreneurship in particular, occur at
              | a certain time and in a certain place. Territorial identity, when the same en-
              | tity can not be located in different areas, or in other words, when the same
              | legal entity is registered in different regions and can not simultaneously
              | carry out the same activity in different regions, is very important because it
              | is a basis of location-based competition.
              | In its pure form, location-based competition will operate as follows.
              | Let’s assume that there are some isolated areas among which there are some
              | randomly distributed economic unit creating a certain value. Each economic
              | unit is the centre of decision-making, and the decisions reflect the interests
              | of the entity controlling the unit.
              | If the terms of interaction with other economic units and between this
              | unit and the entity in control of the territory are less favourable than else-
              | where, then for the decision maker in the given economic unit there emerge
              | incentives for the relocation of its economic activity to another territory. All
              | other things being equal, ceteris paribus, the more favourable the conditions
              | of entrepreneurial activity in the region, the more entrepreneurs would run
              | their business in the region. Moreover, it is important to note that this is not
              | necessarily true only speaking about the transfer of a business from one re-
              | gion to another. Competition can also take place indirectly when business
              | develops as a result of decisions made by those who live in this or that re-
              | gion and decide to set up their own business3. As a result, the number of
              | 3 It is important to make one reservation: we do not consider specific issues of spe-
              | cialization of a territory in production of a certain class of products; the default as-
              | sumption is that comparative advantages are important, but are not a sole determi-
              | nant of economic profile of the territory.

              | business registration and the number of businesses per a fixed number of
              | people (usually per 1000) grow.
              | It is clear that for effective location-based competition, many conditions
              | must be fulfilled. But the most important one is that the expected net profit
              | from the transfer from one territory to another (taking into account the dis-
              | count) must not be less than the cost of business transfer, that is, the costs to
              | be paid by the specified entity to move the business from one territory to
              | another.
              | The costs of business transfer are crucial to ensure the effectiveness of
              | competition ex post, i.e., for those businesses that are already operating in
              | the territory of one of the regions. The effectiveness of competition ex post
              | depends largely on the development level of the markets infrastructure, in-
              | cluding the markets for the buying/selling of businesses (especially when
              | this is a small and medium size business, which practically does not use
              | stock exchange mechanisms [3]), housing and other real estate, and labour.
              | The functioning of infrastructure markets involves a physical movement of
              | economic agents in territorial space (in economic theory, this kind of move-
              | ment, in the context of competition, is called “voting with one’s feet”).
              | In addition, consideration should be given to two more options for a
              | business — switching to the shadow scheme or abandoning business all to-
              | gether. In this case, the region's competitiveness as such should be separated
              | from the competitiveness of formal institutions, regulating the activities of
              | economic agents, and the competitiveness of similar institutions that regulate
              | the same activity but are outside the framework of government regulations
              | and security of property rights.
              | We would also like to emphasize that at the categorial level, there should
              | be a distinction between attractiveness (competitiveness) of the region for
              | entrepreneurship and that for living (free time consumption). The better the
              | transportation infrastructure, the higher the differentiation of the neighbour-
              | ing regions in their living conditions (the cost and quality of housing, envi-
              | ronment, etc.), the more actual the distinction becomes.
              | 2. Competitiveness of the territory
              | Understanding the notion of the competitiveness of the territory is
              | largely dependent on the context it is used in. Obviously, while studying
              | interregional links, first and foremost, there emerges a thesis of international,
              | interregional and, in general, inter-territorial trade. From this perspective, the
              | fundamental rationale behind the direction of the movement of goods and,
              | respectively, specialization is comparative advantages resulting from differ-
              | ent opportunities, alternative costs of goods production on these territories.
              | For all the complexity of modern theory of international trade, the basic
              | idea is simple. Territories (countries, regions) can, technically speaking,
              | produce the same (or quite intersecting) set of goods. However, an increase
              | in the volume of production of the same product will be directly related to
              | different levels of reduction in the production of other goods for different
              | countries.
meta          | 14
text          | Andrey Shastitko
              | However, one should take into account two important considerations
              | which are crucial for understanding the content of the region's competitive-
              | ness and conditions for its raising.
              | Firstly, in the theoretical models comparative advantages are initial con-
              | ditions for explaining the direction and scale of trade between territories.
              | However, in practice, identification of these comparative advantages in a
              | complex, diversified economy is a separate issue. Accordingly, the more
              | precise the mechanism with the help of which the comparative advantage is
              | revealed, the higher the competitiveness of the territory is. However, one
              | should admit that in bilateral trade, inadequacy in identifying the compara-
              | tive advantage may have a negative impact on trade partners.
              | Secondly, one can imagine a fairly unique, but yet an important case
              | when two countries' alternative costs of production of a fixed set of goods
              | are the same. The differences are only in the direct costs associated with
              | productivity factors. Does this mean that the two countries (or two regions)
              | are equally competitive? It is clear that substantial differences in productiv-
              | ity come from the characteristics of the regions, for example, from the regu-
              | latory regime.
              | Competitiveness is a relative (comparative) characteristic of the sub-
              | ject of actual or potential competition, regardless of the characteristics of
              | competition. As can be seen from the previous statement, it is necessary to
              | distinguish between competitiveness of an individual business entity (indus-
              | try) and the region's competitiveness. In terms of the market functioning
              | scheme, competitiveness of the region derives from the competitiveness of
              | its enterprises. The higher (lower) the competitiveness of enterprises, other
              | things being equal, the higher (lower) the region's competitiveness is. In its
              | turn, in the first approximation, competitiveness of an enterprise is expressed
              | in terms of how efficiently the production factors are used and what the
              | prices of these factors are. However, it should be born in mind that compa-
              | nies may belong to different sectors of economy; they may be different in
              | size, and in their organizational and legal forms. That is why, the specified
              | ratio is more complex in its character.
              | In addition, there is no uniform understanding of the competitiveness of
              | a separate business, industry or national economy in economic literature. In
              | Yassin and Yakovleva’s [7, p. 8] works there is a working definition of the
              | competitiveness of goods and services, which is the “ability to sell them
              | [goods and services — A. Sh.] at market prices getting normal profit”. By
              | default, it is assumed that the long term survival of a business in the market
              | is possible only if its average total costs are not lower than the market price,
              | which corresponds to the conditions of equilibrium in a competitive market.
              | However, as it was already indicated above, the static approach to the
              | definition of competition is not the only possible one. In principle, there are
              | five basic approaches to resolve the issue of operationalization of the con-
              | cept of competitiveness4:
              | 4 These results were obtained based on a study carried out by the “Bureau of Eco-
              | nomic Analysis” Foundation in 2001.

              | for the industry/company performance through the competitiveness of goods.
              | It should be noted that the names/terms used here, are not universally ac-
              | cepted but reflect the essence, the main characteristics of the described
              | methodology.
              | The task of elaborating the concept of the region’s competitiveness, de-
              | spite the relative simplicity of the general idea that can be laid at the founda-
              | tion of this concept, in fact may prove much more difficult than competitive-
              | ness of a branch of industry or a business.
              | Competitive location, in the first approximation, actually means that the
              | region is competitive; it can be viewed through the prism of contractual rela-
              | tionship between an entrepreneur (investor) and regional authorities. This
              | does not mean that such a contract must exist explicitly. Typically, there is a
              | hidden, implicit contract, which, however, can be reconstructed with the help
              | of the tools of economic analysis.
              | Since direct investments, if we do not take into account bank loans, are
              | subject to greater or lesser territorial fixedness, especially when it comes to
              | the construction of buildings, as well as to installing equipment which is
              | difficult to transport distance-wise, the principal concern for the investor is
              | not only the proposed conditions, but also guarantees that (a) they will not
              | change and (b) that the alleged conditions are consistent with the actual con-
              | ditions (rules and mechanisms to ensure compliance with them will be con-
              | sistent with each other). In other words, the task of regional authorities is to
              | ensure credibility of their commitments. Moreover, de facto the right to as-
              | sess reliability of this kind of promises is granted to business community.
              | Furthermore, this reliability consists of at least two parts. The first relates
              | to the reliability of the commitments of the regional authorities to create
              | such conditions, whereas the second is the reliability of commitments of the
              | authorities at a higher level, which, in terms of the classification factors of
              | competitiveness, can be attributed to exogenous ones.
              | However, as in any contractual relationship, the problems arising from
              | the formulation of commitments and ensuring compliance with them are
              | reciprocal. That is why the fulfilment of any agreement implies that the reli-
              | ability of commitments concerning the proposed entrepreneurial activity is
              | complemented by measures of control and effective restrictions on miscon-
              | duct and violations of the rules likely to be committed by economic entities.

              | Competitiveness of the region is closely intertwined with its economic
              | development, so the relation between the two phenomena requires special
              | attention.
              | If competition between regions for attracting business is aimed at creat-
              | ing value, then economic development can be regarded as a consequence of
              | this kind of competition. Consequently, competitiveness and economic de-
              | velopment of the region are positively linked.
              | A distinction should be drawn between economic development and eco-
              | nomic growth, due to possible changes in the resulting macro-economic indica-
              | tors in the first place, and the gross regional product, without innovation as a key
              | feature of economic development. In other words, economic growth is only
              | possible if there is an increasing the amount of resources and they are efficiently
              | used, while technology may remain unchanged, so may the assortment range of
              | products, acting organizational forms, a set of resources, as well as the market
              | composition of goods and services that the regions use.
              | Competitiveness, defined as survival of a business entity on the market,
              | is not linked explicitly to efficiency (at least in the short term perspective).
              | This may be due to the fact that business actors, competing with each other,
              | may have fundamentally different stocks of resources.
              | Let us consider in more detail the relationship between competitiveness
              | and economic development. At first glance, the relationship between com-
              | petitiveness and economic development is simple and unambiguous: the
              | more competitive the region is, the faster its economic development and vice
              | versa — the faster the economic development, the higher the competitive-
              | ness. However, when analyzing the relationship between the two phenom-
              | ena, a number of circumstances should be taken into account.
              | 1. The definition of competitiveness, as a rule, implies a correlation of
              | one entity and the other at the same point of time because competition takes
              | place in real time. In its turn, economic development is determined by a cor-
              | relation of successive emerging states of the same object. One exception is
              | intertemporal competition, when a business entity actually competes with
              | itself by supplying the market with durable goods.
              | 2. It is also possible to define competitiveness of producers outside the
              | context of economic development as situations in which, according to J.
              | Schumpeter, there are no new combinations which are being important signs
              | of economic development. It is clear that this is only a theoretical abstraction
              | which shows that one phenomenon (competitiveness) is not identical to the
              | other (economic development).
              | 3. However, an increase of competitiveness is related in an even more
              | complex way with economic development, because the way how to raise
              | competitiveness is of great significance. If it involves the creation of incen-
              | tives for economic agents to seek new ways of productive and efficient use
              | of the existing limited resources, and/or discover new resources, in this case
              | the factors enhancing competitiveness also act as economic development
              | factors. But if an increase of competitiveness of business entities, as well as
              | territories, is due to the industrial policy, resulting in a meaningful redistri-
              | bution of scarce resources in favour of certain categories of industries or
meta          | 17
text          | Region and Regionalization
              | producers, then as a consequence of distortion of incentives, these factors,
              | which are seemingly increasing the competitiveness of goods, do not create
              | sufficient incentives for economic development.
              | The main conclusion is that the content of economic development of the
              | region, considered in the context of competition between regions in the field
              | of business development and focused on creating value, and the content of
              | competitiveness of the region largely overlap.
              | 3. Factors of regional competitiveness
              | If competitiveness of the region is a relative characteristic of a territory,
              | defined in the context of competition as a certain process, then circum-
              | stances, actions of people, or groups of people, who have an impact on the
              | specified characteristics of the region will be defined as factors of competi-
              | tiveness.
              | Taking into account a close interconnection and, at the same time, some
              | ambiguity in the correlation between economic development and the com-
              | petitiveness of the region, it should be noted that the relation between them,
              | described in the previous section, is reflected in the factors of economic de-
              | velopment and competitiveness, respectively.
              | The classification of economic development factors of the region was
              | carried out by L. A. Grigoriev and Y. Urozhaeva [2]. In accordance with
              | their classification, three groups of factors are identified: “natural” (objec-
              | tive), factors external to the region and institutional ones. Accepting the ba-
              | sis of the proposed classification, we would like to point out, however, that
              | the above mentioned classification does not meet the requirements of the
              | theoretical classification, since the classification grounds are not clearly de-
              | fined and many factors within the groups may partly overlap. This fact will
              | be taken into account in the further discussion of the issue of the factors of
              | the competitiveness of the region. Since the region’s competitiveness (its
              | increase or sustaining its high level) is the goal of socio-economic policies,
              | there is also a practical question of how this goal can be achieved.
              | We can formulate several working criteria for a classification of the fac-
              | tors of the region’s competitiveness:
              | (1) the significance of the factor;
              | (2) the dependence of the factor on decisions taken by actors in the
              | socio-economic policies in the region;
              | (3) duration of the factor (short, medium and long term ones).
              | The following sections focus on the exogenous and endogenous factors
              | of competitiveness, i. e. factors of the second group. That is why, in this
              | section we will briefly comment on two other groups as well. In terms of
              | their impact on the level of competitiveness, the factors are not equal. For
              | example, if one considers the change in GDP as a reflection of entrepreneu-
              | rial activity, then among such factors as human capital, macroeconomic pol-
              | icy, and the quality of institutions the latter is most significant5 [9]. By insti-
              | 5 Note that some researchers point to interdependence of macroeconomic policy and
              | quality of institutions.

              | tutions we mean rules (formal and informal), as well as mechanisms to en-
              | sure compliance with them, including arrangements relating to the applica-
              | tion of sanctions to violators. Accordingly, if one compares the relative dy-
              | namics of the GDP during a reasonably long period of time, it will broadly
              | reflect the quality of institutions.
              | Exogenous factors are such factors of regional competitiveness, any
              | change in which is not a direct consequence of economic decisions and
              | actions, taken at the level of the region.
              | Exogenous factors include, first of all, institutional conditions of eco-
              | nomic activity reflected in the federal laws; they are connected to mecha-
              | nisms ensuring compliance with these laws through federal institutions and
              | their territorial branches. There is only one limitation: if this region is not
              | dominant in terms of creating system rules.
              | In this context decentralization and deregulation of economy can be im-
              | portant factors of enhancing competitiveness of peripheral regions, when the
              | right to make meaningful decisions and the corresponding tax sources are
              | delegated to the level of the region.
              | Integration processes in economies, that create a need for decisions re-
              | lated to business development at a larger scope than that of one particular
              | region, are of great importance too. First of all, it refers to large integrated
              | business groups (IBG). On the one hand, decisions concerning IBGs affect
              | many regions at once, so the influence on the behaviour of any IBG, which
              | presupposes reaching a certain “critical mass”, involves problems of a col-
              | lective action of the regions concerned. However, as a rule, IBGs make stra-
              | tegic decisions without any interaction with a group of interested regions.
              | At the same time, the number of IBGs whose interests are represented in
              | the region can be an important factor, just as important as the location of the
              | headquarters. As it was already mentioned, the presence of a large number of
              | IBGs in the region greatly diminishes the problem of dependence of regional
              | decisions on the interests of one separate IBG, particularly if IBGs are het-
              | erogeneous.
              | Another group of exogenous factors is associated with the state of key
              | resources before business entities, operating in the region and affecting its
              | competitiveness, make a decision. This is due to the fact that the history of
              | the region is important; it makes an impact on the competitiveness of differ-
              | ent forms of accumulated capital — human, physical and social, if the latter
              | implies a set of institutions.
              | Finally, another group of factors involves changes which are exogenous
              | both, in relation to the actions of the federal government and in relation to
              | the business behaviour of a vast majority of IBGs.
              | In particular, we are speaking about changes in the world commodity mar-
              | kets, as they are an important component of production in a corresponding re-
              | gion and export from the country in general. For Russia, this is, above all, en-
              | ergy (oil and gas), as well as products of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy.
              | However, it should be understood that within a fairly narrow food segment
              | there is a possibility of influence of the players’ decisions in the national econ-
              | omy, in terms of economic exchanges across the world market, which in its turn
              | could have the opposite effect on the competitiveness of a region.
meta          | 19
text          | Region and Regionalization
              | Thus, exogenous factors include:
              | (1) decisions of the federal government (including decision to devalue
              | the national currency, decision about privatization or nationalization of cer-
              | tain objects);
              | (2) decisions made in integrated business groups, whose activities are
              | carried out simultaneously in many regions;
              | (3) accumulated characteristics of production factors (fixed capital stock,
              | human capital, natural resources, organizational capital);
              | (4) fluctuations in world commodity markets.
              | All the factors listed above are not exogenous by definition if, for example, a
              | region itself or together with other regions can influence the decision of impor-
              | tant issues for the region (e.g., elaboration of the regional industrial policy).
              | Endogenous factors are such factors of regional competitiveness, the
              | change of value of which is a direct consequence of decisions and actions
              | of the economic policy at the level of the region.
              | One of the most important endogenous factors of the competitiveness of
              | the region is socio-economic policy of the authorities that affects the price,
              | which economic agents have to pay for services provided by the regional
              | authorities (institutional infrastructure, real infrastructure) and the quality of
              | these services. It has to be noted that a reduction in prices in the form of
              | easing the tax burden can be considered as a factor enhancing competitive-
              | ness of the region, which, nevertheless, can be outweighed by other factors;
              | firstly, due to poor quality of services, especially public benefits, and sec-
              | ondly, due to diminishing competitiveness in the future (a decrease in re-
              | gional public finance).
              | There is another aspect of the influence of socio-economic policies on the
              | region's competitiveness. Most clearly it can be seen in the ratio of industrial and
              | competition policies. Industrial policy is a redistribution of resources tar-
              | geted at specific industries or groups of companies. Competition policy
              | aims at creating incentives for economic agents in terms of generating in-
              | novation (technological, product, and organizational) by means of creation
              | and maintenance of competitive conditions in the target markets.
              | Strictly speaking, the establishment of formal institutions is the only
              | factor which the authorities can control. This factor affects the competitive-
              | ness of the region through incentives for those economic agents who make
              | decisions related to the creation of value, and also (if it would be preferable),
              | redistribution of value or even its destruction. From this perspective, loca-
              | tion competitiveness is, above all, competitiveness of institutions (na-
              | tional and regional).
              | In accordance with the approach proposed by Yassin and Yakovleva [7,
              | p. 8], the competitiveness of institutions is the compliance of formal and
              | non-formal institutions in the country (laws, norms and traditions of behav-
              | iour of the authorities, use of power, degree of freedom, the radius of trust)
              | with the requirements of production of competitive goods and services. In
              | connection with the given definition it is important to say the following:
              | 1. One can speak about not only the competitiveness of national institu-
              | tions, but also regional institutions competitiveness;
meta          | 20
text          | Andrey Shastitko
              | 2. It is necessary to confine to formal and informal rules governing the
              | interaction between economic agents, as well as the interaction of economic
              | agents with state authorities;
              | 3. Mechanisms ensuring compliance with the established rules should be
              | regarded as a special component of institutions. Rules for permitted (or pro-
              | hibited) actions should be consistent with best practices. But this is not
              | enough for the elaboration of adequate incentives.
              | 4. Indicators of regional competitiveness
              | The effect of the factors of regional competitiveness determine the char-
              | acteristics of the region, which were described in the second section in the
              | context of determining the quality characteristics that affect the incentives of
              | individuals taking economic decisions.
              | However, in order to operationalize this conception, it is important to
              | identify indicators of competitiveness.
              | As there are many factors as well indicators of competitiveness, it is nec-
              | essary to streamline them and analyze their relation to one another. The first
              | subsection deals with specific indicators of competitiveness which reflect
              | some aspects of the business agent’s performance. The second subsection
              | deals with the problem of formulating a generalized indicator of competi-
              | tiveness. The third subsection identifies indicators associated with competi-
              | tiveness.
              | Specific indicator is an indicator of the region's competitiveness,
              | which reflects a subset of location competition aspects.
              | In accordance with the existing standard approaches used to quantify
              | competitiveness, one can single out the following indicators: (1) productivity
              | level (2) labour cost per production unit, (3) the coefficient of identified
              | comparative advantages.
              | If the theory of international trade is taken as a starting point, then the
              | key indicator is associated with the comparative advantages of the country
              | (region). In research, the coefficient of identified comparative advantages is
              | used; it is calculated as the ratio of the share of the country (region) in the
              | world (national) market of the product (export) to the share of the country's
              | imports of this product (import from other regions6 [7, p. 16]).
              | Mathematically, this coefficient can be represented as follows [8]:
              | RCAi = (Xi /Σ Xi — Mi/Σ Mi) · 100,
              | where RCAi is the coefficient of the identified comparative advantages
              | which, theoretically, can change from -100 to 100, Xi/ΣXi is the country’s
              | share of world export, Mi / ΣMi is the country’s share of world import.
              | It should be noted at once that this indicator is not practicable for regions
              | for lack of adequate statistics on the movement of goods between regions
              | (without crossing national borders).
              | 6 Adjustment to the definition of the regional component is presented by the author
              | of the article.

              | Among the indicators that reflect individual aspects of the region's com-
              | petitiveness one can also take into account direct investments, changing
              | numbers of small enterprises per 1000 inhabitants (adjusted for the propor-
              | tion of non-operating SMEs), actually reflecting the intensity of the business
              | registration process.
              | The greater the number of SMEs per capita, given all other conditions
              | being equal, the more competitive the region is. In this thesis, the principle
              | of “other conditions being equal” is essential. It is clear that “traces” of re-
              | gional competitiveness can also be found in retrospect if we assume that the
              | dynamics of key indicators is the result of location-based competition. This
              | applies, above all, to such indicators as GRP, including GDP per capita,
              | current investments and others.
              | Among the most obvious indicators of competitiveness to be applied is
              | the amount of added value per worker. As the impact of economic activity is
              | estimated through added value, thus the more value is added in the region,
              | ceteris paribus, the more competitive the business operating in the region is,
              | and, consequently, the more competitive the region is (if one uses the logic
              | of competition by location in association with the region's competitiveness
              | on the one hand, and the correlation between the region's competitiveness
              | and competitiveness of the region's products, manufactured in the territory,
              | on the other). However, in most cases data on added value is not available.
              | Generalized indicator of competitiveness is the one that takes into
              | account all major aspects of competitiveness. The generalized indicator of
              | competitiveness is unlikely to have any dimension: it is, probably, a numeral
              | as is, for example, the indicator of elasticity. Approaches to the calculation
              | mechanism of this numeral may be different.
              | 1. One option: one can calculate the average fraction for the entire set of
              | major factors affecting competitiveness, assessing the significance and role
              | of each factor. If the value of this indicator for a particular region is above
              | average, then the region is competitive.
              | 2. Another option: choosing, as a starting point, the best value for the en-
              | tire set and comparing it with specific values obtained for the region. In this
              | case the value can not be greater than one (1), although it is possible that this
              | value will be equal to 1 (for the leader region).
              | 3. The third option: the reference point is maximum possible values of
              | the indicators, whereas the actual values for each region indicate deviations
              | due to the untapped reserves. In this case, the standard value would be less
              | than one (1) for all regions (including the leader region).
              | Among important indicators and characteristics of the region (which are
              | related to its competitiveness, but do not exhaust its full content, though they
              | are used as stand-alone characteristics of this region), one can point out in-
              | vestment attractiveness of the region and the regional budgets reflected in
              | the ratings of paying capacity.
              | In the comparative assessment of any region, various kinds of ratings are often
              | used as they can help sort out the regions according to the established criteria.
              | It should be noted that investment attractiveness ratings may indicate the
              | specialization of the region, if we assume that in the world markets there are
              | relatively stable favourable conditions for goods that are consistent with the
              | specialization of the region. That is why, there can be a positive correlation
meta          | 22
text          | Andrey Shastitko
              | between the level of investment attractiveness and competitiveness of the
              | region but it is not as strong as it may seem at first glance.
              | As the region is the subject of location-based competition, the state of
              | the regional budget is very important, because it reflects not only the current
              | but also future regime of entrepreneurial activity in the region. Indeed, if the
              | budget of the region is made with a significant deficit, and is financed
              | through borrowings in the financial market and financing of medium-and
              | long-term programmes is implemented through the “short” money, then in
              | terms of attractiveness, ceteris paribus, the region will lose.
              | 5. Enhancing competitiveness of the region with the help
              | of measures of socioeconomic policies at the regional level
              | Understanding the content of competitiveness in positive terms is of
              | great importance for the development of socio-economic policies, both at the
              | level of economy as a whole and at the level of the region, given a set of
              | exogenous and endogenous factors (variables). Interdependence of various
              | aspects of competitiveness with social and economic policy has many impor-
              | tant aspects, two of which we will pay special attention to.
              | There are three groups of tools, which can affect competitiveness of the re-
              | gion. They are applicable to both national governments as well as regional ones.
              | 1. General measures to strengthen the regional economy and its position
              | in national and world economy, leading eventually to an increase of com-
              | petitiveness of firms and their products. Such measures shall provide the
              | basis for competitiveness for national economy and that of the region. These
              | general measures include, first and foremost, institutional framework for
              | economic activities, related to the formation of business environment, re-
              | gardless of the expected gains of specific groups of businesses.
              | 2. State aid in the form of direct support to companies in their export ac-
              | tivities (grants, tax incentives, exemption from import duties on raw materi-
              | als, information support of export activities). For the regional government
              | this direction is less accessible than for the federal government (there is no
              | way to exempt from import duties on raw materials), as well as it involves
              | the risk of applying to them the norms of the federal law “On protection of
              | competition” in the event their activity restricts competition.
              | 3. Measures aimed at creating demand for regional producers in other
              | regions, as well as foreign markets (exhibitions, establishment abroad or in
              | other regions trade and information centres, etc.)
              | These measures are not completely equivalent in terms of setting appro-
              | priate incentives. However, they form a space for choice both in normal
              | conditions and in the conditions of a crisis. In this regard it should be noted
              | that the region's competitiveness will largely depend on the balance of meas-
              | ures aimed at improving its competitiveness.
              | Given the fact that the competitiveness of the region derives from the
              | competitiveness of products manufactured in its territory, identification of
              | strategies for improving the region's competitiveness in the context of im-
              | proving the competitiveness of the industries is of vital importance. It is
              | clear that the impact of efforts aimed at improving competitiveness of indus-
meta          | 23
text          | Region and Regionalization
              | tries will be different. Moreover, it is understandable that it is rational to
              | resolve issues related to enhancement of competitiveness of the region, fo-
              | cusing on enhancement of competitiveness of the industry with a bigger
              | competitiveness potential.
              | In this perspective there emerges a separate issue of a group of indus-
              | tries, both in terms of potential impact of improving competitiveness and in
              | terms of tools that can be used to enhance this competitiveness.
              | Problems with the use of indicators of competitiveness in quality control
              | actually minimize the risk of manipulating them. Let's try to explain the es-
              | sence of the problem. Let’s assume that all players use the assumption that
              | the proposed indicators are adequate, in terms of comparative assessment of
              | the region (its competitiveness).
              | If the welfare of a player depends on the level or the dynamics of this indica-
              | tor, there is a stimulus for a corresponding change of the indicator. Moreover,
              | the actors will look for ways to achieve this goal with minimum expenditures.
              | For example, if the dynamics of labour productivity is taken as a control indica-
              | tor, it might, other things being equal, encourage the use of labour-saving, capi-
              | tal-intensive technologies. However, in the circumstances where a relatively
              | cheap labour is a competitive advantage, in terms of resources, the choice of this
              | indicator may lead to reduced competitiveness (at least in some areas).
              | The assessment of competitiveness of the region involves a necessity to
              | take into account factors which are impossible or rather difficult to quantify.
              | This is especially true for factors that are actually very complicated, in
              | terms of structure. Among them is the quality of the institutional environ-
              | ment at the regional level, including not only the content of laws, but also
              | mechanisms ensuring compliance with them.
              | In this respect, so as to solve this issue, it is necessary to pay more atten-
              | tion to the characteristics of the institutional framework concerning the use
              | of limited resources, paying special attention to the significance of each of
              | the identified characteristics.
              | Understanding the above-mentioned issue will ensure more caution
              | when applying all quantitative estimates of all changes in competitiveness
              | and, on the one hand, will encouraged seeking methods of quantification for
              | “non-quantifiable”, for the time being, factors, on the other hand.
              | Conclusions
              | The presented material on regional competitiveness provides the follow-
              | ing conclusions:
              | 1. Competitiveness of the region is an important component in explain-
              | ing both the level of economic development and the living standards in the
              | region. That is why improving competitiveness of the region is an important
              | task of economic policy at both the federal and regional levels;
              | 2. Currently there is no generally accepted, rigorous and operational
              | definition of the term “competitiveness”, applicable to all cases of empirical
              | research in this area. This concerns the definition of the term in relation to
              | specific products or manufacturers, as well as to individual regions.
              | 3. However, competitiveness in the long run should be considered
              | through the prism of setting incentives for decision makers to seek new ar-
meta          | 24
text          | Andrey Shastitko
              | eas, to use the already known resources, as well as to identify unknown ex
              | ante resources of creating added value. This applies to business entities and
              | to those decision makers who determine the quality of the institutional envi-
              | ronment in the territory. This approach is based on interdependence of the
              | notions “competition” and “competitiveness”.
              | 4. Competitiveness of the region depends on many factors which can be
              | classified. In terms of decision-making process the most important groups
              | are endogenous and exogenous factors of competitiveness.
              | 5. In applied research a variety of techniques are used to assess competi-
              | tiveness on the basis of designing a set of indicators, each of which has com-
              | parative advantages and shortcomings. Among the most common are such
              | indicators as a comparative advantage, productivity and cost of labour per
              | unit of output. The choice of methods for assessing competitiveness depends
              | on the objective and accessible information. It should be born in mind that
              | available information is not always significant, and important information is
              | not always available. The ideal method applicable to all cases of assessment
              | of competitiveness has not been identified yet.
              | 6. It is necessary to distinguish between competitiveness of manufactur-
              | ers in the industry and market. If competitiveness of manufacturers in the
              | market is directly linked to the level of unit costs, competitiveness within the
              | industry (manufacturing heterogeneous and not always easily interchange-
              | able commodities) is linked to an additional factor — the choice of speciali-
              | zation which adequately reflects the manufacturer’s comparative advantage.
              | In its turn competitiveness of the region implies not only the cost factor but
              | also specific institutional conditions of production, which should lead to
              | differentiation of the producer’s costs not only because of natural compara-
              | tive advantages or benefits in the organization, but because of differences in
              | costs associated with compliance with the mandatory requirements estab-
              | lished by the State (at the federal and regional levels).
