              | Abstract
              | Only few previous studies have explored cross-national variation in the relationship
              | between educational certificates and competences. In this paper, we investigate the cer-
              | tificate-competence relationship, operationalized as skills gaps by level of educational
              | attainment. More importantly, we scrutinize how two aspects of educational stratifica-
              | tion processes, vertical stratification and occupation-specificity, affects skills gaps. Us-
              | ing data on 25-54 year olds from the 2011/12 round of the Programme for the Interna-
              | tional Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), we find that more occupation-specific
              | education systems produce smaller differences in basic general skills between adults
              | with low and intermediate levels of education. Higher levels of vertical stratification, by
              | contrast, result in larger low-intermediate skills gaps. None of the two stratification
              | aspects can however explain variations in the skills gaps between intermediate and
              | high educated adults. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for
              | labor market research.

              | 1. Introduction
              | Scholars agree that the relationship between educational degrees and competenc-
              | es or skills may vary across countries. Yet previous research has devoted surpris-
              | ingly little attention to the sources of this cross-national variability. To our
              | knowledge, only one quantitative study has attempted to explain country differ-
              | ences in the relationship between certificates and skills among adults: Using data
              | on 19 countries from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS, conducted be-
              | tween 1994-1998 by the OECD), Park and Kyei (2011) examined literacy differen-
              | tials by level of formal qualification (less than upper secondary education, upper
              | secondary or non-tertiary post-secondary education, and college/tertiary educa-
              | tion). They found substantial cross-national variation in literacy gaps between less
              | and intermediate educated adults and, to a lesser extent, also between adults with
              | intermediate and high levels of formal qualification (cf. Park and Kyei 2011:894-
              | 5). The main country-level explanatory variable examined by Park and Kyei was
              | within-country heterogeneity of school quality, measured as between-school ine-
              | quality of various resources (e.g., instructional resources, class size, or teacher
              | experience). They showed that greater between-school resource inequality is asso-
              | ciated with larger low-intermediate literacy gaps. Resource inequality, however,
              | did not explain differences in intermediate-high literacy gaps.
              | Quite strikingly, Park and Kyei (2011) did not consider differences in educa-
              | tional stratification processes as an explanatory factor. They argued that
              | “[b]ecause we are interested in literacy gaps between adults who did not graduate
              | from high school (or may never have attended high school) and adults with high
              | school degrees or higher, tracking is much less relevant for our study, even for
              | countries with tracking systems (unless the tracking occurs at an early age).
              | Moreover, studies that focus on tracking effects cannot address differences in oth-
              | er important aspects of educational systems among countries with the same type
              | of tracking system.” (Park and Kyei 2011:882) They decided to therefore “look at
              | institutional factors that are likely to be more universally relevant”, namely be-
              | tween-school inequality in basic school resources (Park and Kyei 2011:882).
              | In this study, we reconsider the potential role of educational stratification for
              | explaining skills gaps by educational attainment. We focus on two distinct types of
              | stratification: vertical stratification by student performance in lower secondary
              | education (e.g., via achievement-related tracking) and horizontal stratification in
              | terms of the primary content of educational programs in upper secondary educa-
              | tion (occupational/vocational vs. general). There are at least two reasons why we
              | should not rule out a priori that these two types of stratification condition the re-
              | lationship between formal certificates and competences. First of all, there is sub-
              | stantial variability in the extent of stratification. Taking the example of vertical
              | stratification, it is clear that countries do not simply track or not: Tracked educa-
              | tion systems differ with respect to things such as the number of tracks or the age
              | when tracking occurs (Bol and Van de Werfhorst 2013). Further, as we discuss be-
              | low, even non-tracked education systems may differ in terms of how strongly
              | – 1 –
              | high- and low-performing students cluster in the same schools and classrooms
              | (e.g., because of differences in residential segregation). Second, and relatedly,
              | there are strong reasons to expect that educational stratification influences the
              | relationship between formal qualifications and competences: Educational stratifi-
              | cation processes channel individuals into different learning environments (social-
              | ization) and/or different programs that lead to different levels of formal qualifica-
              | tion (allocation) (cf. Allmendinger 1989:236; Kerckhoff 1995:326; Meyer 1977).
              | Higher degrees of educational stratification may thus affect the relationship be-
              | tween competences and educational degrees via (competence-based) selection into
              | different (more or less favorable) learning environments or formal educational
              | programs (Gamoran 1986; Hallinan 1992).
              | More concretely, we extend the study by Park and Kyei (2011) in three ways.
              | First, we investigate the impact of educational stratification processes on skills
              | gaps by educational attainment, distinguishing between vertical (i.e., perfor-
              | mance-related) stratification of lower secondary education and horizontal stratifi-
              | cation, that is, occupation-specificity of upper secondary education. We also com-
              | pare the importance of these dimensions of educational stratification to that of
              | between-school inequality in instructional resources in lower secondary educa-
              | tion, the focal variable of Park and Kyei (2011). Second, we use new data from the
              | first round of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies
              | (PIAAC)—conducted in 2011/12 by the OECD. This data set contains information on
              | educational certificates and generic basic competences (literacy and numeracy) of
              | the adult population for more than 20 countries. Not only are the competence
              | measures in PIAAC of much higher quality than in IALS (see Section 3). PIAAC also
              | embraces a broader country sample, especially by including “achievement-
              | oriented” East Asian countries (Korea and Japan). Third, even though our empirical
              | contribution is restricted to (institutional sources of) cross-country variation in
              | skills gaps, we do discuss some important implications of our findings for the in-
              | terpretation of certificate and skills effects in labor market regressions.
              | The paper is structured as follows. We start with theoretical considerations
              | about country variation in skills gaps by educational certificates (Section 2). In
              | Section 3, we describe the PIAAC data and the methods used in our analyses. We
              | present our empirical analysis in Section 4. Section 5 concludes by summarizing
              | our findings and discussing their implications for studies of competence and cer-
              | tificate effects on labor market outcomes.

              | Country variation in skills gaps by educational
              | degrees
              | We investigate country differences in two “skills gaps” as indications of the rela-
              | tionship between competences and educational degrees: The “lower skills gap” is
              | defined as the (adjusted) difference in mean basic cognitive competences between
              | adults with low (less than upper secondary) and intermediate (upper secondary or
              | non-tertiary post-secondary) levels of educational attainment. The “upper skills
              | gap” is defined as the difference between adults with intermediate and high (ter-
              | tiary) levels of education.
              | Our basic assumption is that educational stratification processes sort individ-
              | uals into different learning environments and thereby define opportunities to
              | acquire educational degrees and (different types of) competences or skills. Corre-
              | spondingly, one would expect that in more stratified systems formal certificates
              | tend to be more closely related to (specific types of) skills. Plausible mechanisms
              | through which more stratified systems strengthen the link between formal quali-
              | fications and skills include selection on the basis of pre-existing differences in
              | competences (allocation), reinforcement of pre-existing differences due to the al-
              | location of better-performing students to more favorable learning environments
              | (socialization), and/or greater between-program (and hence between-student) dif-
              | ferences in the types of skills that are emphasized (socialization and allocation).
              | Before we elaborate on these issues, we need to say a few words about the
              | types of skills measured in PIAAC. In all countries, respondents were assessed with
              | respect of two types of “key information-processing skills” (OECD 2013:3): literacy
              | (reading and text comprehension) and numeracy (applied numeric and mathemat-
              | ical skills).1 These skills are undoubtedly important, but it is important to be clear
              | about what they are and what not. The literacy and numeracy skills assessed in
              | PIAAC are probably best described as basic (as opposed to advanced) and general
              | (as opposed to specific). The focus in the literacy domain was on the comprehen-
              | sion of (short) pieces of text (such as instructions or newspaper articles) that citi-
              | zens of economically advanced societies might encounter in everyday life, inside
              | and outside of work. It was not on understanding (or writing) research articles or
              | other long and complex documents. In the numeracy domain, the focus similarly
              | was on everyday tasks involving numerical operations such as correctly inter-
              | preting bar charts that might appear in newspaper articles or government bro-
              | chures. It was not on solving problems that require knowledge of inferential sta-
              | tistics or calculus.
              | Even though it is likely that the skills measured in PIAAC are to some extent
              | correlated with more advanced competences, the latter were not directly tested
              | (see Section 3). As we discuss below, this may limit our ability to ascertain compe-
              | 1 A third domain, “problem solving in technology rich environments”, is unfortunately only avail-
              | able for a subset of countries and only for respondents who took the assessment on a computer
              | (OECD 2013).
              | – 3 –
              | tence differentials in the upper part of the educational distribution, where we
              | would expect to see differences primarily with respect to advanced skills. In addi-
              | tion, the skills assessed in PIAAC are general (or transferable) in the sense that
              | they are likely to be useful in a large variety of work- and non-work settings. Oc-
              | cupation-specific skills (e.g., knowing the functioning of a car engine or certain
              | programming languages), which are useful only in a much smaller set of specific
              | occupations (and therefore emphasized by the respective training programs), were
              | not measured. In the following discussion of how educational stratification condi-
              | tions the link between formal qualification and skills, we will primarily focus on
              | the relationship between qualifications and basic general skills as they are meas-
              | ured in PIAAC—because this is the relationship that we can ascertain empirically.
              | Nevertheless, the (unobserved) types of skill (advanced and occupation-specific)
              | also play a crucial part in our argument.
              | Returning to educational stratification processes, we begin with vertical strati-
              | fication, by which we mean sorting by performance (ability) into different educa-
              | tional environments. A well-known form of vertical stratification is external dif-
              | ferentiation via (ability) tracking. A broad definition of vertical stratification in
              | terms of “performance-segregated learning environments” directs attention to
              | vertical stratification occurring through processes other than explicit tracking.
              | Explicit tracking (or “external differentiation”) in lower secondary education cer-
              | tainly is an important source of vertical stratification, but it is not the only one
              | possible. Residential segregation by family background—in combination with res-
              | idence-based allocation to schools—might result in high levels of vertical stratifi-
              | cation even in a system where children are not explicitly sorted into different
              | academic tracks (cf. Kerckhoff 1995:327). The US is a good example: It has a com-
              | prehensive school system with little external differentiation, but due to (socioeco-
              | nomic) residential segregation nevertheless an intermediate degree of vertical
              | stratification—in the sense that there is considerable between-school variation in
              | average student performance, that is, high and low-performing students tend to
              | cluster in different schools. In the US-American case, a decentralized funding sys-
              | tem may further raise the consequences of this clustering for skills acquisition:
              | Because they tend to be located in less affluent neighborhoods, schools with low-
              | er-performing students will typically have fewer resources (Park and Kyei
              | 2011:883). Other countries that differ noticeably in the degrees of school-level
              | segregation by student performance (“performance sorting”) and “external differ-
              | entiation” are Italy, Japan, and the UK (cf. Appendix Table A2).
              | A first reason for expecting vertical stratification—school-level segregation
              | by performance—to be associated with differences in skills gaps is that segregat-
              | ed learning environments may reinforce preexisting differences in competences:
              | Literature on the so-called reflected-glory (or assimilation) effect suggests that
              | lower-performing students’ motivation and learning processes benefit from
              | classmates with higher levels of proficiency (e.g., Cialdini and Richardson 1980;
              | Snyder, Lassegard, and Ford 1986). In more stratified systems, low-ability students
              | are deprived of such positive stimulation—when it comes to imparting basic cog-
              | nitive competences in literacy and numeracy. This reflected-glory effect might be
              | – 4 –
              | reinforced by larger differences in the aspiration levels of curricula and teacher’s
              | expectations and aspirations in more vertically stratified systems.
              | A second mechanism through which vertical stratification might affect skills
              | gaps by educational attainment is selection. In countries with tracked systems,
              | low-performing students likely face greater difficulties in gaining access to pro-
              | grams leading to higher educational degrees. Thus, at one and the same education-
              | al level, there should be smaller within-group heterogeneity with respect to
              | preexisting differences in performance or ability. In particular, higher degrees of
              | vertical stratification in lower secondary education might raise the probability
              | that individuals with low initial levels of basic competences do not transition to or
              | complete upper secondary education, thus ending up in the group with low formal
              | qualifications. Conversely, in more inclusive systems, more of these individuals
              | would presumably be found among the intermediate educated, lowering the mean
              | competence level of this group—and thus the gap in basic competences between
              | the individuals with low and intermediate levels of formal qualifications. By the
              | same token, that is, because of selection processes that exclude low-performing
              | students from gaining access to programs at the upper secondary level, one might
              | expect skills gaps between intermediate and higher educated adults to be small(er)
              | in countries with higher degrees of vertical stratification.
              | To sum up, if selection processes based on ability and/or reflected-glory-type
              | processes are important, then higher degrees of vertical stratification lead to a
              | situation where initial cognitive competences influence access to more favorable
              | educational environments, that is, to a mutually reinforcing process of compe-
              | tence-based selection into less or more favorable learning environments. Given
              | the expected negative consequences of vertical stratification for low-performing
              | students, it is plausible to assume that vertical stratification primarily affects the
              | relationship between certificates and competences in the lower part of a country’s
              | educational distribution. Differences in basic cognitive competences between less
              | and intermediate educated individuals should be most strongly influenced by se-
              | lection and different learning opportunities: Low-performing students end up in
              | less stimulating learning environments in terms of enhancing their basic cogni-
              | tive competences.
              | As for country-level variation in skills gaps, we therefore hypothesize that the
              | gap in basic competences between less and intermediate educated adults rises
              | with a country’s level of vertical stratification in lower secondary education (hy-
              | pothesis 1a). In contrast, according to the reflected-glory effect, individuals with
              | intermediate and high educational degrees should be exposed to more stimulating
              | schools or school tracks—and thus to learning environments that are more simi-
              | lar with respect to preserving and enhancing basic (as opposed to advanced) gen-
              | eral competences. For the gap between intermediate and higher educated adults,
              | we would therefore expect to find no effect of vertical stratification. If anything,
              | we would expect to see smaller skills gaps in countries with higher degrees of verti-
              | cal stratification of lower secondary education, because of a selection effect (i.e.,
              | individuals with low competences are more effectively excluded from entering edu-
              | cational programs that lead to intermediate formal qualifications) (hypothesis 1b).
              | – 5 –
              | These hypotheses and especially hypothesis 1a are based on the assumption
              | that reflected-glory type processes predominate. There also exists a literature on
              | the so-called big-fish-little-pond effect (Marsh 1987), which argues opposite to the
              | reflected-glory effect. According to this explanation, the self-concept, motivation,
              | and ultimately performance level of lower-ability students are negatively affected
              | by peers with higher levels of proficiency. An implication of this effect is that
              | low-ability students would be better off in terms of motivation and learning in
              | more stratified school systems. In addition, teachers might be better able to tailor
              | their teaching to the needs of students if the latter are more homogeneous. These
              | arguments would suggest that hypothesis 1a will be falsified: The gap in basic
              | competences between less and intermediate educated adults should decrease with
              | a country’s level of vertical stratification in lower secondary education. In terms
              | of hypothesis 1b, only the selection effect would than apply, that is we would find
              | lower skills gaps in more stratified countries.
              | The second dimension of educational stratification that likely affects skills
              | gaps is horizontal: the degree of occupation specificity of upper secondary education.
              | This feature is related to the question of what is learned in different tracks (at the
              | same educational level): whether a country’s system of upper secondary education
              | puts greater emphasis on general or occupational/vocational skills. In more occu-
              | pation-specific education systems, curricula and attention are directed more to-
              | wards vocational than general skills (cf. Hanushek, Woessmann, and Zhang 2011;
              | OECD 2010:59-60; OECD 2013:200-2; Shavit and Müller 2000).
              | We cannot directly explore the relationship between general competences, oc-
              | cupation-specific skills, and educational certificates with PIAAC (because occupa-
              | tion-specific skills were not measured). But it is plausible to assume that greater
              | emphasis on occupation-specific skills in (upper) secondary education draws some
              | resources (e.g., teaching and learning time) away from the acquisition of general
              | cognitive skills. Thus, more of the learning time of intermediate-educated adults
              | is devoted to acquiring occupation-specific skills rather than basic competences in
              | countries with greater occupation-specificity. This is particularly true for coun-
              | tries with apprenticeship systems, like Germany or Austria: “In many apprentice-
              | ships, there is a rather small element of numeracy and literacy skills as part of the
              | (typically) one or one and a half days a week part-time school element in the dual
              | system.” (OECD 2010:60)
              | In addition, occupation-specific upper secondary education systems are a con-
              | stitutive part of occupational labor markets (Marsden 1990; Hall and Soskice
              | 2011)—meaning that in these countries adults with vocational upper secondary
              | education have rather good labor market opportunities in terms of occupying
              | skilled position, while in general upper secondary education systems school leav-
              | ers need to continue and finish tertiary education as a “safety net” to avoid un-
              | skilled jobs (Shavit and Müller 2000). Hence, in the latter countries, more adults
              | attend college or university education than in occupational labor markets. This is
              | evident in a rather high correlation between degree of occupation-specificity of
              | upper secondary education system (Appendix Table A2) and the proportion of ter-
              | tiary educated adults (Appendix Table A1) of -0.65. This suggests that entry into
              | – 6 –
              | tertiary education is more selective with respect to preexisting differences in per-
              | formance or ability in occupation-specific countries—and less selective in gen-
              | eral-education countries.
              | Given these two mechanisms—learning time devoted to general competences
              | in upper secondary education and selection into tertiary education—, occupation-
              | specificity in upper secondary education might again differently affect the size of
              | the lower and the upper skills gap. For the skills gap (in basic general competenc-
              | es) between less and intermediate-educated adults, we expect to find smaller gaps
              | in countries with higher degrees of occupation-specificity of upper secondary ed-
              | ucation—because the intermediate group devoted a substantial portion of their
              | learning time in upper secondary education to acquiring occupational rather than
              | general skills (hypothesis 2a). As for the upper skills gap—that is, the gap between
              | intermediate and higher educated adults—, we would expect it to be larger in
              | countries with higher degrees of occupational specificity (hypothesis 2b). Again,
              | this is partly because the intermediate group in more occupation-specific coun-
              | tries more heavily invested in occupation-specific skills. Yet it is also because of
              | country differences in the selectivity of attending higher education: In occupa-
              | tion-specific countries, where vocational training programs at the upper second-
              | ary level provide a good alternative, those who decide to attend higher education
              | should be a more selective, academically inclined group than in general systems.
              | One might suggest that we more directly test our assumption about the impact
              | of attending a vocational program in upper secondary education, namely by com-
              | paring skills gaps between adults with vocational and general upper secondary
              | education. This is, however, not a convincing approach. The PIAAC data provide
              | only information on the highest educational degree completed. Hence those with
              | general (as opposed to vocational) upper secondary education do not comprise all
              | individuals who ever attended general programs at the upper secondary level:
              | They rather are a selective group that did not continue with tertiary education. In
              | this paper, we therefore rely on our indirect hypotheses and take their verifica-
              | tion/falsification as a signal (proxy) of “theoretical constructs that provide hypo-
              | thetical links between observable events,” although they cannot can be (directly)
              | observed (Hedström and Swedberg 1996:290).
              | The two institutional characteristics of education systems—vertical stratifica-
              | tion and horizontal stratification in terms of occupation-specificity—co-exist in
              | different combinations and in some countries their effects may cancel each other
              | out. We expect the lower skills gaps to be smaller in more occupation-specific and
              | to be larger in more stratifying education systems—and vice versa for the upper
              | skills gap. Some well-known examples combine both a high degree of occupation-
              | specificity and of vertical stratification (like Austria or Germany), or both a low
              | degree of occupation-specificity and of vertical stratification (like Canada). If this
              | relationship (i.e., of a positive relationship between occupational specificity and
              | vertical stratification) holds more generally (which, as we show in Section 3, it
              | does), then the expected effects of occupational specificity and vertical stratifica-
              | tion should be stronger when both characteristics are included simultaneously in
              | the regression.

              | Data and Methods
              | Data and sample
              | For our empirical analysis, we use data from the first round of the Programme for
              | the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (OECD 2013). Data collection took
              | place in 2011/2012 in a total of 24 countries. All samples are probability samples
              | of the 16 to 65 year old population, with a minimum sample size of 5,000 and a
              | total sample size of approximately 160,000 cases. Our analysis is based on the
              | public use files that are available on the OECD’s PIAAC webpage.2
              | We include 21 of the 24 participating countries. We exclude Cyprus because of
              | a very high share of “literacy-related non-respondents” of 17.1 percent (for more
              | details, see below), Russia because of concerns about data quality, and Australia
              | because it does not provide a public use file. “Belgium” is included but PIAAC was
              | only conducted in the region of Flanders.
              | PIAAC provides internationally comparable information on educational certifi-
              | cates based on the 2011 revision of the International Standard Classification of
              | Education (ISCED). We distinguish between low (ISCED 0-2), intermediate (ISCED 3-
              | 4) and high (ISCED 5-6) education—roughly equivalent to having completed less
              | than upper secondary, upper secondary or (non-tertiary) post-secondary, and ter-
              | tiary education, respectively.
              | The unique feature of PIAAC is that it provides high-quality data on basic cog-
              | nitive competences or “key information-processing skills” (OECD 2013). All coun-
              | tries mandatorily administered test items to assess respondents’ reading and text
              | comprehension skills (literacy) and practical mathematical skills (numeracy). A
              | third skill domain, problem solving in technology-rich environments, was optional
              | and is therefore not available for all countries. Literacy and numeracy scores are
              | very highly correlated. For example, the country-level correlation between the
              | low-intermediate numeracy and literacy gaps (adjusted for key individual-level
              | characteristics, see below) is 0.95 in our sample. Results for literacy and numeracy
              | gaps therefore tend to be very similar and we only present results for numeracy
              | gaps in the paper.
              | The PIAAC data are of much higher quality than the first large-scale interna-
              | tional survey of adult competences, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS),
              | which was conducted in the mid-1990s. First, the quality of competence measure-
              | ments has advanced considerably since the mid-1990s, partly due to the advances
              | spawned by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Second, in
              | IALS information on educational certificates was incorrect for four countries
              | (Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and the UK). These misclassifications can be re-
              | mediated based on information available in the IALS data (for details see
              | Gesthuizen, Solga, and Künster 2011). Unfortunately, the erroneous education var-
              | 2 We use the updated public use files that were released on November 7, 2013, approximately one
              | month after the initial release (http://www.oecd.org/site/piaac/publicdataandanalysis.htm).
              | – 8 –
              | iables also lead to problems with the IALS competence scores that cannot be fixed:
              | To limit respondent burden, IALS—like other large-scale assessments such as
              | PISA, TIMSS, and also PIAAC—administered only a relatively small number of test
              | items to each interviewee. These items on their own are insufficient for con-
              | structing accurate competence scores. Respondents were therefore assigned a set
              | of (multiply imputed) “plausible values” on the basis of test performance and
              | background characteristics. These background variables comprise various educa-
              | tion measures and in the case of IALS presumably included the erroneous qualifi-
              | cations variable (detailed information on the imputation procedure are no longer
              | available, but see Kirsch, 2001:31, for further useful information).
              | Our sample is restricted to respondents who were 25 to 54 years old in 2011,
              | that is, to birth cohorts 1957 to 1987. These respondents had mostly left education
              | in 2011 and went to secondary school between the 1960s and early 2000s—thus
              | after post-war educational expansion in most countries. We exclude respondents
              | who obtained their highest degree in a foreign country because their degrees and
              | competences cannot be considered as results of the education system of their cur-
              | rent country of residence.
              | Some respondents sampled by PIAAC were not administered the full interview
              | because of insufficient proficiency in the interview language (the most common
              | reason), reading or writing difficulties, or learning or mental disabilities. For
              | these so-called “literacy-related non-respondents” (LRNR) only information on
              | gender and age is available. Excluding them from the analysis could bias our re-
              | sults, because their share differs considerably across countries. In our sample, the
              | proportion of LRNR ranges from zero percent to 3.8 percent in the US and 4.8 per-
              | cent in Belgium (see Appendix Table A1). Most LRNR likely have low levels of basic
              | competences and formal education. Even though country differences in the pro-
              | portion of LRNR may seem small, this group can be quite large in relation to the
              | group of less educated adults (ISCED 0-2). Excluding them could thus be quite con-
              | sequential when, as in this paper, less educated adults (or their difference to in-
              | termediate educated adults) are of particular interest. Our analysis therefore in-
              | cludes LRNR (in contrast to the study of Park and Kyei 2011, because this is not
              | possible with the IALS data). For doing so, we had to assign LRNR respondents val-
              | ues on all variables other than gender and age. We proceeded as follows. First we
              | assigned a (very low) numeracy score of 85 to LRNR. This is the value used by the
              | OECD (2013:69) in robustness checks that explore the impact of including LRNR on
              | country differences in average competence scores. Using these assumed compe-
              | tence scores and information on age and gender, we then obtained 10 imputations
              | of all other variables relevant to our analysis, including highest educational de-
              | gree (see below). Including LRNR substantially raises the share of the less-
              | educated group in some countries, for example, from about 10.2 to 13.0 percent in
              | the US and from 11.5 to 15.1 percent in Belgium.
              | Overall, the PIAAC data for the 21 countries in our analysis include a total of
              | 88,818 observations who meet our age restriction. We exclude 3,538 cases who
              | obtained their highest degree in a foreign country and another 30 cases for whom
              | this information is missing although they do not belong to the group of literacy-
              | – 9 –
              | related non-respondents. We exclude another 168 cases that are not LRNR, but
              | have missing information on at least one of the variables included in the analysis.
              | Our final sample comprises 83,999 “regular” respondents with complete infor-
              | mation and 1,079 literacy related non-respondents.3
              | Methods and variables
              | Our data have a two-level structure: We study respondents who are nested within
              | countries. We analyze these data using a two-step procedure. In a first step, we
              | estimate the two numeracy gaps for each of the 21 countries in our sample, con-
              | trolling for key individual characteristics (see below). In a second step, we then
              | regress the estimated numeracy gaps on our focal variables—different measures
              | of vertical stratification and occupation-specificity—and additional country-level
              | control variables (see below). These country-level regressions are estimated using
              | weighted least squares (WLS). WLS is used to increase efficiency by incorporating
              | information on the uncertainty of the numeracy gap estimates (as contained in
              | the standard errors of the estimated numeracy gaps; for further details on this
              | two-step approach, see Lewis and Linzer 2005). We report heteroscedasticity-
              | consistent standard errors to safeguard against any remaining heteroscedasticity.
              | As a sensitivity analysis, we also carried out the two-step procedure with ordinary
              | least squares at the country level and the results were very similar (results are
              | available on request).
              | This two-step approach is an alternative to simultaneous estimation via (re-
              | stricted) maximum likelihood, often referred to as hierarchical or multilevel mod-
              | eling. We opted for the two-step approach because it does not impose strong as-
              | sumptions on the distribution of the country-level error terms and allows the ef-
              | fects of control variables to vary across countries (Achen 2005). Our approach also
              | facilitates inspection of country-specific estimates and thus the detection of sub-
              | stantively interesting cases and/or outliers, which are readily overlooked with
              | simultaneous estimation and important to consider especially in country compari-
              | sons consisting of less than 30 or even 50 cases (Bryan and Jenkins 2013).4 De-
              | scriptive information for all individual and country level variables is displayed in
              | Appendix Tables A1 and A2.
              | 3 Consistent with our analysis of non-LRNR, we exclude LRNR from the analysis of a given imputa-
              | tion if the variable “foreign degree” takes the value “true” for that imputation. The set of LRNR
              | cases included in the analysis thus differs slightly across imputations. Four LRNR are excluded
              | completely because they were imputed as having a foreign degree in all 10 imputations.
              | 4 There is a shortage of systematic comparisons between these different approaches in country-
              | comparative settings. It is clear on analytic grounds that simultaneous estimation will be more
              | efficient than the two-step approach when the data come reasonably close to meeting the strong-
              | er assumptions of the former approach (e.g., normality of cluster-level error terms)—but it is not
              | clear how close “reasonably close” is. The efficiency gains are probably modest when the number
              | of individual observations per cluster is relatively large so that cluster-specific parameter esti-
              | mates are relatively precise (Lewis and Linzer 2005). This is the case in our application, as it is in
              | most applications where the higher-level units are countries (as opposed to, for instance, schools
              | or classrooms). Recent studies using the two-step method are Gebel and Giesecke (2011) and
              | Heisig (2011).

              | Our individual-level regressions adjust mean numeracy differences between
              | educational groups (our two skills gaps) for differences in the following variables:
              | age (5-year groups), gender, being below age 30 and in formal education (to ac-
              | count for country differences in the typical age of completing vocational and ter-
              | tiary education), and foreign-birth/foreign-language status (to control for country
              | variation in the migrant population) (see Appendix Table A1). The latter variable
              | has four categories indicating whether a respondent was born in the country
              | where she took the test and/or whether her primary language was that of the test
              | language or another language. We exclude adults with high levels of education
              | from the estimation of the lower skills gap and adults with low levels of education
              | from the estimation of the upper skills gap. The effects of these compositional
              | variables are thus allowed to differ across the educational distribution.
              | As noted above, to limit respondent burden, PIAAC administered only a rela-
              | tively small number of test items to each individual. Individual competence scores
              | are therefore quite uncertain. To account for this uncertainty, PIAAC provides 10
              | so-called plausible values rather than a unique competence score for each re-
              | spondent, much like multiple imputation uses multiple imputations to account for
              | imputation uncertainty. PIAAC also provides jackknife replicate weights (80 for
              | most countries) to adjust variance estimates for the different complex survey de-
              | signs of participating countries. We also took these weights into account, meaning
              | that the estimated numeracy gaps and associated standard errors are based on up
              | to 800 regressions per country (80 jackknife weights—or the number of available
              | weights—times 10 plausible values). All estimations were carried out in Stata 13.
              | We now describe the macro-level variables used in the country-level regres-
              | sions. For vertical stratification in secondary education, the prevailing practice is
              | to focus on external differentiation via tracking (i.e., the existence of different
              | school types). Bol and Van de Werfhorst’s (2013) Educational Systems Data Set (ver-
              | sion 4) provides an index of external differentiation that is based on the age of first
              | selection into different tracks (with lower ages corresponding to greater external
              | differentiation), the number of tracks available at age 15, and the length of
              | tracked education as a proportion of the total duration of primary and secondary
              | education. We will also use this variable in the present study.
              | What this measure may fail to capture, however, is that segregation according
              | to student performance may occur through processes other than explicit tracking,
              | for instance, because of residential segregation. To capture such processes, we
              | need a measure that is sensitive to school-level differences in (average) student
              | performance within the same track. Such a measure is given by the proportion of
              | total variance in student performance that is attributable to between-school dif-
              | ferences, which the OECD regularly publishes in its PISA reports. More recent pub-
              | lications often report its inverse (i.e., 1 minus the proportion of overall perfor-
              | mance variance), which the OECD also refers to as the “index of vertical inclusion.”
              | In these cases we simply inverted the measure again so that higher values con-
              | sistently correspond to higher levels of vertical stratification. In order to reduce
              | measurement error, we averaged all available estimates from the 2000, 2003,
              | 2006, and 2009 PISA studies (i.e., we averaged estimates for different years and for
              | – 11 –
              | different domains such as reading, mathematics, and science) (OECD 2004, 2005,
              | 2007, 2011). We call this indicator of vertical stratification performance sorting
              | index.
              | We use two different measures of horizontal stratification in terms of occupa-
              | tion-specificity. Previous research (e.g., Bol and Van de Werfhorst 2011; Van de
              | Werfhorst 2011) has often used the proportion of students in upper secondary ed-
              | ucation who are in a vocational program (tracks). We also use this “vocational ori-
              | entation index” (again obtained from version 4 of the Educational Systems Data Set
              | by Bol and Van de Werfhorst, 2013). We cannot compute this index from the PIAAC
              | data, because information on vocational education is subject to high proportions
              | of missing data in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the
              | United States.
              | There also exists a large literature that captures occupation-specificity using a
              | fourfold typology of systems of upper secondary education: apprenticeship systems,
              | mixed systems, school-based vocational systems, and general systems (cf. Europe-
              | an Centre for the Development of Vocational Training 2013; Müller 1994; OECD
              | 2000). The first three types can be characterized as occupation-specific, but differ
              | in the strength of employer involvement in the development of curricula, time for
              | firm-based training, and the standardization of vocational certificates. The degree
              | of occupation-specificity is generally supposed to be largest in apprenticeship
              | countries and smallest in countries with general upper secondary education sys-
              | tems. This classification suggests a different order of countries than the share of
              | students in vocational tracks (see Table A2 in the Appendix). For example, the
              | Czech Republic and the Netherlands have higher shares of vocational education
              | enrolment than Germany or Denmark. Based on the vocational orientation index,
              | the Czech Republic and the Netherlands—two countries with mixed systems—
              | would thus be considered as being more occupation-specific than the apprentice-
              | ship countries Germany or Denmark. We will use both indicators of occupation-
              | specificity in our analysis as robustness check.
              | Figure 1 displays the two measurements of vertical stratification and their re-
              | lationship to the vocational orientation index. Two points are noteworthy. First,
              | while both measures of vertical stratification are positively related to vocational
              | orientation index, the relationship is stronger for external differentiation (Sub-
              | graph II) than for performance sorting (Subgraph I). This reflects the obvious fact
              | that external differentiation grasps tracking in lower and upper secondary educa-
              | tion and that some tracking is a necessary condition for having vocational tracks
              | in upper secondary education. Second, the positive relationship between the two
              | indicators of vertical stratification and the vocational orientation index suggests
              | that in many countries, the two institutional characteristics partly cancel each
              | other out when it comes to the size of the low-intermediate skills gaps. This sup-
              | ports the idea that evidence for hypotheses 1a and 2a should be stronger when
              | including indicators of both characteristics simultaneously in the country-level
              | regression.

              | Country-level control variables
              | We also present specifications that include a set of country-level control variables.
              | As discussed above, Park and Kyei (2011) found that greater between-school ine-
              | quality of instructional resources is associated with greater literacy gaps between
              | less and intermediate educated adults. We will also include this factor in our coun-
              | try-level regressions. The underlying measurement of school’s instructional ca-
              | pacity is based on information collected through the Grade 8 school principal
              | questionnaires of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).
              | School principals indicated to what extent (4-point scale) their school’s capacity to
              | provide instruction was affected by shortages or inadequacies in 17 different do-
              | mains. Following Park and Kyei (2011), we averaged principals’ responses to these
              | 17 items to obtain a measure of school resources and then computed the school-
              | level Theil index to capture inequality. We constructed this measure for the 1995,
              | 1999, 2003, and 2007 TIMSS and averaged all available values for a given country
              | in order to reduce measurement error. Further information on the TIMSS studies
              | is available on at http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/. Column 10 in Appendix Table A2
              | reports the values of the Theil index for our country sample. The Pearson correla-
              | – 13 –
              | tion between our measure and the corresponding measure reported by Park and
              | Kyei (2011) is 0.84 for the 13 countries that are included in both studies.
              | We include two further control variables that were constructed from the PIAAC
              | data. One is the proportion of 25-to-54-year-olds who were born in a foreign
              | country and/or whose primary language is not that of the PIAAC test. As noted
              | above, we control for foreign-birth/foreign-language status at the individual lev-
              | el. We additionally include the population share of adults to account for the possi-
              | bility that countries with larger foreign-born/foreign-language populations may
              | have higher levels of “ethnic” segregation at the school level (which would pre-
              | sumably result in larger skills gaps).
              | Finally, skills gaps among adults with different levels of education might part-
              | ly arise from different participation rates in further training after leaving full-
              | time education. Post-schooling opportunities may renew or enhance adult generic
              | skills. Park and Kyei (2011:898) found that skills gaps are smaller in countries that
              | provide more equal further education opportunities for adults with different
              | school attainment (Park and Kyei 2011:898). We therefore control for the percent-
              | age point difference in continuing education and training participation among 25-
              | to-54-year-olds. For obvious reasons, the difference is calculated between adults
              | with ISCED 3-4 vs. 0-2 in the models of the lower and between ISCED 5-6 vs. 3-4 in
              | the models of the upper skills gap.
              | Missing values
              | In a few cases, information on country-level variables is missing. The data set by
              | Bol and Van de Werfhorst (2013) does not provide an external differentiation score
              | for Estonia. The performance sorting measure is missing for France and the meas-
              | ure of school-level resource inequality for France and Poland. Finally, the point
              | difference in further training could not be estimated for Austria, because the vari-
              | able on participation in further training is not included in the Austrian PIAAC
              | public use file. We used multiple imputation at the country level (10 imputations
              | using predictive mean matching) to predict these missing values.

              | Findings
              | We start with descriptive findings on country variation in the mean numeracy
              | proficiency of educational groups and then continue by testing our hypotheses for
              | the lower and the upper skills gaps, respectively.
              | Country variation in mean numeracy by educational degree
              | Figure 2 depicts the mean numeracy levels achieved by adults with different lev-
              | els of educational attainment (see also Appendix Table A2). In all countries, the
              | mean numeracy score is lower for less educated adults than for those with inter-
              | mediate levels of education, who in turn have lower means than those with col-
              | lege education. Thus, unsurprisingly, in all countries we find a positive relation-
              | ship between basic cognitive competences and certificates. Moreover, country var-
              | iation in the mean numeracy level of all educational groups is quite substantial. It
              | is largest for less educated adults (ISCED 0-2), followed by the country differences
              | of intermediate (ISCED 3-4) and then higher (ISCED 5-6) educated adults.

              | The mean competence level of less-educated adults is lowest in the US (162.6) and
              | highest in Finland (260.8). This difference corresponds to almost two competence
              | levels: The PIAAC framework distinguishes among six competence levels (below
              | level 1 to level 5)—with the intermediate levels 2-4 each spanning a range of 50
              | points (OECD 2013:76). Another benchmark for putting these differences in per-
              | spective is the standard deviation of numeracy scores for the full PIAAC sample
              | (i.e., adults aged 16 to 65 from all participating countries), which is 51.3 points
              | (OECD 2013:266).
              | Country variation in the mean numeracy levels of intermediate educated
              | adults (ISCED 3-4) ranges from 239.5 points in the US to 284.2 points in the Neth-
              | erlands. This still amounts to about 45 points. Country differences in the average
              | score of higher educated adults (ISCED 5-6) are again smaller, but remain quite
              | substantial—ranging from 280.2 in Spain to 314.3 in Belgium (about 34 points).
              | To what extent these differences “translate” into country differences in skills
              | gaps, and whether educational stratification processes influence the size of these
              | gaps, will be investigated in the following.
              | Low-intermediate numeracy gaps
              | Figure 3 shows the results of our first step, that is, of the individual-level regres-
              | sions of the low-intermediate numeracy gap for each of the 21 countries.

              | The figure displays the raw (unadjusted) and adjusted numeracy gaps between
              | adults with low and intermediate levels of education (ISCED 0-2 vs. 3-4). Adjusted
              | numeracy gaps are controlled for age, gender, an indicator for being below age 30
              | and (still) in formal education, and foreign-birth/foreign language status.
              | The unadjusted lower numeracy gap varies from only 19.8 points in Finland to
              | 76.9 points in the United States, a range of about 57 points. The adjusted lower
              | numeracy gap reaches a low of 14.2 points in Finland and a high of 57.0 points in
              | the Slovak Republic, a range of 42.8 points. This is still substantial, yet noticeably
              | smaller than for the raw gap, implying that compositional differences in the above
              | mentioned individual characteristics account for a good portion of country varia-
              | tion in the lower skills gap.
              | In order to test hypotheses 1a and 2a, we now turn to the second step: the
              | country-level regressions of adjusted numeracy gaps. We provide two tables: Table
              | 1 presents results without further country-level controls and Table 2 presents
              | results with the controls included. We start with the results without controls,
              | which are displayed in Table 1. All continuous predictors (i.e., all except the typol-
              | ogy of upper secondary education systems) are standardized to have a mean of
              | zero and standard deviation of one, so the point estimates can be interpreted as
              | the expected increase in the lower numeracy gap for a standard deviation increase
              | in the respective predictor.
              | Models M1 – M4 show that without including indicators of both dimensions of
              | stratification simultaneously in the regression, only the performance sorting in-
              | dex as one of the two indicators of vertical stratification is significant—and, as
              | expected, higher levels of performance sorting are associated with a larger lower
              | skills gap (model M1). The external differentiation index also has a sizable effect in
              | the expected direction, but is less precisely estimated. Coefficient estimates for
              | the two measures of occupational specificity generally have the expected sign, but
              | are relatively small and far from reaching statistical significance (the sole excep-
              | tion is the difference between general system and vocational schools system
              | countries in model M4).
              | Yet, given that occupation-specificity and vertical stratification are positively
              | correlated (see Figure 1 in Section 3) and presumably have opposite effects on the
              | lower skills gap, the expected effects might begin to show or become reinforced
              | once we include measures of both dimensions in the regression. Models M5 to M8
              | in Table 1 confirm this expectation. These models include indicators of both insti-
              | tutional characteristics simultaneously, but differ in the combination of indicators
              | included.
              | The models reveal that when controlling for occupation-specificity (regardless
              | of which of the two indicators is used), both the performance sorting and the ex-
              | ternal differentiation index are significant and go in the expected direction: The
              | lower numeracy gap is larger in countries with higher sorting education systems
              | and the effect sizes are substantial: According to the estimates displayed in model
              | M5 (and M6), a standard deviation increase in performance sorting is associated
              | with a 6.2 (or 4.8) point increase in the lower numeracy gap, when occupation-
              | specificity is controlled via the vocational orientation index (or via the typology of
              | – 17 –
              | upper secondary education systems). The corresponding estimates for a standard
              | deviation increase in the external differentiation index are 8.4 (or 5.4) points (M7
              | and M8). These results support hypothesis 1a.

              | Turning to occupation-specificity, we only find a significant effect in model M7 in
              | Table 1—that is only for the vocational orientation index and only in combination
              | with the external differentiation index. The effect of vocational orientation is neg-
              | ative, as expected: The more upper secondary education emphasizes occupation-
              | specific skills, the smaller is the low-intermediate numeracy gap. This result con-
              | firms our hypothesis 2a. There is less support for the second measurement of oc-
              | cupation-specificity “types of upper secondary education systems,” at least if con-
              | – 18 –
              | ventional standards of statistical significance are applied. The indicators for the
              | different systems are insignificant in all specifications. The directions of the ef-
              | fects are mostly as expected, suggesting that the low-intermediate numeracy gap
              | is larger in countries with a general system (the reference category) than in coun-
              | tries with an apprenticeship system or vocational schools. The effect of “mixed
              | systems” is “wrongly” (i.e., positively) signed in some specification, but tends to be
              | very small.
              | Before we move on to the regression results including our control variables,
              | model M9 displays estimation results for the Theil index on between-school dif-
              | ferences in instructional resources. In contrast to the findings of Park and Kyei
              | (2011), the effect size is small (1.7) and not statistically significant (standard error
              | 2.32). The picture does not change substantially if we more closely follow Park and
              | Kyei and look at literacy (rather than numeracy) gaps or and/restrict the analysis
              | to the age range 25-34 (Park and Kyei’s study was restricted to ages 26-35, which
              | we cannot replicate exactly because the PIAAC data only provide five-year age
              | groups; these results are available upon request). Thus, with an improved meas-
              | urement of basic competences (in PIAAC) and a different country sample, their
              | finding cannot be replicated.
              | Table 2 summarizes the same basic specifications as Table 1, but this time with
              | additional country-level control variables (between-school inequality, difference
              | in adult training participation, share of foreign-born and/or foreign-language sta-
              | tus). These models yield quite similar results. Both measures of vertical stratifica-
              | tion are significant in models M5 and M7, but no longer attain statistical signifi-
              | cance in models M6 and M8 (where occupation-specificity is captured via the ty-
              | pology). However, the effect sizes in models M6 and M8 are similar to those in Ta-
              | ble 1: The loss of statistical significance is attributable to a loss of precision (larger
              | standard errors) rather than smaller effect sizes (the latter in fact increase). In
              | models M5 and M7 (where occupation-specificity is captured via the vocational
              | orientation index), the effects of the stratification measures are (even) more ro-
              | bust to the inclusion of additional controls. Taken together, these results provide
              | strong support for hypothesis 1a.
              | The vocational orientation index is again only significant in model M7 in Table
              | 2. Coefficient estimates for the typology of upper secondary education systems
              | most clearly show the pattern predicted by hypothesis 2a when the external dif-
              | ferentiation index and the additional country-level control variables are included
              | in the regression (model M8 in Table 2): The smallest skills gap can be found in
              | countries with apprenticeship systems, followed by countries with mixed and vo-
              | cational school systems, while countries with general secondary education sys-
              | tems have, on average, the largest low-intermediate skills gap. On the whole, the
              | empirical evidence for hypothesis 2a is thus somewhat less conclusive than for
              | hypothesis 1a. Overall, however, the results do lend reasonable support to the idea
              | that greater occupation-specificity of upper secondary education is associated
              | with smaller differences in (PIAAC) skills between adults with low and intermedi-
              | ate formal qualifications. As for the role of between-school resource inequality
              | – 19 –
              | (captured by the Theil index), we still find no clear evidence for a positive associa-
              | tion with the lower skills gap.

              | A look at the explained variance Table 1 (models M5 – M8), suggests that the in-
              | cluded stratification characteristics together account for a quite high proportion
              | (between 28 and 41 percent) of the country variation in lower skills gaps. Moreo-

              | country variation in the low-intermediate skills gap and neither is clearly prefer-

              | A first result apparent from Figure 4 (Subgraphs I and II) is that accounting for
              | country differences in occupation-specificity and vertical stratification (perfor-
              | mance sorting or external differentiation index) substantially reduces cross-
              | national variation in the (adjusted) lower numeracy gap. Whereas adjusted lower

              | country data sets (see Section 3).

              | numeracy gaps span a range of 42.8 points (cf. the discussion of Figure 3 above),

              | (filled triangles) span ranges of 32.8 points (vocational orientation and perfor-
              | mance sorting indices, Subgraph I) and 28.4 points (vocational orientation and ex-
              | ternal differentiation indices, Subgraph II).
              | Adding the country-level control variables further reduces the country varia-
              | tion (hollow triangles), to 23.7 points (Subgraph I) and 19.4 points (Subgraph II). A
              | look at Table 2 suggests that this is primarily due to the control variable “percent-
              | age point difference in training participation between adults with low and inter-
              | mediate levels of education”, because this is the control variable that has the larg-
              | est effect. Like Park and Kyei (2011:898), we find that lower numeracy gaps tend to

              | and intermediate educated adults to receive adult education and training.
              | Second, looking at outliers (hollow triangles including the controls), we see
              | that for the performance sorting index, quite large residuals (more than 5 points)
              | can be found for Finland and Korea in negative direction and Poland, France, the
              | Czech and Slovak Republic in positive direction. For the external differentiation
              | index, substantial outliners are also Finland, Korea, Poland, and the Slovak Repub-
              | lic, and differently, Austria, Japan, the UK, and the US. The latter three countries
              | are interesting, because these are countries which show a much lower degree of
              | vertical stratification in terms of external differentiation than of performance
              | sorting. For the majority of country cases the two indicators of vertical stratifica-
              | tion seem to perform similarly well, however.
              | Intermediate-high numeracy gaps
              | We now turn to the upper numeracy gap. Figure 5 plots the (unadjusted and ad-
              | justed) gap between adults with high (ISCED 5-6) and intermediate (ISCED 3-4) lev-
              | els of education. Overall, we find somewhat smaller numeracy gaps than for the
              | lower part of the educational distribution. In contrast to the lower numeracy gap,
              | Figure 5 shows that compositional differences between adults with intermediate
              | and high formal qualifications tend to explain only a small part of the of the upper
              | numeracy gap and therefore also do not account for much of the country differ-
              | ences. The raw and adjusted numeracy gaps are very similar in all countries. The
              | adjusted numeracy gap is smallest in Italy (16.8 points) and highest in the US (51.0
              | points), implying a range of 34.2 points.

              | The results for the impact of educational stratification processes on the interme-
              | diate-high skills gaps can be briefly summarized. They are displayed in Table 3
              | (without control variables) and Table 4 (including the control variables). None of
              | the indicators of occupation-specificity and vertical stratification reaches statisti-
              | cal significance in any specification. Moreover, the effect sizes are much smaller
              | than for the low-intermediate skills gaps. The only substantial difference, alt-
              | hough not significant, can be found for the comparison of apprenticeship systems
              | versus general education systems (models M6 and M8 in Table 4). As expected, the
              | upper skills gap tends to be larger in apprenticeship systems (where the interme-
              | diate group invests heavily in occupation-specific skills and where the tertiary
              | educated presumably are a more selective, academically inclined group). Overall,
              | however, hypothesis 2b, which predicted this pattern to hold more generally, is
              | not confirmed. We also expected vertical stratification to be unrelated to the upper
              | skills gap or even slightly negatively related to the upper skills gap (hypothesis
              | 1b). The coefficient estimates on both measures of vertical stratification (perfor-
              | mance sorting and external differentiation index) are indeed not significant and
              | tend to very small (and negative). This result supports our hypothesis.

              | Although the variation in the (adjusted) intermediate-high numeracy gap is quite
              | substantial (see Figure 5), differences in vertical and horizontal stratification do
              | not contribute much to their explanation. This confirms our argument that it is
              | important, first, to separately investigate the lower and upper parts of the educa-
              | tional distribution and, second, to keep in mind that PIAAC is measuring basic cog-
              | nitive competences.
              | Moreover, as indicated in Table 4, inequality in adult education opportunities
              | (% point difference in adult training participation between ISCED 5-6 vs. 3-4) is
              | much less important for the upper than for the lower skills gaps. A plausible in-
              | terpretation of these results is that adults with at least upper secondary education
              | have mostly acquired the basic cognitive competences measured in PIAAC during

              | Finally, model M9 in Table 3 displays again that between-school inequality in in-
              | structional resources (Park and Kyei’s Theil index) is not significant (the same re-
              | sults are found for literacy). It does seem to be somewhat more strongly related to
              | the upper skills gap in the specifications in Table 4 (which include the other coun-
              | try-level controls and different combinations of the measures of vertical stratifi-
              | cation and occupational specificity): Here, the estimates do suggest that the upper
              | skills gap is lower in countries with higher levels of between-school resource ine-
              | quality in lower secondary education. In two specifications (models M2 and M5)
              | this effect is significant at the ten percent level and model M1 it even reaches sig-
              | nificance at the 5 percent level. Nonetheless, this finding contradicts the results
              | by Park and Kyei (2011), whose results suggest that there is no clear or perhaps a
              | small positive relationship between school-level resource inequality and the up-
              | per skills gap. Further research is needed to reconcile these divergent findings.

              | Conclusions
              | The main goal of our paper was to investigate the importance of educational strat-
              | ification processes for the relationship between certificates and competences, op-
              | erationalized as skills gaps by educational attainment. We have chosen to display
              | the results for numeracy, but the results for literacy are very similar (available
              | upon request). We explored the impact of two aspects of educational stratification:
              | vertical stratification of lower secondary education (sorting by perfor-
              | mance/ability) and occupation-specificity of upper secondary education.
              | Our two-step approach of accounting for country differences in skills gaps by
              | compositional differences (individual-level regressions, first step) and institution-
              | al differences (country-level regressions, second step) revealed interesting differ-
              | ences for the lower and upper part of the educational distribution for each of the
              | two steps.
              | First, whereas a high portion of the country variation in the low-intermediate
              | skills gap could be explained by compositional differences with respect to age,
              | gender, migration/language background, and participation in education (under age
              | 30), this was not the case for country variation in the intermediate-high skills gap.
              | Moreover concerning the impact of educational stratification processes, the
              | results for country variation in the lower skills gaps (between less and intermedi-
              | ate educated adults) confirm our hypotheses: Higher levels of vertical stratifica-
              | tion increase the lower skills gap (hypothesis 1a) and greater horizontal stratifica-
              | tion in terms of occupation-specificity of upper secondary education reduces it
              | (hypothesis 2a). As for the role of vertical stratification (hypothesis 1a), we could
              | not determine to what extent it is due to differences in learning opportunities and
              | to selection on the basis of pre-existing competence/ability. Nevertheless, our re-
              | sults would seem to support the reflected-glory story—which posits a positive
              | effect of more inclusive education systems for low-achieving students—rather
              | than the big-fish-little-pond effect, which assumes a positive effect of ability-
              | sorted educational environments (see Section 2). The confirmation of hypothesis
              | 2a is consistent with the idea that occupation-specific systems devote greater re-
              | sources to the enhancement of occupation-specific skills (especially in upper sec-
              | ondary education). Adults who have completed such programs therefore score
              | lower on the kinds of non-occupational general skills assessed in PIAAC. As pre-
              | dicted, we also found that the effects of our different indicators of vertical and
              | horizontal stratification on the low-intermediate numeracy gap became stronger
              | when both aspects of stratification were included in the regression. Both vertical
              | and horizontal stratification are at work, but their effects partly cancel each other
              | out because they tend to be positively correlated, yet influence the lower skills
              | gap in opposite directions.
              | As for the intermediate-high (upper) skills gap, we found some support for hy-
              | pothesis 1b, which expected no (or, if at all, a negative) impact of vertical stratifi-
              | cation on the upper skills gap. Hypothesis 2b predicted a larger upper skills gap in
              | countries with occupation-specific upper secondary education due to higher selec-
              | – 27 –
              | tion into tertiary education. It was not confirmed. Nevertheless, specifications in-
              | cluding further country-level control variables (Table 4) yielded a sizeable effect
              | for apprenticeship systems compared to other types of upper secondary education
              | system, even though it did not reach conventional significance levels. Given that
              | there are only three apprenticeship countries in the sample (which of course lim-
              | its statistical power), this may be seen as some indication that more occupation-
              | specific and especially in apprenticeship systems are characterized by stronger
              | selectivity of tertiary education attendance, which presumably drives up skills
              | differentials between adults with upper secondary and tertiary education.
              | In sum, our main result is that the lower skills gap can be explained quite well
              | by compositional differences and by differences in educational stratification pro-
              | cesses. Thus, in contrast to the argument by Park and Kyei (2011, see Section 1),
              | stratification processes do account for a substantial part of the variation in the
              | low-intermediate skills gap. As in the study of Park and Kyei (2011), we also found
              | that participation in adult education or, more precisely, the trainings gap between
              | less and intermediate educated adults is related to the lower skills gap.
              | Park and Kyei’s (2011) result that between-school resource inequality is a ma-
              | jor predictor of the lower skills gap received much less support, however. One
              | possible explanation for these divergent findings might be differences in sample
              | restrictions or the type of skills studied. Yet, as mentioned already in Section 3,
              | our results do not change substantially when we mimic Park and Kyei’s study
              | more closely by including only the age group 25-34 and/or focusing on literacy
              | rather than numeracy gaps. Another explanation could be differences in data
              | quality. For example, Park and Kyei (2011) found Germany to have a very small
              | lower skills gap in IALS, whereas in PIAAC the gap in Germany is among the larg-
              | est (cf. Figure 3). We cannot rule out the possibility that these results reflect a
              | genuine trend. However, problems with the IALS data for Germany (and a few oth-
              | er countries) that have only recently become obvious (cf. Section 3) render the
              | validity of the IALS-based estimate dubious and we are inclined to take the PIAAC-
              | based one more seriously. On a more substantive level, it may also be important to
              | recognize that school-level resource inequality is an ambiguous predictor. In par-
              | ticular, resource inequality should be most likely to enhance between-student
              | inequalities if schools with above-average students also tend to have above-
              | average resources. Conversely, if extra resources are targeted at disadvantaged
              | schools or neighborhoods with low-performing students, resource inequality
              | might well have equalizing effects. In other words: the level of school-level re-
              | source inequality per se may be less important than how it is related to school-
              | level student composition. Future research should attempt to develop measures
              | that are capable of differentiating between these scenarios—something we could
              | not do in this paper where the main focus was on educational stratification.
              | As for the upper skills gap between intermediate and tertiary educated adults,
              | none of the indicators of educational stratification had a clear effect and neither
              | had the other country-level (control) variables. At best, we got some hints that
              | stronger selection into tertiary education in countries with apprenticeship sys-
              | tems plays a role. We clearly need further studies that develop and test new ideas
              | – 28 –
              | how education systems shape differences in basic cognitive competences between
              | adults with intermediate and higher degrees of formal qualification.
              | Labor market implications
              | As a last point, we would like to discuss the relevance of our findings for broader
              | discussions about the interpretation of labor market returns to competences and
              | educational certificates. Given the easy availability of competence data from
              | PIAAC, new empirical analyses of the impact of (basic) competences and education-
              | al certificates on labor market outcomes can be expected to mushroom during the
              | next few years. But how should we interpret the effects of skills and certificates
              | that will be revealed in these analyses?
              | A long-standing debate that our analysis speaks to is whether and to what ex-
              | tent the well-documented positive relationship between educational attainment
              | and labor market outcomes such as wages reflects productivity differentials or
              | rents. According to the productivity explanation (emphasized by human capital or
              | signaling theory; Becker 1964; Spence 1973), individuals with higher levels of ed-
              | ucation have better labor market outcomes because they have more job-relevant
              | skills than workers with lower levels of education. By contrast, the rent story ar-
              | gues that educational certificates at least partly serve as devices that artificially
              | restrict access to jobs, thereby ensuring that the holders of credentials achieve
              | better labor market outcomes than they would if access were unrestricted (Collins
              | 1979; Sørensen 2000). These different ideas about education have stimulated a
              | sizable literature that seeks to identify the productivity and rent components of
              | the effect of education on labor market outcomes (cf. Barone and Van de Werfhorst
              | 2011; Bowles and Gintis 2000, 2002). In 2011, the journal Research in Social Strati-
              | fication and Mobility (Bills and Brown 2011) dedicated an entire special issue to this
              | question.
              | Confronted with a regression that uses PIAAC to simultaneously estimate the
              | impact of educational certificates and skills on a labor market outcome, the most
              | straightforward response would perhaps be to interpret the net skills effect (con-
              | trolled for certificates) as reflecting productivity differentials and the net certifi-
              | cate effects (controlled for skills) as reflecting rents. This would only be appropri-
              | ate, however, if the meaning of skills (as measured in PIAAC) and of certificates did
              | not vary across countries. Yet our results for the lower skills gap suggest that this
              | is the case (see also Bills 2003: 439).
              | The clear negative relationship between occupation-specificity of upper sec-
              | ondary education and the lower skills gap (hypothesis 2a) is indirect evidence that
              | the intermediate group in more occupation-specific countries invests in occupa-
              | tion-specific rather than in the basic general skills that were measured in PIAAC.
              | This suggests that controlling for measured skills does not effectively remove
              | skills differentials between workers (with respect to occupation-specific skills),
              | particularly in occupation-specific systems. In addition to rent effects, the net ef-
              | fects of educational certificates would thus capture differentials with respect to
              | occupation-specific skills—especially in countries where upper secondary educa-
              | tion emphasizes these kinds of skills. Other things being equal, we would there-
              | – 29 –
              | fore expect to find larger net certificate effects on labor market outcomes in more
              | occupation-specific countries, as Van de Werfhorst (2011) already did on the basis
              | of the IALS data. Our results corroborate his interpretation that this pattern partly
              | reflects skills/productivity differentials (rather than only better opportunities for
              | generating rents via occupational licensing in more occupation-specific coun-
              | tries).
              | The finding that the lower skills gap rises with the level of vertical stratifica-
              | tion in lower secondary education (hypothesis 1a) may also have implications for
              | the labor market effects of educational credentials. In particular, this finding sug-
              | gests that having completed (at least) an intermediate-level educational program
              | is a better predictor of an individual’s actual level of skills in countries with high-
              | er levels of vertical stratification. Theories of job-market signaling (Spence 1973)
              | and statistical discrimination (Aigner and Cain 1977) suggest that this may en-
              | hance certificate effects even net of actual individual-level skills: These theories
              | argue that worker’s actual levels of skills or productivity are difficult to ascertain
              | and that prospective employer will rely on formal educational credentials as a
              | low-cost way of screening applicants. They should be especially likely to do so if
              | the credentials are highly informative with respect to the applicant’s actual level
              | of skills, which our findings suggest is the case in vertically stratifying countries.
              | This should amplify labor market effects of formal credentials even after control-
              | ling for actual individual skills or ability.
              | Future research should use PIAAC and similar data sets to empirically investi-
              | gate this possibility. Research along those lines should examine the lower and the
              | upper part of the educational distribution separately, as we found the impact of
              | vertical and horizontal stratification to be quite different for the lower and the
              | upper skills gap. Researchers thus need to carefully consider not only that the re-
              | lationship between competences and certificates differs across countries, but also
              | that the processes generating this relationship differ between the upper and the
              | lower parts of the educational distribution.
