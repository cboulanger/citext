              | Migration Experiences and Changes of Identity. The
              | Analysis of a Narrative
              | Kaja Kazmierska ∗
              | Abstract: This paper is based on the analysis of an autobio-
              | graphical narrative interview with a Turkish woman living
              | in Germany. I analyze the process of identity changes influ-
              | enced by the narrator’s migration experiences. It has at least
              | two aspects. One aspect refers to the cultural roots of the
              | narrator. New experiences have changed her self-image of
              | being a woman. A second aspect is connected with the nar-
              | rator’s life course. The narrative shows how a naive girl has
              | become an adult and independent woman. Being a woman
              | is defined with the help of categories belonging to Western
              | culture. Therefore, the process of migration is related to los-
              | ing culturally influenced ways of describing the narrator’s
              | identity. As a result, she becomes a stranger in her home-
              | land, but she also remains a stranger in the country to which
              | she migrated. I analyze the narrator’s work on this problem.
              | 1. Introduction
              | An autobiographical narrative interview with Hülya—a migrant woman from
              | Turkey—serves as an interesting example of biographical material. It enables
              | us to carry out the analysis of various aspects of one’s biography and social
              | processes that an individual can be involved in when migrating. This life story
              | exemplifies general features of the process of individuals’ mobility which can
              | be considered one of the characteristic phenomena of modern societies. Ac-
              | cording to PARK (1950, p.349), contemporary migration has been transmuted
              | from the previous form of invasion—caused, for example, by wars, epidemics,

              | modern societies migration does not have to be the consequence of rapid or
              | dramatic changes in social environments when, as the result, one group is dis-
              | placed by the other. Nevertheless, the process always affects an immigrant-
              | receiving society. It refers to both those who migrate and to the society to
              | which the migration takes place. In each case it is interpreted differently. Emi-
              | grants must face problems of adaptation in new social and cultural environ-
              | ments; whereas the immigrant receiving society must solve problems related to
              | new-comers, taking into account not only their economic needs but also social
              | and cultural differences, which may or may not be accepted.
              | In my country migration is still a new phenomenon if we consider Poland as
              | an immigrant-receiving society. In comparison with Western European coun-
              | tries it is a marginal phenomenon, although the situation has been gradually
              | changing since 1989. On the other hand, the people of my nation are very ex-
              | perienced in migrating. For example, since the beginning of the 19th century
              | we have had numerous huge waves of emigration due to political and economic
              | reasons. The last remarkable wave took place in the early 1980s when commu-
              | nist authorities established marshal law to suppress the Solidarity movement.
              | No doubt, migration gained its specific symbolic meaning in the Polish tra-
              | dition because of its political aspect: again and again many outstanding persons
              | had to leave the country. In such cases, mourning the lost homeland was their
              | main experience. This sorrow has been emphatically expressed in Polish litera-
              | ture and poetry. It is enough to mention that the Polish Romantic artistic output
              | was created abroad by the artists for whom longing for the country they left
              | behind was the major theme of many of their masterpieces.
              | Political reasons for Polish migration were sometimes “overused” by those
              | who aimed to leave the country because for economic reasons, especially dur-
              | ing the decade of the 1980s. During that time many people left the country
              | asking for political asylum, when economic needs were the real motives behind
              | their decision to leave. This aspect of migration is still important and it has
              | always been more significant to the majority of those Poles who decided to
              | migrate. In order to improve their fate Poles were leaving for richer European
              | countries, South America (e.g. Brazil), and above all, the United States. The
              | United States has always been identified in the Polish tradition as the country
              | of freedom and welfare. This economic immigration has been called “za chle-
              | bem” which can be translated as “looking for bread,” and is treated in Poland
              | as a symbol of fulfilling basic human needs. From this perspective, migration
              | remains an important process in the social history of Poland. These types of
              | Polish emigrants became protagonists of the “The Polish Peasant in Europe and
              | America” by THOMAS & ZNANIECKI (1918-1920) in which the proposal of
              | biographical studies was presented. By focusing on autobiographies of Polish
              | peasant emigrants and their correspondence with their families back home, the
              | authors analyzed the process of social change.

text          | Thus, taking into account the Polish “position” in the migration process, my
              | analysis has focused on the perspective of immigrants, in this case Hülya’s
              | perspective, and not the societies that receive them. Some aspects of Hülya’s
              | life story are not as clear to me as they are to my German colleagues knowing
              | the social and cultural context of Hülya’s experiences as an immigrant in Ger-
              | many.1
              | 2. The Analysis of the Narrative
              | 2.1. Introductory remarks
              | Biographical interview analysis usually begins with expressing general com-
              | ments related to first impressions after reading the text of the interview.2 My
              | remarks refer mostly to the first part of the narrative.
              | The first comment is connected with Hülya’s command of the German lan-
              | guage.3 According to the translator she speaks German very well; this can also
              | be seen in the English version of the transcription. Hülya does not have prob-
              | lems with describing feelings, emotions, motives, let alone events of her life.
              | Nevertheless, her skill at describing life experiences with the help of specifi-
              | cally selected symbolic categories is amazing. I particularly think of these
              | narrative sequences in which she tells about the official procedures which
              | contract laborers migrating to Germany had to pass through and about the
              | situation of Turkish migrants in Germany. Whenever Hülya introduces this
              | topic she effectively creates the image of more or less passive masses of people
              | who are at the mercy of powerful authorities. For example, she uses expres-
              | sions (“we were just a number, not personality any more” [219], “he had to /eh/
              | take a look, a close look /eh/ what is he paying for” [257-258], “no pride was
              | left afterwards” [311]4 which seem to perfectly characterize the situation of
              | emigrants. In my opinion, Hülya’s description corresponds with INOW-
              | LOCKI’s and LUTZ’s et al. (1998) remarks (presented in their paper in Mont-
              | real) about the language used by the German authorities organizing Turkish
              | labor migration. Some terms like “transport,” “epidemic-hygienic reasons”
              | (“seuchen-hygienische Gruende”) had been used by the Nazi-German regime,
              | 1 This problem is discussed in the paper of GÜLTEKIN, INOWLOCKI and LUTZ presented
              | in this issue.
              | 2 I refer to the stage of oral collective work on narrative interviews when each participant of a
              | group analyzing a specific case shares his or her first impressions with the others after read-
              | ing the text of the interview. Although it is just an introductory step of textual interpreta-
              | tion, it is, in my opinion, very important. It enables the participants to take into account dif-
              | ferent frames of interpretation that may be represented by each interpreter.
              | 3 The narrator’s language abilities are deeply analyzed by FRANCESCHINI in this issue.

meta          | 74
text          | and they expressed doubts with regard to the “sufficient capacity” of persons
              | deciding to migrate. This correspondence is more pronounced when Hülya uses
              | categories belonging to the symbolic universe of the country which she had
              | migrated to. For example, she makes the comparison to gas chambers in con-
              | centration camps: “We had a shower /eh/ downstairs for the whole house. It
              | looked /eh/ like gas /eh/ chambers in concentration camps, this shower. From
              | above /eh/. All three four /eh/ of us went in there right away because the water
              | always turned cold so fast” (454-457). I wonder whether she fully realizes the
              | meaning of this comparison, especially when it is used as a means of creating a
              | gloomy image of Turkish labor migrants inhumanely exploited in Germany.
              | A second comment relates to the first one. I have been amazed by the narra-
              | tor’s self presentation. Hülya seems to be a person who thinks a lot (even if we
              | consider her specific biographical situation at the time of the interview) about
              | her identity problems and her emotional life. In almost every narrative segment
              | she comments on her experiences. The commentaries serve to evaluate the
              | narrator’s past motives from her present perspective, to refer to her past state of
              | mind, but they also serve to “plan” or introduce future events and the narrator’s
              | reactions: for example, “I was lucky or unlucky5 that I passed after all” (244),
              | “somehow treated in an inhuman way, already in Istanbul” (226). These kinds
              | of commentaries in the form of short allusions show that Hülya has developed
              | a distance to her biographical story and that she controls it to some extent.
              | These remarks especially refer to the first part of the narrative, when Hülya
              | tells about her youth, and the first two years of migration. I do not suggest that
              | the narration was planned and that it is not a spontaneously recounted story.6 I
              | just want to stress that this style of narration and argumentation is a distinct
              | feature of Hülya’s story. In my previous research experience I very rarely read
              | such narratives. If I did, they usually belonged to highly educated persons who
              | had well-developed language skills and, in general, they were often used to tell
              | stories (for example, teachers).7 Thus, Hülya’s narrative serves as very good
              | material for analyzing biographical work on life experiences of an immigrant.
              | My work on this interview is based on Fritz SCHÜTZE’s procedure for nar-
              | rative analysis, focusing primarily on its first two steps—the analysis of
              | schemes of communication and structural description.8 Nevertheless, I do not
              | 5 In italics I mark expressions that allusively refer to future events which the narrator as an
              | actor could not anticipate at that specific time.
              | 6 Narration about biographical experiences should not be pre-rehearsed in order to reveal
              | what happened in the social area under study from the point of view of individuals acting in
              | it (SCHÜTZE, unpublished, p.3).
              | 7 In my research I mainly interview older people in Poland. I am interested in their war
              | experiences and usually ask them to concentrate on this phase of their lives, with the rest of
              | their lives serving as background. My research interests have focused on problems of na-
              | tional identity, displacement and the collective image of the war.
              | 8 The first step aims to identify different schemes of communication which are present in a
              | story in order to analyze how much of the empirical text material is the result of extempore
meta          | 75
text          | refer directly to this stage of analytical work, e.g., I do not present detailed
              | structural descriptions of narrative segments. In my opinion, there are at least
              | two ways of presenting the approaches of dealing with the substance of the
              | interview. One refers directly to analytical steps and shows the exact way of
              | proceeding, the other aims to present more general comments on the case
              | which had been studied. Here, I choose the second way of presentation, i.e., I
              | only concentrate on a specific aspect of Hülya’s experiences as a labor mi-
              | grant—her changes of identity.
              | 2.2. The process of identity changes
              | According to Anselm STRAUSS (1969) identity is subjected to constant proc-
              | esses of change. Although an individual tends to minimize this process and
              | establishes strategies for gaining a sense of personal continuity, transformations
              | of identity are an immanent part of each biography. Nevertheless, the change is
              | usually processual. Following experiences gradually make an individual
              | change his or her self-definitions. Changes can be marked by turning points
              | constituted by critical incidents. These moments in a biography enable an indi-
              | vidual to see the change and make him or her explore and validate new aspects
              | of self (STRAUSS 1969, p.93). The biographical situation of an immigrant
              | generates many critical incidents which reflect the impact of this experience on
              | one’s identity.
              | A striking example of the ‘milestone’ is found in the autobiographies of many
              | immigrants to America who later visited their native lands, only then realizing
              | how little affinity they had retained, how identified they had become with
              | America and Americans. Any return home, insofar as you have really left it,
              | will signalize some sort of movement in identity (STRAUSS 1969, p.93-94).
              | Hence, past changes can usually be clearly defined and evaluated from the
              | perspective of the present. In the case of the analyzed narrative, subsequent
              | visits to their home country play a crucial role in the process of reflective
              | awareness of an individual’s identity changes.
              | The deeper the change, the more elaborated the biographical work that has
              | to be done in order to integrate one’s experiences into more or less coherent
              | wholeness. Therefore, coming to terms with fragile aspects of one’s identity
              | can be a complicated and long-time process (STRAUSS, CORBIN, GLASER,
              | & MAINES, 1984). Such situations particularly refer to unexpected experi-
              | ences that can force an individual to face totally new challenges, e.g., illness
              | and physical disability. Biographical narrative interviews are very rich data for
              | analyzing this process of identity change and a narrator’s biographical work on
              | it because in his or her story the narrator reconstructs the processual logic of
              | narration of individual experiences. Structural description attempts to depict the social and
              | biographical processes rendered by the narrative (SCHÜTZE unpublished, p.3).
meta          | 76
text          | events (HERMANNS, 1987, p.50). In the case that we are dealing with here,
              | the narrator has serious problems with her poor health that surely influence her
              | self image, as can be seen in various segments of her interview.
              | I am going to reconstruct the experiences of Hülya’s biography which initi-
              | ated the process of identity change, and present her biographical work on it.
              | However, I do not concentrate on Hülya’s experience with illness; I will only
              | refer to those dimensions of her biography that are related to the collective
              | aspect of her experiences connected with the process of migration. In this con-
              | text, identity changes can be commented on from two perspectives. The first is
              | related to Hülya’s life course when the naive girl (which appears from the first
              | pages of the narrative) changes into the mature woman. The second is related to
              | the narrator’s cultural background. Social and cultural differences between
              | Turkey and Germany refer to (among others) differently defined roles of
              | women in each society. In Hülya’s biography these two perspectives are
              | closely related to each other. Her redefinition of her identity can be understood
              | against this background.
              | I refer to the following stages of her biography: Hülya as a young girl, the
              | first and the second year of her stay in Germany, and the next four years of her
              | migration.
              | 2.3. Hülya as a young girl
              | At the beginning of the interview Hülya remembers her childhood and she
              | presents herself as a teenage girl living in a typical rural Turkish family. She
              | seems to be a sensitive and intelligent girl. The relatively good life of her fam-
              | ily and her happy childhood are disturbed by her father’s illness and his inabil-
              | ity to work. Since that moment, poverty becomes the dominant experience of
              | her family life. Hülya, the girl, analyzes its consequences: no future for her and
              | her siblings and a miserable position for her mother in the family. She realizes
              | that her mother will be permanently dependent on male members of the family.
              | The girl also discovers what is going on “outside” of her life: She discovers
              | that those Turks living in Germany are well off.
              | The poverty of her family is the first important experience of Hülya as the
              | young girl. This stage of her biography has distinct features of trajectory9 initi-
              | ated by the unexpected illness of her father. The memory of a relatively good
              | childhood is replaced by the experience of poverty. She gradually realizes that
              | there is no future for her and her family: “it was ... a calamity” (161). Hülya’s
              | dream about Germany has become the only positive project for the future. The
              | teenage girl creates the image of her life: her temporary stay in Germany will
              | 9 Biographical “trajectory” is used here in the sense of one of structural processes of the life
              | course that represents the principle of being overwhelmed by outer events of the life course
              | which cannot be controlled by the biography incumbent. Suffering is the basic experiential
              | mode of biographical trajectory (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE, 1992).
meta          | 77
text          | change the economic status of the family. This thought has become a base of
              | her biographical action scheme.10 Such a project appears to be typical at this
              | stage of the migration process when a person creates positive plans for the
              | future. The plans are “located” in the immigrant-receiving society (RIEMANN
              | & SCHÜTZE, 1992). In Hülya’s case a biographical action scheme appears
              | very early, when the girl cannot realize it yet because she is too young. At the
              | beginning it is just a dream and as long as the project is a dream Hülya’s ex-
              | periences are related to intentional, planned social action regarding her future
              | life. To some extent, her plan resembles a fairy tale—the teenage girl wants to
              | become a fairy and change her family life. The more real the project becomes
              | the less it remains a dream.
              | Hülya’s plan is contrasted with her parents’ project for her life: “No, you
              | won’t go to Germany, you will stay here and one day you will get married
              | and/and your husband /eh/ to take care of you” (157-158). But soon her parents
              | change their minds and start supporting their daughter in her project, which
              | also becomes their plan to solve the difficult situation of the family. Slowly,
              | Hülya loses the ability of acting intentionally. Her parents and her brother start
              | working on her project instead of her. The girl’s biographical action scheme is
              | stopped at the stage of a great dream, whereas she starts to be gradually pushed
              | into a sequence of events that overwhelm her biography.
              | But from the present perspective Hülya also attributes another meaning to
              | these experiences. The father’s quoted words, when analyzed from the present
              | perspective of her biography, can be treated as a symbol of Hülya’s image of
              | life in Turkish society. She was expected to become an obedient woman who
              | would depend and rely on her future husband. Here, we can find one of the
              | most important motives for her migration. As the teenage girl, Hülya wants to
              | improve the financial status of her family, but after some time it appears that
              | she wants something more for herself—she wants to become more “independ-
              | ent” from socially and culturally defined roles of a woman reflected in Turkish
              | culture. She also does not want to be manipulated as she was when her family
              | worked on her leaving for Germany. This project becomes clear from the per-
              | spective of further life experiences, but the process of its crystallization begins
              | at this moment. “... I wanted to be independent somehow, but I didn’t know:
              | how, you know, but I also didn’t think about what would await me in Germany
              | or so” (159-161).
              | 10 I use quotation marks in order to stress that, in fact, Hülya’s departure for Germany was not
              | a realization of the dream that she had as the young girl.

text          | 2.4. The first year in Germany
              | The “dream”11 comes true. Leaving the family is very difficult. The seventeen
              | year old girl enters the unknown world. The clash of her naive expectations
              | with the reality which she encounters is very tragic. This experience is typical
              | for a migrant biography when an individual having positive plans looks for a
              | better future and gets disappointed by the circumstances and difficulties met at
              | the place of migration. Instead of developing biographical action schemes an
              | individual may enter a trajectory (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE, 1992). In the case
              | of Hülya these experiences are intensified by the girl’s vulnerability due to her
              | young age. Although Hülya had been pushed by her family to migrate, she still
              | has in mind her plan of improving the economic situation of the family.12 As a
              | result, she is subjected to very harmful experiences related to both collective
              | (all other Turkish workers are treated the same) and individual (Hülya’s acci-
              | dents) suffering. Thus, Hülya loses her ability to act intentionally. Work ap-
              | pears to be very difficult. She is forced to work in terrible conditions, but, at the
              | same time, she cannot return home:
              | Well, I already wanted to give up in the beginning, to run away. I said, ‘I
              | don’t care if I have money or not. I don’t want to stay here.’ But I /eh/ also
              | didn’t have money. When I came to Germany we had to take money from
              | other people. First, I had debts, that was an affair of honour, I had to pay this
              | back. And, second, I always thought, no one will believe me when I tell them
              | what /ehm/ has happened in Germany. And they will think that I might have
              | stolen something. Or... and therefore the police has sent me home and so on. I
              | say, ‘No’ and: I was also too proud to return again. To stay here was also /eh/
              | hell somehow (322-329).
              | In the quoted segment, Hülya analyzes her situation and gives the arguments
              | preventing her from going home. All the reasons are related to collective ex-
              | pectations and evaluations of her behavior. First, she had to pay back the debts
              | that were a matter of honor to her family. Hülya says “I had to pay this back”
              | but I suppose that it was her father who had borrowed the money. Nevertheless,
              | she felt responsible for delivering it. Second, Hülya felt that describing what
              | she had gone through would be doubted because of the prevalent collective
              | image of Germany as a welfare state. She suspected that this image was too
              | strong to be shaken and she was afraid of being accused of not being equal to
              | the task she had taken on. Thus, Hülya is in a tragic situation, because although
              | 11 A biographical action scheme is one of the structural processes of the life course represent-
              | ing intentional and long range planned social action regarding one’s own life (SCHÜTZE,
              | 1981).
              | 12 We can assume that if the circumstances of work in Germany had not been inhumane,
              | perhaps she would have been able to develop (or rather come back to) a biographical action
              | scheme even though she had experienced difficulties at the first stage of migration (new
              | environment, longing for her family, etc.).
meta          | 79
text          | she would like to return home, she cannot do so. There is no way out and each
              | solution must cause suffering. The experience of trajectory is developing and it
              | is strengthened by Hülya’s accidents which make her suffer (physically) more
              | than others.
              | The first year in Germany may be described in the context of the entire life
              | story as “a hard school of life.” The seventeen year old girl has to face unex-
              | pected experiences, do things she would never do in her country: endure pain
              | and physical disability. Some of these experiences (like her poor health) will
              | accompany further phases of Hülya’s biography. Nevertheless, the first year
              | remains the outstanding phase of suddenly passing from the naiveté of teenage
              | life to the maturity of young adulthood. However, these changes are still not
              | supported by changes in Hülya’s image of belonging to Turkish culture. She
              | continues to act according to culturally defined patterns. It can be seen in the
              | above presented argument in which she relates her decisions to the expectations
              | of her family.
              | Thus, Hülya continues at this stage of her biography to define herself with
              | the help of well known categories from her (Turkish) community. She accepts
              | her situation of depending on the expectations of others, including German
              | employers, because she does not have the means, both in a symbolic and mate-
              | rial sense, to act on her own—Hülya can neither speak German nor live on her
              | own. In this context the symbolic event representing Hülya’s first year in Ger-
              | many is referred to in the story by the account of receiving a permit of resi-
              | dence for the next year of her stay (418-448). She, as well as other Turkish
              | girls, did not have an idea of “What’s that supposed to be?” (429-430), how to
              | arrange it and what might have been the consequences of not having the permit
              | of residence. Hülya and the other girls were helped by the brother of a friend in
              | the dormitory: “we were glad ((she laughs)) and happy that (eh) someone had
              | done it for us” (447-448).
              | The story about the permit of residence points out a few aspects of Hülya’s
              | biographical experiences of that time. I have mentioned the first aspect: another
              | biographical experience is related to Hülya’s specific vulnerability due to her
              | young age. The second aspect refers to the situation of her migrant group (I
              | presume, Turkish migrant workers in general). The migrants are treated as
              | passive parts of a working machine and they seem to comply with these cir-
              | cumstances: “... we didn’t carry this through ourselves, the firm did every-
              | thing” (420-421). They have no idea what their rights as workers are. Hence,
              | they can be easily abused by the firm. Therefore, Hülya expresses in her story
              | the feeling of injustice. But the migrant workers also do not know enough
              | about legal requirements which they have to meet as foreign citizens. There-
              | fore, Hülya has no chance to act intentionally and she also does not feel the
              | need to build her independence.

text          | 2.5. The second year of Hülya’s stay in Germany
              | During her first year in Germany Hülya lives as if in two worlds. One world is
              | her work, the second world is the community of girls in the dormitory. All of
              | them are in the same situation. In the second year Hülya loses her peer group
              | which has been, aside from her family, her only reference group. For the first
              | time she feels totally alone. She characterizes the second year as “a hard blow.”
              | The first year of her stay in Germany includes the experience of hard physical
              | work and physical suffering. In the second year she learns how to cope with the
              | feeling of loneliness, and it appears to be even more difficult.
              | Hülya starts living with Turks who have been in Germany much longer than
              | she has. As she recalls:
              | I was ../eh/ totally different /eh/ from how I am today. I am still sentimental,
              | sensible today and I tend to act emotionally. I am not able to not look straight
              | at someone sitting across from me /eh/ .. Neither do I—I also don’t like super-
              | ficial people. I don’t like them either. But in former days I was even ..even
              | more sensible/ I have (it) from home. Human things and and love and comfort
              | were important for us and only machines were important here. The humans
              | were not important. And then we were just /eh/ ... people practically who did
              | the work, we didn’t count as something else. But that made me so sad because
              | our people had also become like that. Those had already been here for a
              | couple of years, just money, nothing else, you know. They just wanted to have
              | money (518-527).
              | In the quoted segment of the commentary Hülya refers to her experience of
              | loneliness and suffering caused by longing for her family. These feelings are
              | intensified by the comparison to the first year of her stay in Germany, when
              | they could be soothed, at least to some extent, by her belonging to the peer
              | group. Now Hülya has to cope with new experiences that create feelings of
              | being different that are expressed at the beginning of the quoted segment. Then
              | the narrator presents arguments to justify this feeling. Although she had already
              | mentioned the lack of interest of other Turks when she arrived in Germany, it
              | is, in my opinion, the first time she really feels that she distances herself from
              | other fellow Turks. There is a generation gap between her as a teenage girl and
              | her adult co-tenants. Hülya strongly experiences the clash of worlds. She de-
              | fines it not only in categories of age differences but also as a discrepancy be-
              | tween her own world full of positive feelings and based on family life (perhaps
              | a little idealized) and the world of Turkish (adult) immigrants to whom money
              | seems to be the most important value. Hülya builds a contrast between herself,
              | representing human values brought from her home, and Turkish migrants rep-
              | resenting, in fact, a German style of life. This contrast is very important be-
              | cause for the first time she does not define herself as a member of the commu-
              | nity that she formally joins, and she feels like an outsider in the group of her
              | fellow country women and men. I regard this moment as one of the crucial
meta          | 81
text          | turning points in the process of Hülya’s identity changes. Since that time the
              | experience of being different has become the basic means to describe the narra-
              | tor’s identity.
              | In the analyzed fragment the difference is expressed by the reference to
              | other Turkish labor migrants and to her own image when the narrator tries to
              | evaluate her changes of identity from the perspective of the present. Now she
              | regards herself as a person who, in the course of life, lost at least some part of
              | her sensibility and who had to redefine her identity. The statement: “I was.../eh
              | totally different from how I am today” (518-519) can be fully understood in the
              | context of the next phases of her biography.
              | Being different is variously experienced during Hülya’s life course. Though
              | the process of identity change is continuously developing, Hülya is still not
              | conscious of its character (this can be determined from the present perspective)
              | and intensity. Nevertheless, at this phase of her biography, the experience of
              | being different becomes a “key experience” which step by step results in dis-
              | tancing herself from her family and values offered by Turkish society.
              | 2.6. The next four years
              | There are two main lines at this stage of Hülya’s biography: her marriage and
              | phases of serious illness. This part of the narrative is not as clear as the story
              | about the narrator’s first two years in Germany. But while the ambiguity of her
              | illness as it appears in her narrative is the result of doctors’ silence, the vague-
              | ness of Hülya’s story about her marriage shows that she tries to block from
              | awareness certain aspects of her biography and that coming to terms with the
              | transformation of her identity is still in process.
              | In 1976 (four years after leaving home) Hülya gets married in Turkey. Dur-
              | ing these years she has been thinking about returning home: “I didn’t want to
              | return to Germany. I wanted to go back to Turkey. I could not imagine that I
              | /eh/ would endure this here for fourteen years” (546-548). There are a few
              | reasons that make her treat her stay in Germany as a short episode in her biog-
              | raphy. First, she has always planned a temporary stay in Germany; second, the
              | first years in Germany were connected with experiences of suffering; third, she
              | is strongly attached to her family, especially to her mother (from another part
              | of the narrative we can learn that she has always had a close relationship with
              | her mother); and fourth, Germany is still a distant country—she does not speak
              | German and she has no relationships with German people. All these reasons
              | support her decision to get married.
              | Hülya describes her marriage in two parts of the narrative (546-573 and
              | 671-731) which are divided by the long story about the health problems she
              | experienced when she went back to Germany for a year as a newly married
              | woman. I do not always refer to both segments chronologically when looking
              | for reasons for Hülya’s decisions concerning and explanations of her failure.
meta          | 82
text          | There are two significant dimensions of the narrator’s experiences: one is
              | Hülya’s attitude to her marriage, the other is the role of her mother in arranging
              | the marriage.
              | Hülya’s attitude towards her marriage is shaped by the process of a gradual
              | change in her identity. The experiences that she reported earlier played a cru-
              | cial role in the process of redefining her identity. But Hülya can recognize their
              | meaning from the more distant time perspective—her marriage begins the
              | process of conscious reflection on her identity. Hülya has spent four years in
              | Germany but in deciding to get married she negates experiences she has gained
              | during this time. She acts according to well known patterns which are tradi-
              | tionally grounded in Turkish society—“One day you will get married and/and
              | your husband has /eh/ to take care of you” (157-158). So she gets married. But
              | soon she feels uncomfortable in the new situation because she cannot adjust, or,
              | rather, come back to the role of the Turkish woman. Hülya gradually begins
              | identifying herself as a person who no longer can act according to the expecta-
              | tions of her traditional environment. Experiences of her stay in Germany ac-
              | quire a new meaning in the process of her interpretation of her biographical
              | situation.
              | Hülya tries to explain why she decides to get married. She does not love her
              | future husband and she also does not have a chance to get familiar with him
              | and develop emotional attachments. She spent this phase of her life course
              | working very hard in Germany. In this description Hülya presents two scenar-
              | ios of the young girl. The first one is the preplanned marriage of convenience
              | which is supported by both families. The second one is getting to know some-
              | body as the result of being a member of a peer group. As she sees it, one of the
              | scenarios is part of traditional Turkish culture, the other, of Western culture.
              | Although Hülya does not miss the Western teenage life style and she subordi-
              | nates herself to her family, it is important that she has already learned that there
              | exists another possibility for a girl/woman to plan her biography. Perhaps as
              | the result of this knowledge, she makes her husband accept a one year leave for
              | Germany in order to keep at least some independence in her future marriage.
              | The situation when a newly married woman is leaving her husband and ne-
              | gotiating as long a leave as possible (Hülya prefers two years) appears rather
              | bizarre if looking at it from the outside. A question arises: Why does she dis-
              | tance herself from family life which she treats as the most important value?
              | The answer is related to her identity changes. Hülya does not neglect family
              | ties as such, but she cannot accept herself in the role of a traditional Turkish
              | wife. Thus, the process of the destruction of Hülya’s marriage starts from its
              | very beginning. The only motives to get married are identification with the
              | Turkish culture and expectations of others (mother and father) and these mo-
              | tives gradually weaken.
              | It is interesting to compare Hülya’s way of argumentation with the previ-
              | ously quoted commentary. Now she says:
meta          | 83
text          | I said ‘I have nothing, no money, didn’t buy anything either’ I say. At any rate
              | I had been in Germany for four, five years.. /Eh/ ‘When I have children later
              | and so that I ... can tell (them) at least that I had been to Germany and that I
              | had bought this or that and so on, memories and some electric things and
              | household goods and so on’ (566-570).
              | Here Hülya uses arguments that she previously neglected when accusing “ex-
              | perienced” Turkish immigrants of appreciating money as the most important
              | value. Now she acts in a similar way. On the other hand, she wants to go back
              | to Germany in order to make sense of the hard work she experienced there
              | from the very beginning. Hülya devoted four years of her life to support her
              | family, now she wants to turn these hard experiences to her advantage.
              | After a year Hülya returns from Germany with serious health problems. She
              | expects that her husband and his family will also experience her suffering as
              | their (family) problem. But to the contrary, Hülya’s duties as a wife are consid-
              | ered by them far more important than the state of her health. As a result, physi-
              | cal suffering caused by a series of illnesses “helps” the narrator to concentrate
              | on her personal experiences. Hülya starts to crystallize her attitude towards the
              | social environment and she slowly refuses to be a part of a marriage of cultural
              | need. She defines it as a cultural pattern that has become empty for her. Thus,
              | Hülya does not describe the failure of her marriage in terms of a personal ex-
              | perience (as she does in the case of her illness), such as lost feelings, missed
              | hopes, unhappiness, but she does it in terms of belonging to two completely
              | different worlds. She is no longer part of the Turkish society as she had known
              | it before.
              | Another important aspect influencing Hülya’s experiences is her mother’s
              | role in organizing the marriage. Although the marriage was preplanned by both
              | families, Hülya’s mother played a major role in this process. It is not clear to
              | me to what extent the narrator’s mother was the one who supported her daugh-
              | ter’s migration to Germany. Perhaps she was supporting her husband’s deci-
              | sions. When Hülya left, her mother suffered from loneliness; she also saw her
              | daughter’s miserable state of health. When Hülya got married her mother suf-
              | fered by seeing her unhappy, but at the same time she could not accept that her
              | daughter would try to reorganize her life (for example, Hülya’s mother did not
              | accept the divorce). Thus, the role of the narrator’s mother in her biography is
              | ambivalent. On the one hand, there was a very strong positive emotional rela-
              | tionship between the mother and daughter but on the other hand it was, in fact,
              | her mother who made Hülya accept the marriage which appeared to be a great
              | misunderstanding. Nevertheless, Hülya tries to remain loyal to her mother and
              | she uses various strategies in order not to blame her openly. For example,
              | through the entire interview Hülya presents her mother as her most important
              | significant other; she also stresses her mother’s suffering caused by her longing
              | for her and then by problems in her (Hülya’s) marriage; moreover, when Hülya
              | says that her mother’s expectations forced her to accept, and then continue, the
meta          | 84
text          | marriage for some time, she usually weakens the importance of this fact by
              | pointing to others representing the same position, for example: “only my
              | mother and my parents/ well, actually I was a victim (Hadn’t been constrained)
              | but my mother and my parents/ well actually I was a victim” (729-730). After
              | saying “my mother” she immediately adds “my parents” or she says, “our
              | mothers, my mother and my mother-in-law have experienced life quite differ-
              | ently. They only accept one reason for divorce, my mother or /eh/ Turkish
              | women” (718-719). From this perspective her mother represents collective
              | expectations and she is not the only person to be blamed.
              | Hülya decides to leave her husband in 1978, and gets divorced in 1980.
              | From field notes we learn that 1980 was also the year of her mother’s death,
              | which she witnessed. The narrator does not speak about this in her story. I find
              | two possible explanations of this fact. First, she does not want to reveal this
              | traumatic experience in the interview situation and suppresses her mourning.
              | Second, she does not mention her mother’s death because of the constraints of
              | story telling13, she should explain the coincidence of the date of her divorce
              | with her mother’s death and this could cause the need for descriptions of mu-
              | tual relationships and her mother’s role in the unsuccessful design of Hülya’s
              | biography. This would be true especially since the narrator identifies herself as
              | the victim of this design: “I always sacrificed myself for other people” (731).
              | Although Hülya cannot see any single advantage of her marriage (the only
              | consequence was getting the status of a “divorced woman”), it is one of the
              | most important turning points in her identity change. She becomes aware of her
              | independence and responsibility for her project of life. The history of Hülya’s
              | marriage has become the first clear sign of her identity change. She starts it as a
              | traditional Turkish woman—the daughter fulfilling expectations of her par-
              | ents—but she quickly realizes that she is no longer the same person. The mar-
              | riage has become a misunderstanding because her project of life no longer
              | corresponds with the stereotypical image of a Turkish woman. Thus, the year
              | 1980 is a symbolic cutting of the umbilical cord in the sense of the closest
              | family ties (that is her mother’s death) as well as social and cultural relation-
              | ships with her home country—Hülya attains the status of a divorced woman
              | which stigmatizes her in Turkish society. I think that from this moment on she
              | stops considering Turkey as the country to which she would like to return.14
              | This supposition can be supported by the “German” line of Hülya’s biography.
              | In 1978 the narrator applies for compensation.15 For the first time she de-
              | cides to act in her own behalf in Germany. “I had to learn how to go the way,
              | 13 According to SCHÜTZE there are three constraints to story telling: the constraint to close
              | the form, to condense, and to go into details (cf. HERMANNS, 1987).
              | 14 Although in different parts of the narrative Hülya declares her readiness to go back one day,
              | she also mentions frequently the reasons why she does not feel like returning.
              | 15 It is also the year when she definitely decides to leave her husband and she tells about
              | compensation in the next segment of the narrative (just after the story about her marriage).
meta          | 85
text          | how to go to a labor court, how you (get) a lawyer /eh/ I said ‘I have to do all
              | of this by myself. I have to get my experiences” (741-742). We may compare
              | this decision with her statement referring to the end of the first year in Ger-
              | many: “Well, everyone of us got a permit of residence for three months, we
              | were glad ((she laughs)) and happy that /eh/ someone had done this for us”
              | (447-448). Learning to be independent is not an easy task. She receives com-
              | pensation but she does not achieve full success because, as she learns later, she
              | has chosen the wrong lawyer. Nevertheless, thanks to compensation she can
              | start living on her own.
              | At the same time Hülya loses her job and, in order to earn her living, she has
              | to accept a job in gastronomy, treating it as a temporary situation. This work is
              | “A kind of work which I had never ((she laughs)) liked: In the gastronomy, in
              | the kitchen. At that time I didn’t want to be out of work any /eh/ longer. I said
              | ‘If you want to, you can do everything’. And later on when I find something
              | better I’d get another job” (792-793). Therefore, Hülya starts looking for a job
              | she could and would like to do. The comparison of this attitude with the first
              | year of Hülya’s stay in Germany shows that now she gains the ability to act
              | intentionally and plan her life, even if she is aware of constraints on her situa-
              | tion.
              | In 1980 Hülya starts learning German. She decides to do it after eight years
              | of being in Germany. This is another step of being independent and not at
              | another’s mercy, such as in the first year of her stay when she could not com-
              | municate with German superiors. Hülya gradually learns how to be independ-
              | ent and what it means to be independent. She organizes her life and changes
              | from a passive to an active person. This change refers to both the “Turkish”
              | and the “German” line of her biography. Turkey remains her homeland,
              | whereas she begins to treat Germany as the country where she prefers to live
              | right now. The fact that she started learning German in 1980 is further proof
              | that this year was a turning point in her biography. Hülya definitely changed
              | her status in Turkey. We do not know if she decided at the same time to choose
              | Germany as her country of residence. The idea of learning the language may
              | support this supposition. Nevertheless, the knowledge of language enables her
              | to change her status in Germany. She can no longer be considered a “working
              | machine,” having no rights and being treated as “half human” because of lim-
              | ited possibilities of communication.16
              | 3. Conclusions
              | Hülya’s first eight years of migration are a time of fundamental changes in her
              | identity. As I intended to present, they are related to specific sequences of the
              | 16 She presents such an image describing her first year in Germany.
meta          | 86
text          | narrator’s experiences as a migrant laborer. The first two years present a great
              | shock for her, especially given her vulnerability as a seventeen year old girl.
              | Events of this time have made her more mature and experienced. Thus, during
              | the next years the process of identity changes refers to her image of being an
              | adult person (woman). These changes began at the time of her migration, but
              | Hülya gradually realizes that she is no longer the same person because she
              | cannot act in accordance with the earlier concept of her identity. She verifies
              | this conviction in the course of visits or vacations, her marriage, and her
              | mother’s death. All of these experiences make her realize that she has become
              | increasingly different from the expected model of a Turkish woman: “I am not
              | this ... good ... little mother of the family daughter of the family who has been
              | influenced from infancy” (927-928). While living in Germany she learns how
              | to cope with problems on her own. She tastes independence: “I know more
              | about the world” (927).
              | As I suggested, the experience of being different plays a crucial role in this
              | process. Hülya starts identifying herself as somebody who is different, at first
              | in her peer group, then in her Turkish environment, then in Turkish society, and
              | finally in German society. I have already discussed the first two aspects of this
              | experience. Let me now turn to her attitude towards Turkish and German socie-
              | ties.
              | The quoted self-commentary and other statements show that changes in her
              | identity are related to different images of women in Turkish and German socie-
              | ties. According to Hülya, such values as being financially and morally inde-
              | pendent and having your own life project are not accepted in the cultural pat-
              | tern of being a woman in Turkish society. Therefore, Hülya describes changes
              | in her identity using categories referring to men’s and women’s roles in both
              | societies, and that is the main reason for feeling like an outsider in her country
              | of origin. Fourteen years after her migration she neither identifies with Turkey
              | as a country nor with the lifestyle of Turkish society. Hülya’s image of a
              | woman is what motivates her own choices, especially her decision to live in
              | Germany. Hülya concentrates on stressing contrasts to give a reasonable back-
              | ground to the interpretation of her choices.
              | The narrator has passed through all the stages of a migration process: great
              | plans for a better life (biographical action scheme), great disappointments when
              | dreams clash with reality (trajectory—in her case intensified by illness), a
              | stabilization of biography (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE, 1992). She has achieved
              | her aim after many difficulties. But in her post-coda commentary Hülya charac-
              | terizes herself as an “empty” person. Why is she not satisfied? What is the
              | price for her independence? For sure, her chronic illness is one of the important
              | experiences influencing her feelings. But first of all, the “emptiness” is con-
              | nected with the feeling of being a stranger both in Turkey and in Germany. She
              | identifies with German society but her Turkish origins remain a stigma. Thus,
              | Hülya gains the status of a marginal person in both societies.
meta          | 87
text          | The case of Hülya serves as a very good example of a marginal person—the
              | concept introduced by PARK (1950) and STONEQUIST (1961). “The mar-
              | ginal man is one whom fate has condemned to live in two societies and in two,
              | not merely different but antagonistic cultures” (PARK, 1950, p.XV). Such a
              | situation may occur as a result of migration.
              | Although Hülya is in a marginal position in both societies, her own interpre-
              | tation of this situation is different in the case of each country. The narrator does
              | not accept the way in which Turkish society evaluates her status as a (divorced)
              | woman. Therefore, Hülya chooses the role of marginal person in Turkish soci-
              | ety. She distances herself from its values, and she is not up to date to what is
              | going on in Turkish life, politics, economy etc. Whereas in Germany she is
              | situated in a marginal position of not being accepted in German society because
              | of her being different. Hülya represents a minority which is “partially assimi-
              | lated and psychologically identified with the dominant group without being
              | fully accepted” (STONEQIUST 1961, p.121). STONEQUIST enumerates three
              | possibilities for a marginal person to develop his or her biography: “1) assimi-
              | lation into the dominant group; 2) assimilation into the subordinate group; or 3)
              | some form of accommodation, perhaps only temporary and incomplete, be-
              | tween the two groups” (p.130). In my opinion, Hülya represents the third type.
              | She is in-between two cultures. She has distanced herself from Turkish society
              | and at the same time, being a Turk, she aspires to be a member of German
              | society.
              | The paradox of her case refers to the fact that (in terms of her present iden-
              | tity) she is no longer a Turkish woman, and she is also not an accepted German
              | citizen although she wants to be a part of German society. That is why she talks
              | about going back “one day.” But I think she will not because of the significant
              | changes in her identity.
