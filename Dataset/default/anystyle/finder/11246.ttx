              | Abstract
              | Using the case of German foreign direct investments (FDI) in Hungary, this
              | paper is dealing with the international transfer of industrial models in
              | multinational corporations (MNCs). Based on qualitative research in 10 German
              | MNCs, that have invested in Hungary during the 1990ies, the paper criticizes
              | some central arguments of the national business system approach towards
              | corporate internationalisation, especially the notion of a rather strong and
              | uniform country of origin effect.

              | Introduction1
              | One of the core topics of the debate on national business systems is the ques-
              | tion whether different national models are converging into a single model (no
              | matter whether this model already exists or is still emerging as a kind of "third"
              | model) or whether the models more or less stay as diverse as they are (or even
              | get more diverse). In this debate, a point frequently mentioned to prove either
              | convergence or divergence of national business systems is the role played by
              | multinational corporations (MNCs), i.e. companies that are by definition located
              | in more than just one national business system. Here the national business
              | systems literature generally assumes, that MNCs from a specific home country
              | interfere into the existing competitive and institutional settings of the countries in
              | which they invest, mainly by transferring as far as possible their production
              | techniques and labour practices. While this rather general assumption is cer-
              | tainly not wrong, some of its more detailed arguments – especially on the unity
              | of the behaviour of all MNCs from a certain home country as well as on the
              | unity of locational and organisational conditions in the host country – seem to
              | be debatable.
              | Following this objective, this paper, using the empirical case of German
              | foreign direct investment (FDI) in Hungary, will put emphasis on heterogeneity,
              | both of the transfer strategies of MNCs from a certain home country (Germany)
              | as well as of the locational conditions in the host country (Hungary). After a
              | short review of some central assumptions of the national business systems ap-
              | proach to corporate internationalisation and a few theoretical remarks on the
              | international transfer of industrial models in MNCs, we first look, whether there
              | is a uniform German industrial model, all German MNCs might feel inclined to
              | transfer when investing abroad. Since not all elements of a national industrial
              | 1 This paper presents some results from an ongoing empirical research project on "Exogenous
              | Influences in path dependent transformation processes: The effects of German FDI on work
              | organisation and labour relations in Hungary". The project is funded by the Volkswagen
              | Foundation and hosted by the Free University, Berlin. For a description of the wider aims of
              | this project, that the author is conducting together with M. Fichter (Free University, Berlin), L.

              | whose transfer lie in the hands of MNCs. That is: the transfer of (1) the produc-
              | tion model encompassing e.g. technology, machinery (and associated skills)
              | production and work organisation and (2) the transfer of the model of labour
              | practices including specific human resource management (HRM) and industrial
              | relations (IR) practices. Next to that we will shift perspectives and look at re-
              | gional differences that Hungary displays as a location for foreign investments.
              | Having thus dealt with the institutional background we will take an empirical look
              | at the real transfer processes that occurred in German MNCs investing in
              | Hungary.

              | Systems
              | Dealing with MNCs from an institutionalist point of view is a rather new phe-
              | nomenon. It was not until the beginning of the 1990s that institutionalist thinking,
              | strongly put forward in the 1970s and 1980s, was applied to MNCs (Westney
              | 1993) and its advent can be seen as a step against the strong dominance of
              | best practice approaches at that time. Best practice approaches, popularised by
              | management consultancies and some parts of business academia derive a
              | single best practice for the internationalisation of companies from their under-
              | standing of relevant market forces such as transnational product harmonisation,
              | the growing importance of fixed costs and the fact that major innovations occur
              | in all regions of the Triad. In this view, more or less all MNCs have to apply a
              | value-based management style and to go for global presence while integrating
              | economies of scale and national responsiveness (Bartlett/Goshal 1989, Ohmae
              | 1990). The institutionalist view strongly opposes the idea that market con-
              | straints impose a specific best practice to the international co-ordination and
              | configuration of an MNC and instead stresses that the specific social and insti-
              | tutional environment of an MNC is the dominant (or sole) source of normative
              | pressure that shapes the behaviour of an MNC. According to this view, MNCs
              | are by no means free to choose a single best practice solution, but their
              | internationalisation is shaped by their specific economic, political and institu-
              | tional home environment (e.g. Ruigrok/van Tulder 1995). However, very much
              | like the best practice approach, pure institutionalist explanations on corporate
              | internationalisation have been criticised for not being complex enough. Mueller
              | (1994) stressed that the behaviour of MNCs generally reflects both societal
              | 2 One striking example is the export of the German vocational training system. While the com-
              | pany can decide whether to introduce the on-the-job part of the vocational training system in
              | foreign subsidiaries, it has no final control whether the state in which it is investing maintains
              | or is willing to build up a system of vocational schools (cf. Bluhm 2001, Tüselmann et al.
              | 2000).

text          | embeddedness and global best practices, with global best practices mainly
              | spurred by: (1) a growing convergence of product and process technology
              | within sectors, (2) an increasing use of benchmarking as a tool for cross-
              | sectoral dissemination of best practices and (3) a strong exchange of technol-
              | ogy and management practices within MNCs. Taking that differentiation a step
              | further, Dörrenbächer (2000) added corporate idiosyncrasies as an explanatory
              | factor for the internationalisation of companies. As a reason he mentions that
              | there is manifold empirical evidence that companies rooted in the same industry
              | (or segment thereof) and the same national business system show remarkable
              | differences in their internationalisation behaviour. According to this approach
              | corporate idiosyncrasies might be shaped by structural aspects (such as the
              | age, the size or the degree of diversification of a company) as well as by the
              | “specific historical development or in other words the “trajectory” (Boyer/
              | Freyssenet 1995) of a company.
              | Beyond the critique, that the national business system approach (alone) is
              | not complex enough to explain the real life variance in overall corporate interna-
              | tionalisation, a second point to be explored in more detail in this paper, needs
              | specific attention: Many institutionalist approaches to MNCs (e.g. Hu 1992,
              | Sally 1994, Ruigrok/van Tulder 1995, Pauly/Reich 1997, Whitley 1999, Morgan
              | et al. 2000) put a strong emphasis on the impact of the country of origin (or the
              | home country) of the MNC. This is somewhat ignoring the fact the multinational
              | corporations are sui generis located in more than one national business system
              | with both home and (different/multiple) host country effects being at work. While
              | Morgan et al. (2000) explain this limitation by pragmatic reasons, Whitley (2001)
              | considers host country as well as foreign subsidiary influences as rather un-
              | interesting since, according to his opinion, these influences are in most cases
              | not very likely to provoke a fundamental organisational change throughout the
              | whole MNC: The “… discussion of how different kinds of firm from different
              | business systems and institutional contexts are likely to conduct their FDI in
              | contrasting business environments emphasizes the continuing importance of
              | their domestic institutions and established ways of coordinating economic
              | activities in their home economies” (Whitley 2001: 60-61). Here, two remarks
              | have to be made.
              | – First, the very strong emphasis on the country of origin influences seems to
              | be debatable, taking into consideration the strong strategic desire of the top
              | management of many MNCs to flee certain aspects of their country of origin
              | business system and/or to learn from or to experiment with aspects of other
              | business systems. In addition it has to be kept in mind that today the domi-
              | nant way to internationalise is external growth by (often rather large) M&As
              | (Wortmann 2000), and it is especially these large acquired subsidiaries and
              | their managers that are assigned a strategic role, “… not only for their own
              | company but for the MNC as a whole” (Hedlund 1986: 22). In this perspec-
              | tive, that has received growing attention in recent years (e.g. Goshal/Nohria
meta          | 3
text          | 1989, Gupta/Govindarajan 1994, Birkinshaw et al. 1998, Kristensen/Zeitlin
              | 1999, Gammelgard 2000) foreign subsidiaries are no longer seen as "merely
              | distant tools of corporate management, reacting as ganglia to impulses sent
              | downward through the bureaucratic nervous system" (Taggert 1998) but as
              | important strategic parts of MNCs, that due to their specific organisational
              | assets and local embeddedness might systematically contribute to the firm
              | specific advantages of MNCs.
              | – Second, taking an overall MNC perspective like Whitley does, is systemati-
              | cally hiding host country influences, that might have a strong influence on the
              | foreign subsidiaries of the MNC in question. Such host country influences are
              | reported to be especially strong with regard to all human resource manage-
              | ment and industrial relations issues (Rosenzweig/Nohira 1994, UNCTAD
              | 1994). Next to that, taking an overall MNC perspective is only delivering one
              | single picture for the MNC, despite the fact that by nature an MNC encom-
              | passes many different views, that in many cases lead to very relevant micro
              | political struggles with the MNC.
              | All in all it seems that the national business system approach (despite strong
              | merits in the comparison of MNCs from different home countries) can only partly
              | explain corporate internationalisation and thus needs to be accomplished by
              | other approaches. One such approach, that is more opening the “black box” of

              | The Transfer of Industrial Models in MNCs
              | Ever since the first industrial revolution, the transfer either of single technologies
              | or production models as a whole was of specific importance for the economic
              | development of nations. Britain’s early start in the industrialisation around 1750
              | triggered a first intense phase of technology transfer to continental Europe,
              | Scandinavia and the USA in the late 18th Century (ÓBrien 1986, Bruland 1991).
              | More than hundred years later, around the first World War, Fordism in the
              | United States generated a new standard of productive efficiency transferred to
              | Europe and (to a lesser extent) to Japan (Kipping/Bjarnar 1998, Zeitlin/Herrigel
              | 2000), superseded in the 1970s by the “global Japanisation” (Elger/Smith
              | 1994). The study of these great historic transfer cases reveals that there is both
              | a multitude of (individual and collective) transfer agents as well as a great
              | variety of transfer channels. Thus looking at the transfer in and by MNCs (as in
              | this paper) is only a partial view, though not an unimportant one. With regard to
              | the transfer of industrial models via MNCs at least the following three analytical
              | levels seem to be relevant: content, results and processes.

text          | 3.1. Content
              | Up until now the question on what is transferred by multinationals while invest-
              | ing abroad is mostly treated implicitly. One of the more explicit treatments of this
              | question is done by Sölvell/Zander (1998) who distinguish between the transfer
              | of physical, human and social capital, with the transfer of physical capital such
              | as standard materials, components, products and machinery being the most
              | mobile, human capital, embodied e.g. in the tacit knowledge of the workers,
              | being less mobile and social capital, embedded e.g. in social relations in (local)
              | business networks, being the least mobile. However, in real transfer processes,
              | the transfer of one type of capital is usually strongly connected to the transfer of
              | a second or even a third type of capital. A particularly strong connection seems
              | to exist between the transfer of physical and human capital. There is strong evi-
              | dence that even the transfer of the rather mobile machinery (or technology) is
              | burdened with many problems (Gertler 1995). These problems arise from the
              | fact that machinery (or technology) always consist of a kind of hardware (or
              | software) and knowledge, with the knowledge in most cases being localised and
              | tacit, taking the form of un-codified skills or capabilities (Bruland 1991). Going
              | beyond the transfer of a single machine or technology and looking at the trans-
              | fer of whole industrial models, similar, but much more complex problems arise.
              | This is easily understandable looking at what is an industrial model. According
              | to the definition underlying this paper an industrial model consists of (1) a pro-
              | duction model encompassing e.g. technology, machinery (and associates skills)
              | production and work organisation and (2) a model of labour practices including
              | specific human resource management (HRM) and industrial relations (IR) prac-
              | tices.
              | Up to now only a few studies, such as the work of the Gerpisa Group on the
              | transfer and hybridisation of production models in the automobile industry look
              | at transfer issues in such a broad and interconnected way (Boyer/Freyssenet
              | 2000, Boyer et al. 1998, Dörr/Kessel 1999). However, there is a wealth of lit-
              | erature that focuses on the transfer of HRM and IR practices (such as trade
              | union recognition, collective pay bargaining, shop floor employee representa-
              | tion, employee information, consultation and participation) throughout MNCs
              | (for a recent overview cf. Tüselmann et al. 2000).
              | 3.2. Results
              | Almost all empirical studies that look at the cross-border transfer of industrial
              | models come to the conclusion that a certain amount of change is always nec-
              | essary to successfully run a factory or a business developed in one national
              | business system abroad. However, this does not mean that a one-to-one
              | transfer is excluded in reality, especially not with regard to the transfer of single
meta          | 5
text          | technologies or single HRM/IR aspects. Thus catching all levels of analysis, a
              | typology that measures changes associated with cross-border transfer proc-
              | esses in our opinion has to comprise (1) one-to-one transfers, (2) simple adap-
              | tation, where only minor changes occur, (3) real hybridisation, where the trans-
              | fer process result in something that strongly deviates both from what was
              | intended to transfer and from corresponding indigenous solutions, and (4) the
              | assertion of indigenous solutions (cf. too Boyer et al. 1998).
              | 3.3
              | Processes
              | Up until now a clear process focus is somewhat underrepresented in the litera-
              | ture on the transfer of industrial models. Next to the general literature on expa-
              | triates, there are only a few studies that have looked in greater detail at the
              | quality and the sequencing of transfer processes, including the way or the proc-
              | ess how local adaptations or even hybridisations occur. Interestingly, almost all
              | of these studies concentrate on transfer processes undertaken by western
              | MNCs to their subsidiaries in Eastern Europe. For instance Rudolph (2000),
              | looking at transfer processes to Polish subsidiaries emanating from their west-
              | ern parent companies, stresses that transfer always involves stays abroad,
              | either of the personnel from the model sending unit or from the model receiving
              | unit. Moreover, she emphasises that personal relationships are a major vehicle
              | in the transfer process, with the expatriate mangers playing different roles such
              | as “... bicultural interpreter, national defender and advocate or frontline imple-
              | menter of corporate strategy” (Paauwe/Dewe 1994:97). A detailed look into the
              | quality of personal relationships during transfer processes is given by Kessel/
              | Dörr (1998). One of the companies they looked at used a kind of a tandem-
              | management with expatriates and local managers sharing for a certain time the
              | both the job and the responsibility. These tandems were designed as instru-
              | ments to effectively transfer knowledge from the expatriate to the local man-
              | ager. However, it turned out, that these tandems became important micro-politi-
              | cal arenas for the solution of conflicts on social, cultural as well as practical
              | issues. This study also sheds light on the fact that transfer strategies might
              | change dramatically over the time. Due to many conflicts in those management
              | tandems, it was also detected that the original intention to more or less fully
              | transfer the country of origin industrial model would go too far and negatively
              | affect crucial questions of identity and status of the local personnel. This
              | resulted in a significant rewriting of the transfer strategy, with the modernised
              | subsidiary finally turning out as a real hybrid, which was not intended before,
              | but turned out to be a successful solution.
              | After this short discussion of transfer issues, we will now turn to our empiri-
              | cal case. We will first take a short look at the German Model, its main pillars and
              | its inherent logic. Based on our assumption that the German Model was never
meta          | 6
text          | as consistent as it is often presented, as well as on the thesis of an increasing
              | heterogeneity within the German Model since the beginning of the 1990s
              | (Flecker/Schulten 1999, Muller 1999), we will show that there are different com-
              | pany specific interpretations of the German Model so far, that might be the
              | basis of what German companies wish to export when internationalising.
              | 4.
              | The German Model and its Industry/Company-Specific
              | Interpretation
              | There is little disagreement on what the main pillars of the German Model are.
              | According to a recent definition that draws on a wealth of former works (e.g.
              | Katzenstein 1980, Markovitz 1982, Streeck 1995, just to mention a few), the
              | German Model consists of the following main items (Flecker/Schulten 1999: 83,
              | points are added):
              | – “social market economy” (Soziale Marktwirtschaft), that is, capitalism tamed
              | by political macro-regulation and redistribution by the state;
              | – long term perspectives and a preference for productive investments on the
              | part of the capital;
              | – highly organised industrial relations combining sectoral multi-employer bar-
              | gaining and co-operative labour relations within the enterprise;
              | – a vocational training system that combines on-the-job-training with the edu-
              | cation in vocational schools and
              | – diversified quality production based on highly skilled workforces“
              | Somewhat overlapping with these items the more recent discussion has
              | emphasised the specific aspect of corporate governance (e.g. Albert 1993,
              | Caspar/Vitols 1997, Lallement 2001). Here the German Model is usually asso-
              | ciated with the following three items:
              | – the strong role of the banks in providing long-term credit leading to patient
              | capital;
              | – the system of co-determination and;
              | – a style of management that is more driven by technological then by financial
              | aims (Jürgens et al. 2000: 59).
              | According to many observers the interplay of these institutions and attitudes led
              | to a considerable economic and social progress in post war Germany. Industrial
              | conflict was widely pacified by the redistribution policy of the state (especially in
              | funding adjustment measures) as well as by the specific construction of the
meta          | 7
text          | labour relations and vocational training systems. Thus the German labour
              | system keeps the typically severe conflicts about wages more or less out of the
              | companies and at the same time allows works councils to exert some influence
              | on the conditions of the use of labour (via a set of information, consultation and
              | co-determination rights). Also the vocational training system which is partly
              | financed by the state and which produces large numbers of skilled workers,
              | reflects a compromise between capital and work since it creates both company
              | specific skills (via the on the job training) as well as more general transferable
              | skills (via the training in vocational schools). Another important effect inherent to
              | the German model is its favouring of “high road” strategies. Next to the “patient
              | capital”, it is mainly the fact that short term cutting of labour costs is both rather
              | difficult and costly, that directs companies much more to strategies that aim at
              | an increase of productivity and quality, than to strategies that aim at price com-
              | petition.
              | On the shop floor, however, the general conditions of the German Model
              | such as the availability of skilled labour, a strong institutional backing of high
              | road strategies as well as rather pacified labour relations, did not in all cases
              | lead to a production concept other than the Fordist one, which is characterised
              | by centrally planned taylorized work. On the contrary, following the literature
              | review by Flecker/Schulten (1999: 86) as well as a review of some more recent
              | studies, there has always been and today still is a strong polarisation between
              | (1) certain industries such as the machine tool industry or the printing industry
              | where new concepts of work with a higher autonomy of the workers and a high
              | level of job sophistication exist and (2) other industries such as the automobile
              | and the clothing industry where low skill, Taylorist-Fordist production organisa-
              | tion prevails, with the effect of a strong under-utilisation of the existing skill base
              | (Pries et al. 1989 cited in Flecker/Schulten 1999, Kurz 1999, Springer 2000,
              | Nordhause-Janz/Prekuhl 2000). Enduring differences are also reported with
              | regard to shop floor employee representation. Here especially small (fewer than
              | 100 employees) and all larger firms differ a lot according to the existence or
              | respectively the effectiveness of shop floor employee representation. There are
              | both differences in the resources works councils can draw on (e.g. degree of
              | the exemption from the work for works council members, availability of outside
              | expertise, paid qualification), as well as differences in the level they are able
              | and “allowed” to fulfil their tasks as assigned by law (Dorsch-Schweizer/
              | Schulten 2001).3
              | An increase in the heterogeneisation of the German Model as a whole
              | occurred with the post-unification crisis in Germany and the flaring up of the
              | discussion about the competitiveness of Germany as a production location from
              | 3 Coping with these differences was one of the major aims of the spring 2001 reform of the
              | „Betriebsverfassungsgesetz“.

text          | 1992/3 on. Next to the growing importance of the stock markets in company
              | financing and a more commercial orientation of the management, the main
              | driving force here is the increased decentralisation of collective bargaining
              | (Flecker/Schulten 1999, Schroeder/Weinert 1999, Upchurch 2000). Decentrali-
              | sation of collective bargaining mainly occurs through the introduction of a vari-
              | ety of opening clauses to sectoral collective agreements, allowing for company
              | specific differentiation. While in the case of wage issues this development does
              | not necessarily lead to a greater heterogeneisation between the companies,4
              | this is obviously the case with regard to working time issues (cutting, enlarging
              | and flexibility of working time). All in all, a recent study undertaken by a German
              | trade union related institute (WSI), comes to the conclusion that the flexibility
              | inherent in this decentralisation has already resulted in strong differences in the
              | working and wage conditions in the same industry (Bispinck 2001).
              | Taking together the enduring differences according to the type of produc-
              | tion and the shop floor employee representation, as well as the more recent
              | tendency towards a decentralisation of collective bargaining, there is a consid-
              | erable scope of different industry or respectively company specific interpreta-
              | tions of the German Model (cf. figure 1).
              | Figure 1: The scope of industry/company specific interpretation of the German
              | Model
              | Strong adherence to

              | Low skill, Fordist type of
              | production
              | 4 This is due to the fact that it was quite usual in successful companies to pay more than the
              | collective agreement proposes. In recent times, however, the negotiations on the company
              | level are not about additional payments but about their freezing or reduction. Whether this
              | leads to a greater amount of harmonisation is difficult to say, since there is also evidence
              | that decentralised company level bargaining in troubled firms leads to regulations below the
              | standards of sectoral collective agreements (cf. Bispinck 2001).

              | Hungary as a Heterogeneous Location for Foreign Direct
              | Investments
              | Heterogeneity is not only restricted to the firm specific interpretation of the rele-
              | vant country of origin business system but refers also to regional differences in
              | host countries. As many other Central and East European countries, Hungary
              | shows strong regional inequalities with regard to different aspects that are cru-
              | cial for foreign investments. These include:
              | – labour market conditions (e.g. availability of a skilled workforce)
              | – infrastructure conditions (e.g. availability of transportation and communication
              | means and other economic structures such as related industries, business
              | services, sufficient housing conditions, cultural offers etc.) and
              | – industrial relations conditions (presence of trade unions, works councils, col-
              | lective bargaining structures).
              | It is widely maintained that Hungary is historically displaying a double divide
              | with regard to many aspects just mentioned. One split is between Budapest and
              | the larger provincial cities on the one hand and the small and medium sized
              | cities as well as the countryside on the other hand. This split, inherited from pre-
              | socialist times prevailed despite the egalitarian attitude of socialist regional pol-
              | icy and was aggravated due to the general decline of the agricultural sector in
              | the post socialist transition process (Cséfalvay et al. 1997). The second split is
              | between East Hungary and Central/West Hungary. Here especially the Buda-
              | pest region and the regions neighbouring the Austrian borders do possess a
              | much better infrastructure than the East. Taking a low unemployment rate as an
              | indicator for a work force, flexible enough to adjust to the transformation needs
              | during the 1990ies, again the Central region around Budapest as well as West-
              | ern Hungary are much more favourable to foreign investments than the Eastern
              | part of the country. Finally the heterogeneity of Hungary as an investment loca-
              | tion also relates to industrial relations conditions. Despite a generally low level
              | of regulation, the more modernized Central and Western parts of Hungary today
              | display a somewhat higher level of regulation, resulting from a stronger pres-
              | ence of trade unions and a more widespread existence of works councils (Toth
              | 1999, Kisgyörgy/Vámos 2001). Probably more important with regard to the
              | regional heterogeneity of Hungary as an investment location are the results
              | from the extremely individualized and decentralised Hungarian wage determi-
              | nation system (Neumann 2000). Here the local labour market performance is
              | playing a decisive role, with the labour markets in Central and West Hungary
meta          | 10
text          | being rather tight (and wages rather high) as a result of a strong concentration
              | of foreign direct investments in those regions.5

              | The Transfer of the German Industrial Model to Hungary
              | via FDI: Empirical Results
              | In line with the general trend, also German FDI have concentrated in the more
              | developed Central and Western region of Hungary. Taken as a whole Hungary
              | today is the seventh most attractive host country for German investments and
              | Germany is the single largest foreign investor in Hungary. German investments
              | in Hungary concentrate on a few industries such as electronics, automotive,
              | food beverage & tobacco, machinery and metal products. These five industries
              | account for approx. 60 percent of all German investments in Hungary (in terms
              | of foreign employment). Compared to the overall structure of German FDI,
              | Hungary is of specific importance for labour intensive industries such as apparel
              | and footwear production.
              | Out of a total sample of about 150 German investments in Hungary we
              | have selected 10 cases (cf. Table 1), for a closer examination of transfer
              | issues.6 These 10 cases represent to a large extend the main structural charac-
              | teristics of the total sample (Dörrenbächer et al. 2000b).7
              | 5 In 1999 unemployment was below 6 percent in Central (Country of Pest) and parts of West-
              | ern Hungary (Countries of Zala, Vas, Györ-Moson-Sopron) compared to 12 or more percent
              | in all eastern and most southern parts of the countries (OECD 2000: 113)
              | 6 These cases are based on interviews in the German headquarters and/or their Hungarian
              | subsidiary, that the author has conducted during October 2000 and March 2001. Most inter-
              | views were conducted together with Michael Wortmann. To make the cases anonymous was
              | not required by our interview partners. The existing provisional case studies will be inte-
              | grated into final case studies by different members of the project team (cf. footnote 1).
              | 7 Almost identical with the overall picture about 70% of the investors in the sample are small
              | and medium-sized companies; for about half of them the Hungarian subsidiary is the only
              | foreign production location. Again very close to the overall trend, three quarters of the cases
              | are acquisitions. Furthermore the sample comprises investments in all those industries,
              | where the amount of German investment is above their world-wide average (with the notable
              | exception of the food/beverage/tobacco industry). Only concerning the location of the in-
              | vestments the sample shows a slight weakness since investments in the developed Central
              | and Western region of Hungary are slightly underrepresented. Finally, next to large and
              | small Hungarian subsidiaries, the sample comprises strong export-oriented subsidiaries,
              | subsidiaries that mainly produce for the local market, as well as subsidiaries with a split
              | market orientation.

              | Transfer Intentions, Forms and Results
              | One of the most striking common features among the 10 cases is the fact that
              | almost all German MNCs intended a one-to-one transfer of all those aspects of
              | their industrial model that are related to technology, machinery, production and
              | work organisation (i.e. the production model). Usually the transfer of those
              | aspects was highly interconnected. Only in one rather exceptional case, where
              | the production technology as such was very outdated, the transfer only aimed at
              | the integration of a few machines and tools into an already existing production
              | site in Hungary (Wamsler-SVT).8
              | The transfer itself took several forms. In four of the cases studied, an exist-
              | ing plant or production line was built down in Germany, shipped to Hungary and
              | built up there (Balluff, FHP, März, Kübler). Of the same type, but somewhat dif-
              | ferent was the Siemens case. Here a production line for switching equipment
              | was build down at the Austrian switching plant of Siemens in Vienna and the
              | whole transfer to Hungary was managed by the Austrian subsidiary. In three
              | other cases (Salamander, Heidelberger Zement, Festo) the transfer occurred as
              | a strong modernisation and reorganisation of an existing production. Finally,
              | there was one case, where the investor, based on knowledge gained in Ger-
              | many over many decades, built up a totally new, state-of-the-art factory in Hun-
              | gary (Nordenia).
              | Unlike the well reported flagship case of German investments in Hungary,
              | the Audi-Györ case, where innovations for the whole Audi Group were clearly
              | intended (Kessel/Dörr 1998:2), our case studies revealed only weak intentions
              | to innovate with the investments in Hungary. There is only one case where the
              | investment was somewhat influenced by the possibility to get access to a new
              | product not produced before in the MNC (Festo) and another case where the
              | Hungarian subsidiary over the years gained some, however rather minor R&D
              | tasks for the whole MNC (Balluff). Process innovations were not at all intended
              | in our cases. Companies that used to apply a Fordist production (based on tay-
              | lorised work) in their (former) German production (such as Salamander or FHP)
              | did so in Hungary, too, and companies that followed more modern production
              | strategies in Germany such as flexible specialisation (incl. group work), did so in
              | Hungary, too (e.g. Nordenia, Balluff, Festo). Interestingly, especially the latter
              | companies can hardly be seen as purely transferring a German solution given
              | the many explicitly Japanese aspects such as Kanban or Kaizen, they have
              | incorporated (usually with the help of Japanese consultants) in their firm-
              | specific model.
              | 8 Wamsler-SVT is a rather exceptional case, since the Hungarian subsidiary (SVT) has taken
              | over its former minority shareholder (Wamsler) in November 2000.

text          | These rather conservative ideas and aims associated with the transfer of
              | the production model (i.e. technology, machinery, production and work organi-
              | sation) certainly reflect the large socio-economic gap between Germany and
              | Hungary as well as the conviction of some of our interview partners to run a
              | state-of-the-art, world class, factory. However, with regard to a few companies,
              | this tendency also reflects a strategy of “security first”, with transferring the firm-
              | specific production model one-to-one being “... the best way to control any kind
              | of catastrophe” (owner/manager of a German MNC). According to this interview
              | partner these “catastrophes” not only relate to transfer problems as such, but
              | also include labour disputes in Germany.
              | This refers to the question of transferring the German Model of labour prac-
              | tices (HRM and IR practices). Despite the fact that many of our interview part-
              | ners (from the management side) initially maintained that they had transferred
              | the German Model of HRM and IR practices, a closer examination showed a
              | rather different result. Thus, it turned out that in many cases the sheer existence
              | of a works council at the Hungarian affiliate and the strong desire of the man-
              | agement to transfer the German wage classification scheme were treated as
              | sufficient indicators for the German Model having been transferred. Indeed,
              | almost all companies in our sample aimed at such a transfer of the German
              | wage classification scheme to harmonise wage discrepancies within (and in
              | some cases between) individual wage groups in their Hungarian affiliates9. And
              | in nine out of the ten cases a works council exists at the Hungarian subsidiary.
              | However, only in two cases these works councils were considered strong
              | enough to really be a bargaining partner for the management. In all other cases
              | the works council was either installed with the help of the management, more or
              | less ignored, or only used to channel information into the workforce. In about
              | half of our cases unions were completely absent at the Hungarian subsidiaries
              | and sectoral collective bargaining did not occur at all. Collective bargaining at
              | the company level was reported for half of the companies. However, in most
              | cases these were rather informal talks on wages and not real bargaining proc-
              | esses. At the other half of the companies, wages and working conditions were
              | only subject of individual negotiations between each employee and the man-
              | agement.
              | Especially the last two points mentioned imply a strong depart from the
              | German Model of industrial relations. This depart is even stronger if we look at
              | some HRM practices: Trial and error employee selection, the use of leased
              | workers, frequent overtime or work on weekends are in almost all cases simply
              | management prerogatives, that are excessively used by some companies. All in
              | all there is a general tendency to not or only very selectively transfer the Ger-
              | 9 These are due to historical legacies and the different regional as well as historical labour
              | market conditions in Hungary.

text          | man Model of HRM and IR practices. This holds true despite the fact that there
              | are considerable differences among the cases. Confirming the results of Bluhm
              | (2001), large MNCs such as Siemens or Heidelberger Zement are following the
              | German path of labour relations in Hungary much more strictly than many small
              | German investors.10 This is also half true for those German companies, that
              | apply a high skill Post-Fordist production systems: While these companies relay
              | much more on skilled workers and invest a lot in training, this does not auto-
              | matically mean, that they also transfer their German IR practices to their Hun-
              | garian subsidiary.
              | Taken together German investors in Hungary seem to follow mixed inten-
              | tions with regard to their transfer policy. While German investors usually aim at
              | a one-to-one transfer of their firm specific production model11 (which is not nec-
              | essarily a German or a pure German one), they only rather selectively transfer
              | the German Model of labour practices. And they do so, even taking into account
              | the growing heterogeneity of HRM and IR practices in Germany. Thus all Hun-
              | garian affiliates in our case studies turned out to be hybrids, with a rather strong
              | but not exclusive German influence in technology, production and work organi-
              | sation and a rather strong Hungarian influence in HRM and IR practices.
              | 6.2.
              | Transfer Process
              | Looking at the transfer process, other differences become apparent. Especially
              | large firms with many (more or less comparable) subsidiaries all over the world
              | (such as Siemens or Heidelberger Zement) followed a very structured approach
              | towards the whole transfer process. Guided by a clear (sometimes codified)
              | transfer blueprint (including a strict time frame), the transfer process itself was
              | managed by an experienced multifunctional and multicultural team. Compared
              | to that, the transfer process at many of the smaller companies was much less
              | structured and relied more on the individual capacity of single expatriate man-
              | agers from the German investor, who in many cases were intrinsically motivated
              | either by a career step associated with the new task or because they are of
              | Hungarian descent or have other personal relationships to Hungary. Sometimes
              | managers from third companies were hired to carry out the transfer and to run
              | the Hungarian affiliate later-on.
              | While there was a common complaint, that there is a strong lack of local
              | management personnel, that complies with the expectations of the German
              | 10 However, whether this is a question of size, as argued by Bluhm (2001) and/or a question
              | of market orientation needs to be explored in greater detail.
              | 11 With regard to a few acquisitions, a one-to-one transfer was not feasible, due to existing
              | production means.

text          | investors (i.e. speaking German and having state-of-the-art management and/or
              | technical know how), notably different strategies were followed with regard to
              | local management personnel: Despite the skill gap, a few companies assigned
              | the local management a core role from the outset (e.g. Balluff, Heidelberger
              | Zement). Most investors, however, first trained local management personnel
              | (sometimes in a very structured way, e.g. at Siemens), that later took over the
              | tasks of the expatriate managers leaving. Finally, there were also a few cases
              | where the expatriates were and still are very dominant (e.g. Nordenia, FHP).
              | As a general rule, there was no or only weak training to prepare the expatri-
              | ates for their task in Hungary. Compared to that, the Hungarian management as
              | well as the Hungarian production workers got rather intensive training (whether
              | this was sufficient or not, is another question). Usually these efforts concentrate
              | on an on-the-job training at the German headquarter and/or at related factories
              | in the MNC. In many cases, these factories were not necessarily located in
              | Germany. E.g. in the Siemens case, all training took place in Austria. At Norde-
              | nia, machine workers from Hungary were sent to different affiliates all over the
              | world, depending on where a similar machine to the one in question in Hungary
              | had recently been installed. Training efforts also included on-the-job-training in
              | the Hungarian subsidiary carried out by personnel from the headquarters or
              | from other subsidiaries of the MNC, temporarily transferred to the Hungarian
              | plant. Finally, especially machine suppliers and to a somewhat lesser extent
              | consulting firms played an important role in transferring skills and knowledge to
              | Hungary. Both were not necessarily of German origin, too.
              | Almost all companies reported frequent emergency visits of headquarter
              | personnel (managers, technicians) at the beginning of their investments, and
              | later a decreasing or increasing intensity of headquarters presence at the Hun-
              | garian subsidiary, depending on the actual intensity of the transfer process, that
              | is usually carried out in a sequence of single transfer steps (or projects). This
              | sheds light on the fact that beyond a necessary minimum transfer, the floor is
              | open for different degrees regarding the “completeness” of the transfer. For
              | one, it is rather obvious that all companies who had (März) or still have more
              | than one factory of the same type in Hungary (Salamander, Heidelberger Ze-
              | ment) prefer to focus most of their transfer and investment efforts on one of
              | their Hungarian affiliates. Two, in some of our cases it was reported that the
              | very favourable cost structure of Hungary till 1996/1997 led to incomplete
              | transfers with regard to the level of efficiency and quality. With the worsening of
              | the international cost position of Hungary (no adequate devaluation of the Forint
              | compared to inflation for the last three years), especially companies, that aim at
              | low cost export production (such as Salamander or FHP, that are working under
              | the OPT regime) come under severe pressure, that will eventually either lead to
              | a "completion" of the transfer process, or to a relocation of the production out of
              | Hungary.

              | Conclusions
              | Unlike orthodox institutionalist thinking our empirical cases reveal that - keeping
              | both home and host country stable - there is still a lot of heterogeneity in
              | corporate internationalisation. Companies do vary with regard to what aspects
              | of their industrial model they transfer abroad, and to what extend these trans-
              | fers occur. In our empirical cases all companies aimed at a one-to-one-transfer
              | of their firm specific production model, and thus mirrored the heterogeneity
              | inherent in the German Model (e.g. with regard to the dichotomy of low skill,
              | Fordist type and high skill Post-Fordist type of production). Big differences how-
              | ever occurred concerning the export of their respective labour practices. Here it
              | turned out that only the rather large German MNCs and those (smaller) German
              | MNC, that assigned their Hungarian subsidiary a strategic role for the future of
              | the whole MNC, showed a tendency to strongly reproduce their home country
              | behaviour abroad (although the reproduction was far from being complete).
              | Furthermore some of our cases raise serious doubts about the question
              | whether all German MNCs transfer something like a German Model. Following
              | the long and intense debate about lean production, Kanban and the like, some
              | of the German firms studied, can hardly be seen as maintaining a pure German
              | industrial model, since many aspects thereof (with the notable exception of IR
              | practices) looked rather Japanese. Thus, there is already a hybridisation at the
              | source of the transfer. In addition, in some cases both the transfer of physical
              | assets as well as the transfer of knowledge did (sometime very systematically)
              | involve other than German units of the MNC in question, in some cases even
              | (foreign) organisations outside the MNC (such as machine suppliers or consul-
              | tancies undertaking training measures).
              | Finally there was also a striking heterogeneity in the quality of the transfer
              | process, with the large MNCs following a much more structured approach than
              | most of the small and medium sized MNCs. Despite the fact that in none of the
              | ten cases examined, the transfer really failed, it is obvious that in those cases
              | where the transfer process was rather chaotic and incomplete a higher risk for a
              | further relocation exists, with severe drawbacks for the Hungarian subsidiary
              | guaranteed and problems for the whole MNC (especially for the smaller ones)
              | being rather likely.
