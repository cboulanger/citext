              | Symptom diagnostics based on clinical
              | records
              | A tool for scientific research in child psychiatry?
              | j Abstract Introduction Child
              | psychiatric diagnoses are generally
              | based on a clinical examination
              | and not on standardized ques-
              | tionnaires. The present study
              | assessed whether symptom diag-
              | nostics based on clinical records
              | facilitates the use of non-stan-
              | dardized clinical material for re-
              | search. Method Six hundred and
              | eighty-ﬁve children, referred to a
              | third level child psychiatric centre
              | in the Netherlands, were, after
              | extensive multidisciplinary exam-
              | ination, classiﬁed according to the
              | multi-axial classiﬁcation scheme
              | for psychiatric disorders in child-
              | hood and adolescence (MAC-ICD-
              | 9). By two raters 44 behavioural
              | symptoms were scored based on
              | the clinical records of these chil-
              | dren. Interrater agreement on
              | symptoms in 50 records was per-
              | formed. Principal components
              | analysis on symptom scores of all
              | children was performed; factor
              | scores were related with MAC-
              | ICD-9 classiﬁcations. Results
              | Interrater reliability for behav-
              | ioural symptoms was excellent
              | (j = 0.88). Many children with
              | psychiatric problems suffer from a
              | large number of behavioural
              | symptoms. Factor scores of the
              | symptoms revealed recognizable
              | and well interpretable entities and
              | indicated overlap in symptom-
              | atology and comorbidity. Conclu-
              | sion A symptom-based diagnostic
              | approach based on extensive clin-
              | ical patient ﬁles may provide a
              | special dimension to improve the
              | reliability of psychiatric classiﬁca-
              | tion.

              | Introduction
              | The aim of psychiatric classiﬁcation is to facilitate
              | communication among medical professionals, care-
              | givers, educational experts, and people involved in a
              | patient’s treatment as well as use in scientiﬁc research
              | [1, 18]. The classiﬁcation of a patient’s disorder is based
              | on thorough clinical investigation which increasingly
              | relies on structured diagnostic interviews and ques-
              | tionnaires. The use of structured diagnostic interviews
              | can improve reliability and consistency of classiﬁca-
              | tion. The advantage of questionnaires is standardiza-
              | tion [16, 18]. However questionnaires often focus on
              | speciﬁc types of disturbances, such as anxiety,
              | depression, or bipolar diseases. Another objection EC
              | encountered in the use of questionnaires is that often P

              | child’s behaviour has different information about the
              | child and knowledge of child psychiatry [17, 18]. The
              | use of clinical classiﬁcations also has an inherent dis-
              | advantage due to variable reliability, particularly in
              | regard to disorders, where interrater reliability varies
              | from moderate to excellent: for example reliability is
              | good to excellent for ADHD and separation anxiety, fair
              | for generalized anxiety and obsessive compulsive dis-
              | order (OCD) and conduct disorder (CD) [16, 21, 24].
              | This variability in reliability can partially be explained
              | by the overlap of symptomatology in diverging clinical
              | psychiatric syndromes and by comorbidity [2, 3, 6, 9,
              | 21, 23]. In classiﬁcation, this may lead to differences of
              | interpretation, for example in the principle diagnosis.
              | To evaluate the suitability of clinical material for use in
              | research we explored whether symptom scoring on the
              | basis of non-standardized clinical material is feasible
              | and may be interpreted in terms of clinical diagnosis. In
              | research the addition of dimensional elements in clas-
              | siﬁcation systems is becoming progressively more
              | important [4, 12, 13, 18, 19]. Dimensional elements may
              | help to distinguish differences in individual disorder
              | severity and clinically signiﬁcant features subsumed by
              | other disorders [4, 11, 14]. They also can help deter-
              | mine comorbidity and overlap of symptomatology.
              | Our study was conducted in the framework of a
              | larger study on neurobehavioral relationships in
              | children with psychiatric morbidity. Its aim was to
              | investigate whether it is possible to improve insight
              | into the structure and value of child psychiatric
              | classiﬁcations with the help of additional scoring of
              | symptoms noted in the clinical record. To this end we
              | assessed the clinical records of 705 children who were
              | referred to a centre for child and adolescent psychi-
              | atry in the Netherlands.
              | The following research questions were investi-
              | gated:
              | 1. Is it possible to score psychiatric symptoms reli-
              | ably on the basis of carefully recorded, but non-
              | standardized clinical material?
              | 2. Assuming this were possible, does principal com-
              | ponents analysis of the symptoms reveal the
              | presence of clinically recognizable and reliably
              | interpretable entities?

              | psychiatric centre ‘‘Symfora Group’’ in Amersfoort,
              | the Netherlands. Table 1 presents the signiﬁcant
              | demographic characteristics of the children. Approx-
              | imately three quarters of them were boys (73%). The
              | majority (98%) were aged between 4 and 12 years old,
              | averaging 9.0 years (SD ±2.05). Thirty-nine percent
              | were in special education programs.
              | j Procedure
              | All children were examined according to standard
              | diagnostic procedures by a team consisting of a child
              | psychiatrist (MdJ), a psychologist/physical therapist
              | (JMP), a family therapist, a psychotherapist, and a
              | play therapist, each of whom was assigned speciﬁc
              | tasks. The standard diagnostic program consisted of
              | history taking, including developmental history and a
              | parental report, family diagnostics, child psychiatric
              | and neuropsychiatric examination, and the gathering
              | of relevant prior diagnostic data and school infor-
              | mation. Members of the diagnostic team were careful
              | to assess the children with an open mind and to avoid
              | jumping to clinical conclusions. This means that signs
              | and symptoms were recorded even if they do not
              | belong primarily to a speciﬁc psychiatric disorder.
              | If indicated, the standard diagnostic program was
              | supplemented with other examinations, such as
              | psychodiagnostic assessments, speciﬁc educational
              | assessments, occupational therapeutic assessments,
              | supplementary medical examinations. All examina-
              | tions were recorded in detail in written form. The
              | ﬁnal diagnoses were established by consensus in a

              | mation. This resulted in a classiﬁcation according to
              | MAC-ICD-9 (multi-axial classiﬁcation scheme for
              | psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence
              | [7, 20]), the child psychiatric adaptation of the ICD-9
              | (International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, version 9,
              | World Health Organization [21]). For the classiﬁca-
              | tion of dyslexia as a clinical psychiatric syndrome, the
              | DSM-IV (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental
              | disorders, American Psychiatric Association [1]) was
              | used, since the MAC-ICD-9 does not classify this as a
              | clinical psychiatric syndrome on Axis I, but as a
              | speciﬁc developmental disorder on Axis II. The
              | diagnostic assessment procedure for children referred
              | for dyslexia was identical to that of the other children.
              | To assess child psychiatric symptoms, we devel-

              | psychiatric syndrome (Axis I), to which we added
              | speciﬁc (Axis II) developmental disorders (e.g.,
              | developmental dyslexia, motor retardation). This list
              | consisted of 44 items (Table 2), presented in random
              | order. Two researchers (TH and MS), who were blind
              | to the child’s ﬁnal diagnostic description and clinical
              | classiﬁcation and whose information about each child
              | was restricted to the information in the clinical re-
              | cord, scored each item on a three-point scale (‘‘not
              | applicable’’, ‘‘somewhat or sometimes applicable’’,
              | ‘‘distinctly or often applicable’’) on the basis of
              | diagnostic data from patient ﬁles. Six hundred and
              | eighty-ﬁve ﬁles could be assessed in this way; the
              | other 20 ﬁles were no longer available. To determine
              | interrater reliability of symptom scores, 50 of total
              | 685 ﬁles were selected at random and scored by both
              | researchers separately.
              | j Statistical analysis
              | Interrater reliability for the 44 items of the symptom
              | list was, due to their ordinal level of measurement,
              | determined by square-weighted Cohen’s kappa [5].
              | Kappa’s were calculated by the statistical package
              | AGREE, version 7.002, and were interpreted accord-
              | ing to Landis and Koch [15].
              | The interrelationships of the symptoms were
              | investigated by principal components analysis (PCA)
              | with Varimax-rotation. The median standardized
              | factor score of each symptom was compared to the
              | MAC-ICD-9 clinical psychiatric syndromes, using the
              | Kruskal–Wallis test. This non-parametric test was
              | chosen since the non-homogeneity of the variances
              | did not allow for a parametric test. Post hoc com-
              | parisons were made by using the method described by
              | Siegel and Castellan [22].
              | PCA and Kruskal–Wallis test were performed by
              | use of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences
              | (SPSS), version 12.1. Results were considered statis-
              | tically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.
              | Results
              | j Prevalence of clinical psychiatric syndromes
              | The prevalence of the clinical psychiatric syndromes
              | in the study population (n = 685), listed MAC-ICD-9
              | order, was:
              | • Autistic disorders (n = 120; 18%); in this context
              | autistic disorders includes all disorders in the aut-
              | ism spectrum
              | • Neurotic disorders (n = 54; 8%)
              | • Adjustment disorders (n = 89; 13%)
              | • Disturbance of emotions speciﬁc to childhood and
              | adolescence (n = 210; 31%)
              | • Hyperkinetic disorders (n = 54; 8%)
              | • Disturbance of conduct not elsewhere classiﬁed
              | (n = 76; 11%), henceforth referred to as CDs
              | • Special symptoms or syndromes not elsewhere
              | classiﬁed (tics, stuttering, disorders of eating,
              | etcetera) (n = 30; 4%)
              | • Dyslexia (n = 44; 6%); not mentioned as psychiat-
              | ric syndrome on Axis I in the MAC-ICD-9, but as a
              | speciﬁc disorder in development on Axis II
              | • No psychiatric diagnosis (n = 8; 1%); no child
              | psychiatric problems were found after child psy-
              | chiatric assessment.
              | j Prevalence of symptoms
              | The prevalence of each symptom is shown in Table 2.
              | In 20% of children, eight or fewer symptoms were
              | identiﬁed, in 33%, nine to 12 symptoms, in 30%, 13 to
              | 16 symptoms, in 16%, 17 or more symptoms.
              | j Interrater reliability of symptom scoring
              | The mean kappa of items in the psychiatric symptom
              | list was 0.88 (Table 2). Interrater reliability was
              | very good’ for 32 items (j > 0.80), good’ for six
              | items (0.66 < j £ 0.80) and moderate’ for one item
              | (hypoactivity; j = 0.54). The Cohen’s kappa for ﬁve
              | infrequent symptoms could not be determined, but
              | both assessors had high levels of agreement; on two of
              | the ﬁve items both assessors scored 0’, for three
              | items, one assessor consistently scored 0’, the other
              | scored 1’ once.
              | j Principal component analysis of the symptoms
              | Six symptoms which were scored in less than 2% of
              | the children were not included in PCA: brief
              | depressive reaction’, socialised disturbance of con-
              | duct’, mild or transient disturbance of conduct’,
              | elective mutism’, trichotillomania’ and compulsive
              | CDs’.
              | PCA was performed for the remaining 38 symp-
              | toms in 677 subjects (in eight subjects one or more
              | symptoms was missing). PCA produced 12 Eigen-
              | values greater than unity. The scree-plot however
              | indicated that the elbow of the plot, which separates
              | the most important factors, was situated after six
              | factors. Therefore, and for reasons of interpretation,
              | we chose the six-factor solution. The six factors
              | combined explained 37.4% of the total variance. Ro-
              | tated factor loadings greater than 0.3 and the variance

              | less than 0.3 on each of the six extracted factors:
              | stuttering’ and adjustment reaction with predomi-
              | nant disturbance of other emotions as anxiety, fear or
              | worry’. Six items had factor loadings greater than 0.3
              | on two factors.
              | The following six factors were extracted: (1) a
              | factor, we call autistic symptoms, isolated the symp-
              | toms of the autistic disorders except psychosis’. Also
              | isolated were stereotyped repetitive movements’,
              | excessive reactions on environmental stimuli’ and
              | developmental speech/language disorders’. (2) On the
              | second factor, called disorders in attention, activity
              | and conduct, three symptoms of hyperkinetic disor-
              | ders and three symptoms of CDs had high loadings.
              | (3) The factor emotional disabilities had high loadings
              | of three items of disturbance of emotions speciﬁc to
              | childhood and adolescents, plus negativism’, lasting
              | depression’, hypoactivity’ and bodily complaints’.
              | (4) The factor anxiety and OCD isolated four items of

              | other MAC-ICD-9 syndromes. Children classiﬁed as
              | having a hyperkinetic disorder or as having a CD
              | according to MAC-ICD-9 scored signiﬁcantly higher
              | on factor two, disorders in attention, activity, and
              | conduct, than children with most other MAC-ICD-9
              | syndromes. The difference was substantially greater
              | for hyperkinetic disorders than for CDs. Children
              | with dyslexia and those with the clinical psychiatric
              | syndrome hyperkinetic disorders scored signiﬁcantly
              | higher on factor ﬁve, learning disabilities with deﬁcits
              | in attention and motor control, than children with
              | other MAC-ICD-9 clinical psychiatric syndromes. The
              | relationship between the other three factor scores and
              | MAC-ICD-9 classiﬁcations was less speciﬁc.
              | Discussion
              | The present study indicates that it is possible to score
              | psychiatric symptoms reliably from clinical mate-
              | rial collected in a non-standardized way. Principal
              | components analysis of the symptoms yielded well
              | interpretable, clinically recognizable entities with
              | reasonable correspondences to the clinical psychiatric
              | syndromes. It also illustrated the existence of a sub-
              | stantial amount of overlap in symptomatology and
              | comorbidity.
              | j Methodological considerations
              | It might be considered a weak point that we used the
              | MAC-ICD-9 instead of more recently developed
              | classiﬁcation systems such as the DSM-IV for the
              | classiﬁcation of clinical syndromes. The use of this
              | older system is due to the fact that the project started
              | in 1984. We considered continued use of the MAC-
              | ICD-9 classiﬁcation system more reliable than a mid-
              | course change in the classiﬁcation system, since
              | conversion of the oldest data to another system would
              | have entailed the loss of information. An additional
              | argument to continue with the MAC-ICD-9 was that
              | in our opinion more recent systems initially paid less
              | attention to the child’s developmental and environ-
              | mental variables does than the MAC-ICD-9.
              | MAC-ICD-9 was also used to generate the list of
              | the most prevalent child psychiatric symptoms. The
              | use of the most prevalent symptoms implies that the
              | list is not profuse. This underscores the notion that
              | the present symptom list cannot replace clinical
              | diagnostics and classiﬁcation. In addition, it should
              | be noted that rarely occurring symptoms such as
              | trichotillomania’, elective mutism’, gambling and
              | stealing’, and disturbance of social conduct’ were not
              | included in PCA.
              | It is also noteworthy that symptoms belonging to
              | the MAC-ICD-9 clinical syndrome of adjustment
              | disorders were scored infrequently. Possibly the pa-
              | tient ﬁles did not provide sufﬁcient information about

meta          | 263
text          | temporary aspects of the adjustment disorder. The
              | most likely explanation is that the signs of malad-
              | justment were interpreted as mild signs of other dis-
              | orders, such as emotional disorder.
              | A limitation of the PCA based on symptoms noted
              | in clinical records is that any bias in the clinically
              | collected information is by deﬁnition transferred to
              | the relevant clinical symptom association. In other
              | words, a PCA based on symptoms noted in clinical
              | records cannot be compared to PCA based on indi-
              | cations derived from standardized and unbiased
              | questionnaires.
              | Symptom diagnostics, like other dimensional
              | approaches, have the limitation that symptoms only
              | are a part of the expression of the childhood psy-
              | chopathology, so it can never replace a classiﬁcation
              | system in which all aspects of development, somatic
              | conditions, family history and genetics are taken into
              | account.
              | The strength of the present study is the study
              | population, which was not a selected university hos-
              | pital population, but consisted of a large number of
              | children referred to a regional centre for child psy-
              | chiatry. This implies that our population can be
              | considered a reliable representation of the general
              | psychiatric population. In addition, our data were not
              | based on behavioural information collected by means
              | of questionnaires, but on extensive child psychiatric
              | diagnostics, including an interview. Hartman et al.
              | [10] demonstrated that information based on a psy-
              | chiatric interview is considerably more reliable than
              | that those based on questionnaires.
              | j Practical implications
              | Symptom diagnostics provide information about the
              | presence or absence of psychopathology and about
              | the degree to which psychopathology manifests itself
              | in the individual patient. Our study indicated that
              | many children with psychiatric problems suffer from
              | a large number of symptoms. This may explain why
              | diagnostics at the clinical classiﬁcation level is difﬁ-
              | cult and relatively unreliable. It also reﬂects the
              | comorbid nature of childhood psychiatric disorders.
              | The data on the relationships between the MAC-
              | ICD-9 clinical syndromes and the symptom based
              | factor scores nicely illustrated two phenomena which
              | complicate diagnostics in children with psychiatric
              | morbidity, i.e. criterion overlap (the fact that similar
              | symptoms are used for the classiﬁcation of differ-
              | ent syndromes) and comorbidity. For example, our
              | ﬁndings indicated that children with hyperkinetic
              | disorders often had problems in motor control in
              | combination with learning disabilities. The combi-
              | nation of hyperkinetic disorder and problems in
              | motor control is well known and referred to in the
              | literature as deﬁcits in attention, motor control, and
              | perception (DAMP [8]).
              | The results also demonstrated that factor scores
              | autistic symptoms (factor 1), disorders in attention,
              | activity and conduct (factor 2) and learning disabili-
              | ties with deﬁcits in attention and motor control (factor
              | 5) corresponded strongly to their related clinical
              | psychiatric syndromes. Factor scores emotional dis-
              | abilities (factor 3), anxiety and obsessive compulsive
              | disorders (factor 4), and functional disorders (factor 6)
              | were less speciﬁc for a MAC-ICD-9 classiﬁcation. One
              | possible explanation for this ﬁnding is that the MAC-
              | ICD-9 classiﬁcation system, from which all of the
              | symptoms are derived, includes many mixed disor-
              | ders hallmarked by comorbidity [16]. The substantial
              | degree of criterion overlap, the fact that clinical psy-
              | chiatric syndromes are insufﬁciently discriminating,
              | and the presence of comorbidity we consider to be
              | important contributing factors to the variability in
              | interrater reliability in child psychiatric classiﬁcation.
              | Factors such as referral bias and speciﬁc features of
              | the clinician (i.e. education level, experience, work
              | setting) and the variance in sources of information
              | about the child also play a part in this process. The
              | variability in interrater reliability for the classiﬁcation
              | of different clinical psychiatric syndromes is cause
              | for concern, particularly since governmental and
              | institutional policies are increasingly based on these
              | classiﬁcations.
              | j Concluding remarks
              | The present study indicated that diagnostic material,
              | as acquired by an extensive, systematic diagnostic
              | process, and elaborately documented in patient ﬁles,
              | is suitable for evaluation by third party assessors and
              | therefore for scientiﬁc research. Scoring of problem-
              | atic behaviour as symptoms on the basis of diagnostic
              | material has turned out to be possible with a high
              | level of reliability. Symptom diagnostics based on
              | extensively documented patient ﬁles of careful, but
              | non-standardized child psychiatric assessments sup-
              | port the reliability of classiﬁcation by addition of a
              | special dimension to classiﬁcation. Hence our study
              | suggests that for child psychiatric research, this
              | symptom-based dimensional diagnostic approach
              | is a strengthening tool. The dimensional approach
              | highlights the overlap in symptomatology and of

              | severity of individual psychopathology, and thereby
              | on the impact on the child’s social environment. In
              | turn, improved insight has implications for treatment.
              | However, symptom diagnostics cannot replace clini-
              | cal diagnostics in child psychiatry.
