              | 1989, the ‘others’ of Europe and some implications
              | for a political Europe

              | Abstract
              | An enlarged EU might be structurally integrated, but the ways in which pre-1989 EU
              | members used to imagine their counterparts during the Cold War period have profoundly
              | influenced the ways in which ‘east’ Europe has been and still is thought nowadays (hence
              | the remaining ideational divergences within a political Europe). The paper argues that
              | European construction and pos-1989 enlargement of the EU towards East imply a form of
              | subtle and untold domination of the Western part of the continent subtlety and at times
              | unconsciously by institutions of the EU or by academic discourses on Central and Eastern
              | Europe. Such domination, as an unintended consequence, is best explored on the
              | ideational level and through the central role that 1989 has taken in this process.
              | Discussing slope-metaphors and allochronisms in the field of a European common
              | memory, this paper shows how artificial distances are created between Eastern and
              | Western Europe. By combining allochronism and heteronomy, we have coined the new
              | term of ‘heterochrony’ to express the situation in which a given group does not have the
              | capacity of choosing its own laws and the cognitive means to think of itself and where such
              | situation is due to reasons of different time location (in that case in a backward situation)
              | than other autonomous groups. Such heterochrony might lead to a halt of transnational
              | cooperation in Europe and have negative impacts on the self-perception of Europe.

text          | 1. Introduction: Othering process, cognitive means and time.
              | We will discuss in this paper the view that the enlarged European Union we now live in and
              | which we intellectually perceive is as much the direct result of 1989 than it is of the efforts to create
              | the first European Communities in the 1950s. The breaking apart of the Communist block ushered
              | in a new era for a political Europe where positive features (EU enlargement commenced in 1995 by
              | incorporating the hitherto ‘neutral’ states of Austria, Finland and Sweden, not to mention the 2004
              | and 2007 enlargements) coexist with more problematic ones (unsolved security agreements between
              | the EU and Russia, some occidentalist reductionist ways of describing Eastern Europe in urgent
              | need to catch up with (Western) Europe, or the stumbling bocks still existing between East and
              | West on the debate of a common European memory). One could say that 1989 ‘made’ Europe, but
              | in an imperfect manner. So, what has been the impact of European integration on 1989? Prior
              | western European integration facilitated and legitimated, it may be surmised, the notion of a ‘return
              | to Europe’ voiced by the dissidents and revolutionaries in the Soviet bloc as well as the
              | Gorbachevian notion of a Common European Home. Yet, how was the transformation of Europe
              | after 1989 constrained and enabled by the pre-existence of a common western political project?
              | 1989 ‘made’ Europe because what was hitherto a divided continent now became united.
              | More specifically, the revolutions of 1989 brought in their wake German unity. Negotiations
              | regarding German unification and the integration of this new Germany into western structures were
              | to change fundamentally the reality and the idea of Europe. One could say that Germany epitomizes
              | the problem of an enlarged Europe Union to 27 members: by incorporating the eastern part into the
              | western part of the FRG, the historical experience and identity of the GDR tended to be written off
              | and to disappear (and quite symptomatically, they are dubbed the ‘new’ Länder so as to insist that
              | things had be started anew there) based on the assumption that they had little, or simply nothing to
              | offer to the western experience or ways of doing politics and of imagining itself.
              | We will argue that a same phenomenon has happened between EU15 (western Europe) and
              | the new 12 EU member states: 15+12 may have created an enlarged EU that is now indeed
              | structurally integrated (or in the continuous process of complete integration), but the ways in which
              | EU15/West Germany used to imagine their/its counterpart(s) during the Cold War period have
              | profoundly influenced the ways in which ‘east’ Europe has been and still is thought nowadays
              | (hence the ideational divergences that this conference tries to tackle). Put differently, the process of
              | ideational convergence that EU enlargement should have carried through and fulfilled in the period
              | 1989-2004 was profoundly and negatively affected by an occidentalist bias in which the
              | GDR/Eastern Europe was thought not on the basis of its own merit, features or characteristics but as
              | the negative Other of an integrating Western Europe. ‘Othering’ mechanisms most frequently
              | contribute to simplifications and negative stereotypes, and this paper will discuss some of these
              | mechanisms and their consequences in the power relation between eastern and western Europe. Of
              | interest for us here will be the case of collective memory around European themes, political
              | contributions to a European acquis and questions of collective autonomy, and how 1989 has been a
              | turning point in such problematic mutual perceptions between Eastern and Western Europe. The
              | paper will not discuss the institutional arrangements of post-1989 EU life but dwells at length on
              | ideational and cognitive issues for two reasons. One because ‘Europe’ (as a political project) needs
              | to rethink itself if it wants to be more inclusive and more democracy-friendly (the self-reflective
              | dimension of Europe). Second, because for individuals and state to feel as fully equals within the
meta          | 3
text          | European realms need not just to have the same access to EU institutions but should also have equal
              | access to cognitive means1 (the capacity of auto-institution on the cognitive level).
              | Of central concern in this paper is the study of certain discourses articulated around deep
              | differences between East/West and favoring dichotomous understanding of Europe. We will try to
              | understand why such discourses occur, what are their meanings and discuss some of their examples,
              | a famous illustration being that of Norman Davies when he dissects the division ‘East and West
              | Europe’. In that perspective (and in his critique the occidentalistic-cum-orientalistic framework)
              | Norman Davies shows how the famous curriculum course on ‘Western Civilisation’ introduces
              | sloppy reasoning and judgemental dualisms of the following kind:
              | 1. That the western and eastern halves of Europe are separate entities with little or nothing in
              | common.
              | 2. That Eastern Europe is not really part of Europe, or not part of ‘the real Europe’.
              | 3. That the East-West division of Europe, which can be observed in different manifestations at
              | different times, is fixed and permanent.
              | 4. That ‘the West’ is superior.
              | 5. That all summaries of Western civilisation / European history can safely omit anything which
              | belongs to the different and inferior East. (The only exception to this rule is Russia, which,
              | being powerful, automatically qualifies for inclusion.) (Davies 2006: 60).
              | This type of idea is also somehow embedded in much of the political science literature dealing with
              | democratization and civil society promotion. There, one can find similar biases simply in the fact
              | that ‘transition’ has to be managed from outside by western donors (instead of counting on local
              | forces), or that civil society often has to be constructed and engineered into the right type of
              | political participation (rather than leaving the existing institution choosing their own course of
              | action and rhetoric to do so).2
              | Attila Melegh, in a recent stimulant book, questions also such dualisms and argues that an
              | East-West slope runs across the self-perception of Europe. This slope implies a sense of normative
              | judgment where the west is the positive endpoint of the slope (embodied by a liberal humanitarian
              | utopia) that easterners of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are supposed to climb to reach
              | ‘freedom’, ‘democracy’, ‘market economy’ and the like, while on the lower end, an abnormal East
              | is trailing behind in a state of ‘backwardness’ in which the legacy of the past or ‘incomplete
              | nationalisms’3 weighs heavily (Melegh 2006: 1-3). Melegh’s point is obviously not to ‘measure’ at
              | which points various countries, institutions or individuals are positioned onto this slope, but “is
              | rather how these ‘East-West slopes’ based on the idea of diminishing civilization toward the ‘East’
              | enable the translations of ‘liberal humanitarian utopias’ onto a global scale and how the related
              | identity structures actually operate and transform themselves into social and political action or
              | individual narratives in the context of Central and Eastern Europe” (ibid: 2). In other words this
              | imaginary slope has a constitutive role in the self-perception and self-understanding of people of
              | and involved with Central and Eastern Europe.
              | We will argue in this paper that European construction (around the EU, alternatively referred
              | to as ‘Europe’ as oppose to Europe, the geographical space independent of the political Union) and
              | enlargement of the EU towards East imply a form of subtle and untold domination of the Western
              | 1 I draw here inspiration on the work of Castoriadis for whom autonomy is not just a political autonomy a la Rousseau,
              | but also the capacity to choose its cognitive means to do so (Castoriadis 1986, 1997 and 1999). We will develop later
              | this point in the part dealing with heterochrony. See in particular Section 3.b.
              | 2 For a critique of this Promothean conception of democracy and civil society promotion which does not consider
              | enough local resources and that has negative social effects, see, e.g., Hann & Dunn (1997) and Mendelson (2002).
              | 3 For an overview of the alleged defect of Eastern European nationalisms, see Todorova (2005).

text          | part of the continent subtlety and at times unconsciously by institutions of the EU or by academic
              | discourses on Central and Eastern Europe. Such domination, bordering at times with coloniality4 as
              | an unintended consequence, is best explored on the ideational level and through the central role that
              | 1989 has taken in this process. That there was a relation of power between the EU and (soon to be)
              | candidate Eastern European states in the period 1989-2004 is out of doubt (one just needs to think
              | of the Copenhagen criteria to respect in order to become part of the club). The sub-hypotheses we
              | are exploring here is that domination is not a conscious fact but a consequence of institutional
              | practices rooted in a European community born during the Cold War and of certain academic
              | devices reinforcing divides between social groups (in our case, the ‘east’ and the ‘west’). In this
              | process, 1989 plaid a particular role by leaving a lasting imprint on official discourses on Eastern
              | Europe and influenced by a reading of Communism having atomized and destroyed all positive
              | constitutive elements in Eastern Europe that had no other issue but to catch up and emulate the
              | western ways of doing.
              | Such view can be found elsewhere nowadays in some of the debates about a European
              | memory and historical representation of Europe. To advance a metaphor, we could say that on the
              | theme of European memory and identity, there is a sort of East-West slope running across the
              | continent where, e.g. Eastern Europe still needs to come to term with the Holocaust and still needs
              | to do some work on its collective history with regard to the extermination of Jews.5 We argue that
              | there is a slope here as well, because differences in the Vergangenheitsbewältigungen tend to be
              | expressed not only in normative term (‘they must come to term with this problem’, or ‘they have
              | not done their homework’, etc.), but also in terms of different time locations (‘they are trailing back
              | on the work on memory, etc). Johannes Fabian, in his important albeit little quoted work on Time
              | and the Other (1983), underlines that one of the favorite ways for anthropology to ‘make its
              | objects’ is through time and what he terms ‘denial of coevalness’ (Fabian 1983: 32) or
              | ‘allochronism’ (from the Greek ‘allos’ for ‘other, and ‘xronos’ for time). Allochronism could be
              | defined as the (usually forced) positioning of one’s group in a different time than that of the
              | reference group. His thesis is that “anthropology has emerged and established itself as an
              | allochronic discourse; it is a science of other men in another Time. It is a discourse whose referent
              | has been removed from the present of the speaking/writing subject” (ibid.: 143).
              | Although Fabian criticizes the discipline of anthropology (for its contribution to the
              | realization of colonialism), his arguments runs parallel to that of Melegh, when the former sustains
              | that anthropology “promoted a scheme in terms of which not only past cultures, but all living
              | societies were irrevocably placed on a temporal slope, a stream of Time—some upstream, others
              | downstream. Civilization, evolution, development, acculturation, modernization (and their cousins,
              | industrialization, urbanization) are all terms whose conceptual content devices, in ways that can be
              | specified, from evolutionary time” (Fabian 1983: 17). The problem with such allochronism and
              | slope-metaphor is not that they ascribe people definitively to a certain place, or position on the scale
              | of civilization or of Erinnerungsarbeit, but that they create artificial distances between different
              | groups and that they ‘otherize’ given social groups. They put certain groups in a more active (the
              | one judging the time location and deciding of the allochronism) or passive stance (the group lagging
              | behind6). The negative results for the group at a lower end of such othering process and delineation
              | 4 Melegh defines colonialty as “a system of power understood as a complex form of domination, including the
              | hierarchical classification of the populations of the planet, the reformulation of local concepts of space and time, the
              | export of sexual energies into the ‘East’, the ‘imperial gaze’ and most importantly the colonization of consciousness.
              | The latter point can be summed up as ‘an energy and a machinery to transform differences into values’ and as the
              | consequence ‘subalternization of knowledge and societies” (Melegh 2006: 29. His emphasis).
              | 5 See Troebst’s seminal papers (2005, 2006 and 2007) on that matter.
              | 6 Todorova (2005: 163f) also uses the concept of allochronism with regard to a certain analysis of the temporalities of
              | Eastern European nationalisms.

text          | process between active/passive, modern/traditional is first that, as Melegh argues, it affects the self-
              | understanding of such people leading to discriminatory or racist views, and second that it
              | disempowers them putting them in a situation of heteronomy7. By combining allochronism and
              | heteronomy, we have coined the new term of ‘heterochrony’ to express the situation in which a
              | given group does not have the capacity of choosing its own laws and the cognitive means to think
              | of itself and where such situation is due to reasons of different time location (in that case in a
              | backward situation) than other autonomous groups. Let us see now how such theme can be found in
              | the post-1989 phase, how this has become an institutional problem and how it relates to the question
              | of European memory.
              | 2. Three questions on 1989, Europe: Directions and Pluralities
              | If there was an impact of 1989 on European ‘integration’8, there is probably also some
              | reflections to gain from the following reversed question: What has been the impact of European
              | integration on 1989? In other words, has the transformation of a post-1989 eastern Europe been
              | constrained by the pre-existence of a common western political project, west of the Iron Curtain? If
              | so, how? To give short answers to this question, we will resort to three sub-questions.
              | The first question: Has there been an impact of 1989 on European Integration? If so, of
              | what kind? This is well beyond the scope of this paper, and 1989 surely had a variety of impacts on
              | European integration and European societies at large. A short answer, easier to give now that the
              | 2004 and 2007 enlargements took place is that the collapse of Iron Curtain has allowed the entry of
              | former communist as well as some neutral countries into the EEC/EU. 1989 has, in a way, given a
              | new impetus towards a revamped and enlarged common ‘European House’ (to take the phrase of
              | Gorbatchov). But why was it that ‘Europe’ became the roof for integration of a post-1989 eastern
              | Europe? This leads us to the second question.
              | What has been the impact of European integration on 1989? The response, though
              | seemingly tautological, is simply another wave of ‘European integration’, yet of another kind. Since
              | the EEC was one of the most effective supra-national political institutions at the time of the collapse
              | of the Soviet empire, the model of European integration provided a direct blueprint or a clear
              | horizon for eastern Europe (hence the (problematic) notion shared by many that there was a ‘return
              | to Europe’). The process is what is referred to in neo-institutionalist parlance as a case of path-
              | dependency. Once the project of an effective European community was re-launched in the 1980s
              | and that political momentum was given towards further integration by the 1987 Single Act, the
              | existing and already expanding European institution was the natural candidate at the time of the
              | Soviet collapse to preside over renewed collaboration between East and West. Other ‘pan-
              | European’ institutions existed and mattered already back then, like NATO, Conference for Security
              | and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Council of Europe, but since the post-1989 task
              | included also the question of German re-unification (a still very sour point to many European states
              | back in 1989, and an issue that had driven a decisive wedge in the East-West relationship in the
              | 7 To define heteronomy, we will tap again into the work of Castoriadis. Autonomy, as pointed earlier, is the capacity to
              | choose its own laws and the cognitive means to do so. An autonomous society is one that has the capacity of auto-
              | institution, that is the capacity for societies to openly ‘call into question their own institution, their representation of the
              | world, their social imaginary significations’ (Castoriadis 1997: 17).
              | In an heteronymous society, there is no capacity to choose its laws and/or there is closure on the cognitive level. By
              | closure Castoriadis means that a given society does not have the possibilities to choose the ways and means in which
              | they reflect about themselves. Closure implies the law of others imposed on this society.
              | 8 The term ‘integration’ would be discussing since it is highly contentious. For a discussion of the term ‘integration’ see
              | the work on US-influence on the first steps of European construction in Winand (1993) and Aldrich (1997).

              | political forum with binding supra-national powers and in which the USA could have a say.9 NATO
              | could not be such a forum (because of its military nature and the reluctance of the Soviet Union/CIS
              | to abandon all of its sphere of influence—although NATO was also part of the discussion back in
              | 1989, as much as it is still part of the problem in Europe now if one just looks at the stand off
              | between Russia and Europe on the question of Georgia this Summer), while the Council of Europe
              | and the CSCE (transformed in 1994 into the OSCE) were only too loose inter-governmental
              | institutions to be able to decide on such important matters. Moreover, as observes Delcour (2008),
              | by the time of the Wall collapse, the EEC was already engaged in managing a flow of aid to Poland
              | and Hungary and therefore the EEC was the natural candidate to cope with the task of helping
              | Eastern Europe out of planed economy and of bureaucratic dictatorships.
              | Why would path-dependency be important in this phase of transition? Because institutions
              | (such as that of the EEC and EU) have their development constrained by past learning processes
              | and organizational memories rather than by totally new external impetuses.10 In our case, the
              | institutional lasting imprint we will look is that of the cold war vision of Eastern Europe (See
              | Illutration 2 below) that had been totally destroyed by the Soviet domination and which was
              | therefore to be rebuild and reconstruct from scratch.11 The EEC (soon to become EU) which was
              | well active by 1989 as an inter-governmental forum, and which in part had just started working with
              | some Central European countries, was therefore the natural candidate to oversee the re-birth of
              | ‘Europe’, east and west alike, launching a new phase of European integration. This leads us to the
              | third level of questioning, which has to do with the nature of ‘Europe’, as a political project, and the
              | consequences of this dominant position acquired in 1989 by ‘Europe’ which was born out of the
              | western European experience of integration.
              | What has been the impact of a pre-existent integrated political western Europe for eastern
              | Europe? ‘Europe’, as a political project born of the creation of the first communities in the 1950s
              | (European Coal and Steel Community, European Economic Community, EURATOM) was not a
              | ‘neutral’ or ‘technocratic’ project, but was clearly a political project favoured and largely funded by
              | the USA in the immediate post-WW2 period (Aldrich 1997). If one wants therefore to understand
              | what has been the impact of a pre-existent political Europe (EEC) on the post-1989 Europe, one has
              | to understand not only the EEC in the 1980s but also the origins of this political Europe, for it
              | carries in seeds certain traits of the 1950s that might be (or have been) detrimental towards eastern
              | Europe four or five decades later. It is thus important to understand the biases that ‘Europe’ has
              | both for eastern Europe and for Europe as a geographical entity. It is puzzling to note, first of all,
              | how the term “Europe” is now widely referred to as a short cut for a political Europe embodied now
              | by the EU, yet, when one opens a history book on Europe, very little will be said about this political
              | Europe, or that it is not so well ‘integrated’ with the history of European states (just to take two
              | 9 On how the USA’s influence over Europe gradually vanished from the 1980s onwards, see Lundestad (2003).
              | 10 On path-dependency and neo-institutionalism in general, see DiMaggio & Powell (1991: in particular pp. 192ff).
              | 11 One could argue that path-dependency is also important here because the nature of European construction has been to
              | turn its back to a past of national antagonism and enmity (e.g. France vs Germany) and to construct a positive
              | collaborative project instead. The period 1989-1991 is another moment where Europe is reluctant to look at a certain
              | past of rather unorthodox cooperation in the field of military cooperation in the shadow of the NATO and of unpleasant
              | alliances and flirts with extreme right-wing groups in Western Europe. The so-called GLADIO network of stay-behind
              | armies in case of Soviet invasion was behind the strategy of tension by western European governments in the 1960s and
              | 1970s. Ganser (2005) discusses at length these networks. It is interesting to see that these were partly made public
              | around 1990 and 1991, but passed the Fall 1991, all European governments then refused to participate and comment on
              | their existence. Can this be another impact of 1989, namely a sort of Flucht nach vorn to avoid to deal with western
              | European sore experience and concentrate on enlargement instead?

text          | examples, we can quote the work of Tony Judt (2005)12 or Harold James (2003), where the question
              | of European integration occupies only a tiny portion of their influential works on Europe taken as a
              | geographical aggregation of nation-states). So there is a discrepancy between the avowed goal of a
              | political Europe to represent an integrated physical Europe in general and the place granted to this
              | political project in historical works (and probably in the mind of most Europeans). This discrepancy
              | is nonetheless interesting for us because it indicates that the political project of ‘Europe’ has been
              | trying to project the idea of a common European fate as a basis for a full integration.13 It is this
              | project, that one could qualify as hegemonic since it tends to erase other narratives and tends
              | towards its own satisfaction via diverse institutional means. ‘Europe’ disposes of many ways and
              | institutions through which it can diffuse its visions of ‘Europe’. These institutions take various
              | forms, mostly cognitive ones by playing on European symbols, historical memory, etc. although the
              | financial aspect is no less important, with massive projects on European identity, history, funded by
              | the Commission over the last ten or fifteen years. Interestingly, the two declarations by the EEC/EU
              | dealing explicitly with the need to bolster a common European identity were passed by the EEC in
              | 1973 (Copenhagen Declaration) and in 1983 (Stuttgart Declaration), well before the end of the Cold
              | War and in a period where ‘Europe’ meant western Europe.14
              | The surge of such literature on a ‘cultural’ Europe is one manifestation of a rather recent
              | way of conceiving of ‘Europe’ as a place allegedly sharing a same cultural stratum.15 If we take the
              | representation of European construction in a selection of European textbooks, we can see that there
              | is a Europeanisation of the historical representation of ‘Europe’. By Europeanisation, we mean that
              | we are not only witnessing the drafting of a common supra-national curriculum around Europe and
              | the publication of common European textbooks in France and Germany,16 but also that there is a
              | convergence in terms of what ‘Europe’ is about: National different views about European
              | construction gradually vanish and leave place to a common narrative around a cultural Europe
              | (Challand 2009). 1989 is presented as an important unfolding moment for ‘Europe’ since it offered
              | the possibility for eastern Europe to converge and follow the path of western Europe.
              | The following map (Illustration 1) exemplify this occidentalist vision of Eastern Europe
              | whose future depends on the west: once the Soviet block collapsed, Eastern Europe defined as
              | ‘Balkanised’ will gradually transform (‘Occidentalise’ itself) and thus become an extension of
              | western Europe (and here of the broader political environment of the post-9/11 era).

              | 15 I am grateful to Chris Amrbruster for observing that this literature on a cultural Europe is also an effect of 1989 and
              | the ‘return to Europe’. The cultural claim to Europe could be made most easily from CEE on the basis of religion, art,
              | literature and so on because other political and economic claims to Europeanness across the whole continent were
              | perceived as weak. Back to a certain idea of ‘slope’.

              | Such occidentalist representation mirrors what we have called earlier the lasting imprint of
              | cold war visions of Eastern Europe and, which, in a way, pre-announces a hegemonic western
              | European agenda on defining it. Illustration 217 is a political poster of 1952 calling for the creation
              | of the European Defence Community (a plan later voted down
              | by the French Parliament in 1954). One sees that unity is
              | needed to protect against the flood of red blood (a common way
              | to refer to the communist threat), which tries to break into a

              | first member states (the banners listed here is more than those of
              | the Six who joined the ECSC in 1951). While there is prosperity
              | west of this ‘wall’, east of it, there is nothing but a turmoil of
              | destruction and havoc provoked by the red peril. Let us now see

text          | 3. Projecting Europe
              | Projecting the integration of Europe on the basis of a common fate (and we touch here on
              | the theme of the self-reflective dimension of Europe outlined in the introduction) is problematic in
              | three senses.
              | 3.a) Negative Western stereotypes of CEE as a land of emptiness?
              | First, in this vision of an always expanding (western) political Europe, it is as though eastern
              | Europe does not have anything to offer to European integration. In the three questions I have raised
              | above, it is as though eastern Europe was the land of emptiness, with no wealth, knowledge,
              | institutions, or history upon which a post-1989 Europe could draw resources, only the passive
              | receptacles of information, good practices and projects to be funded by Brussels (Illustration 1
              | perfectly matches this distorted reading). But is it the case that eastern Europe was so void of any
              | internal resources for the project of European integration? Surely, the imposition of Sovietization
              | and Stalinism had dire consequences in terms of cult of personality, control of the Communist Party
              | and loss of economic, political or cultural autonomy. Yet, there were diverse attempts within
              | eastern Europe to remodel socialism with a human face or to propose autonomy with different
              | forms (certain writings of Castoriadis (1976) such as the The Hungarian Source are reminders of
              | internal dynamics that have been overlooked and possibly forgotten in contemporary
              | historiography), and Yougoslavia was a living example of what we could call a possibly creative
              | de-alignment throughout the cold war, not to mention Charter 77 and many other non-orthodox
              | communist underground movements in eastern Europe inspired by the Helsinki conference. Yet, by
              | portraying eastern Europe as a single entity, one tends to loose these elements and consider only the
              | common exposure to Soviet totalitarianism, which will not do justice to different national
              | experiences and legacies. Paul Blokker’s latest work (see his paper for this Conference) is precisely
              | about retrieving the positive impact of central and eastern European political thought on political
              | theory in general deserves particular attention against a reducing view on eastern Europe, while
              | Christian Domnitz has presented elsewhere a typology of rich discourses about Europe that
              | emerged in the Ostblock in the period 1970-1990 (Domnitz 2008). This latter work demonstrates
              | how certain themes of a cultural Europe premised on Christianity or other historical traits have also
              | emerged in the shadow of communism and highlight some common ground between East and West
              | of Europe, far from views depicting Eastern Europe as void of possible contribution to Europe at
              | large.
              | 3. b) ‘European’ identity and history
              | The second problem with a certain idea of ‘Europe’ is related to the question of collective
              | identity (and we will touch here on the necessity of auto-institution on the cognitive level
              | introduced in the introduction). As known from social sciences, the question of identity is a very
              | slippery one for it automatically refers to a political project and/or point of view (Wagner 2005).
              | With regard to collective identity18 one should always consider the relation of a polity to its present,
              | future but also to its past. An integrated Europe in the present form is an agglomerate of 27 member
              | states whose future is to aim at integrating into a single market and, possibly, expand to include new
              | member states in the future. Even if the stress is put on the acquis communautaire (expressed
              | generally in legal terms) as a binding common element to the 27 member states, there remains the
              | dividing element of different historical pasts. We could say here that western and eastern Europes
              | (if we take these two realms as cohesive entities for the sake of the intellectual exercise) are in a
              | 18 Another quaestio vexata is the difference between individual and collective identity. On this topic, see Winter &
              | Sivan (1999: Intro), Bottici (2009).

text          | situation of allochronism, in the sense that they are not in the same position and situation with
              | regard to their past and do not have the same critical distance to their own history in order to
              | perform the Vergangenheitsbewältigung that any polity has to perform after traumatic experiences.
              | Judt perfectly demonstrates how the end of WW2, Soviet rule and the liberation from
              | USSR’s yoke have provoked serious distortions of the past and have made of the past ‘another
              | country’ (Judt 2002). Thus, the imposition of a Soviet totalitarian domination and the destruction of
              | eastern European’s public spheres, the remoulding of national pasts according to class struggle
              | lines, the many damnationes memoriae and violent purges imposed during forty years, not to
              | mention the problematic return of newly rediscovered heroes resisting Sovietization in the last 15
              | years (ibid.) and the surge of destructive nationalisms since the fall of the wall are all examples that
              | the past still weigh heavily on eastern European shoulders. Yet, this weigh is difficult to tackle for
              | not enough time has passed since. Western Europe, on the other hand, has had more time to
              | confront its past and reconcile certain divide that traumatic experiences such as WW2 or the
              | political instabilities of the immediate post-war in France, Italy or Germany provoked (yet, this does
              | not mean that the Bewältigung has been perfect neither completed).
              | On the question of collective memory and Vergangenheitsbewältigung, the work of Stefan
              | Troebst (2005. 2006) is most useful for he points to the fragmented themes of memory across
              | Europe. If the Holocaust is a fundamental point for collective western European memory, other
              | themes occupy the fore of collective debates in Central and Eastern European countries, changing
              | from the trauma of foreign occupations and dismemberment by Nazi and then Soviet troops
              | (Poland, Baltic Countries, e.g.), the Gulag experience, or also the terrible recollection of Holodomor
              | (the 1932-33 famine in parts of the Soviet Union which struck large parts of Ukraine). Troebst is
              | correct to state that the 2004 enlargement has revealed the depth of the difference in terms of
              | collective memory between East and West Europe.19
              | Henri Rousso’s article on the dilemma of a European identity (2004) is central for our
              | discussion of heterochrony. Rousso indicates first that there seems to be a pattern in which
              | collective occultation and recollection of historical traumas follow one another (amnesia,
              | anamnesis, etc.). Second, there are also uncompressible times through which historical memory has
              | to go through before any given large social group is able to accept a commonly shared interpretation
              | of the collective past: one cannot expect that a society will deal with its past right after the end of a
              | traumatic experience. Judt’s concluding essay ‘From the House of Dead’ of his Postwar (2005)
              | shows the timing and length of occultation of certain debates. To come back to the theme that
              | ‘Europe’ is in need of a common memory to reinforce its sense of identity, one should note that if
              | ‘Europe’ is about using western European historical experience as a possible foundation for a
              | European identity (as a way to go beyond war between nations, and per antonomase a war between
              | France and Germany), then this historical experience might not be easily accepted by Eastern
              | Europeans for two reasons. First, because not all Eastern Europeans have the same traumatic past to
              | confront (Troebst 2006) and because they are in a different phase of their work on memory
              | (Erinnerungsarbeit) since they have just come out the traumatic Soviet domination for forty years.
              | We are now back to the allochronism question. If one sustains that Eastern Europeans are
              | dragging their feet in acknowledging the centrality of the Holocaust for a common European
              | identity, this is not just putting them in another time (a la Fabian), but it is also forcing onto them a
              | certain theme to confront at the expenses of those considered more urgent by the collective memory
              | 19 „Auch der Holocaust-Holodomor-Gedächtnisgraben ist erst im Zuge der EU-Erweiterung sichtbar geworden. Um
              | Überschwang der Nach-Wende-Zeit waren diese Themen nicht erörtert worden. Die öffentliche Diskussion hat gerade
              | erst begonnen.” (Troebst 2005).

text          | of this region. It is in this condition that an allochronic statement (‘they are dragging their feet..’)
              | becomes an alienating statement leading to a situation of heterochrony, that is a situation of
              | cognitive heteronomy motivated in terms of different time locations.
              | The literature on Central and Eastern Europe and from Eastern European writers abound of
              | the theme of allochronism. The idea of a ‘return’ to Europe implies in an indirect way different time
              | locations and the necessity of ‘touching base’ with the main time of Europe. Some of Czeslaw
              | Milosz’s writings about his experience as a Pole in western Europe is tainted of connotation of
              | backwardness and how this self-perception has affected him and co-nationals.20 Note that
              | allochronism is by no means a feature of western Europeans, but also by eastern Europeans
              | themselves21. Barbra Törnquist-Plewa notes that “Polish ‘Euro-enthusiasts’ who advocate a speedy
              | integration into the EU are deeply critical of Polish society and accuse it of being conservative,
              | limited, fanatically religious, nationalistic, burdened with the heritage of the past and immature.”
              | (Törnquist-Plewa 2002: 237). The fact that allochronic trope can at times become heterochrony is
              | exemplified in the following quote of Janis Peters, Chairman of the Writers’ Union of the Latvian
              | Republic and Latvian writer answering a comment in 1989 about Russians: “The proposition that
              | the Russians are worse off is no consolation for the Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians, or a reason
              | for waiting for a deteriorating situation also in the Baltic area. Why compare us with less developed
              | regions? Compare us instead with Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark” (quoted in Karlsson
              | 2002: 182). Here clearly the writer expresses the view that the Baltic countries resent being ascribed
              | to a backward situation and would prefer to choose to be compared and be part of the more
              | advanced Scandinavian club.
              | Heterochrony is therefore a serious hurdle in the ideational convergence of self-perceptions
              | as ‘Europeans’ by Eastern Europeans. This impression for Central and East Europe that a certain
              | past and certain type of Erinnerungsarbeit that provide significance mostly to western Europeans
              | are leading Eastern Europeans to a certain form of resentment towards ‘Europe’.22 Törnquist-Plewa
              | stresses in the Polish case that “identification with Europe is made difficult by the fact that Poles do
              | not feel accepted by those they want to identify with” (Törnquist-Plewa 2002: 239). This problem
              | can hardly be written off for large parts of Eastern Europe which has suffered from external power
              | (Fremdherrschaft) and it is extremely important to acknowledge this problem. So, while Troebst is
              | right in pointing to a variety of traumas that Europeans have to confront, one should also think of
              | the timing of trauma elaboration and Erinnerungsarbeit. One cannot therefore expect, e.g.,
              | Estonians to recognize the centrality of Holocaust for a European memory, when it is still facing
              | burning questions about the past of Soviet occupation and Russification policies (Kattago 2008a)
              | and has become (again) independent ‘not even’ twenty years ago. Any society should therefore
              | have the right, on a cognitive level, to say: “Holocaust, or Holodomor, is not the central worry for
              | us now” and assert its own priority in terms of collective memory, if such statements are
              | accompanied by a corollary moral obligation to acknowledge the suffering of others. If not, there is
              | an imposition from outside23 of a given memory agenda that prevents full autonomy for that
              | society. As put by the Estonian scholar Siobhan Kattago (2008b), there should be, between eastern
              | and western Europe an ‘agreement to disagree’ on memory and cultural identity.

text          | 3. c) Europe as a western European experience
              | The third and final problem with a certain projection about the integration of Europe on lies
              | in forcing the possibility of a common fate (Schicksalsgemeinschaft) for the whole of Europe. If this
              | is done too rigidly, and by not taking into consideration the fact that by ‘European’ experience we
              | speak in reality of western Europe’s historical experience, then it will be difficult for Eastern
              | Europeans to accept a new imposition of a hegemonic past (Judt 2002). Indeed, there are some
              | biases on the history of European integration that are the result of the context of the nascent Cold
              | War which witnessed the birth of the first European institutions that still loom over certain debates
              | and themes. Looking at the history of European integration through the prism of the Cold War, as
              | done by Messenger (2006) is a good reminder (against the euphoria of federalist historiography24)
              | of the serious security considerations at stake in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the time where the
              | first European communities were founded. What such history does not tell us really is that the
              | context of Cold War served also an ‘imaginary war’, to take the phrase of Kaldor (1990) where the
              | enemy was not so much the external ‘other’ (eastern European communism, or Stalinism as it was
              | frequently described) but the internal ‘other’, namely the opposition of the western European
              | communists in western Europe (or the red threat in the USA of the McCarthy era). The consequence
              | of this was that for a few decades the discourse of the threat of the Soviets and of Stalinism (which
              | was tied to the first years of the European communities) served the purpose of taming part of the
              | political forces in the Europe of the Six (communist parties and trade unions in particular),
              | undermining thus the possibility of representing the construction of a new Europe as a political
              | project of all its citizens, and even in some cases alienating some segments of the population from
              | supporting the European cause.25 So one consequence of the brandishing of external other’s threat
              | for ‘Europe’ with a view on internal affairs was that it turned effectively this external other into a
              | forgotten other of Europe, in the sense that it reinforced the view that Eastern Europe was totally
              | equated with threat and no other potential constitutive elements.
              | In a parallel way, and to come back to current times, one could say that a political Europe
              | ought to be careful when representing itself as a positive project offering equal opportunity for all in
              | its drive to open up new horizons for eastern Europeans and integrate into (western) Europe. After
              | all, there is a sense of a Europe with two speeds, on the one hand, one within the Euro-zone and (at
              | least until to the first days of 2008) with a differentiated access to mobility (with the Schengen area)
              | and a reality of a prosperous western Europe and, on the other hand, still devastated socio-economic
              | landscapes of the former eastern block. The contrast between the ‘old’ and ‘new’ Länder in
              | Germany is a cruel reminder of this two-speed Europe. So to take up again the image of the Cold
              | War, it is one thing to remind us of the historical origins of ‘Europe’, but another are the long-
              | lasting consequences of the Cold War: to a certain degree, European integration of eastern Europe
              | has overlapped with the military expansion of NATO, the history of ‘Europe’ is mostly that of a
              | western Christian (be it Catholic or Protestant) Europe (at the expenses of an Orthodox and also
              | from a Muslim Europe). Current debates about civil society, economic development, or standards of
              | living still echo some of the debates of the 1950s about democracy and development (thinking back
              | on Lipset’s Political Man (1960), or his ‘Requisites to Democracy’ (1959), or Rostow’s Non-
              | communist Manifesto (1960), etc.). The Cold War might be over in facts, but ‘Europe’ might still
              | carry along some of its scoria (Laqueur’s Last days of Europe: Epitaph for an old continent ought
              | to be read critically in this light, I think). It would instead be interesting to explore, in the line of
              | Domnitz (2008), another type of historiography that looks at the point of view of the ‘other’, in this
              | case Eastern European themselves, that considers dissident intra-east European points of view both
              | of the past and current times, or that sheds new lights on the continuing tensions within Eastern
              | 24 See Dinand (2006) and also Kaiser (2006).
              | 25 It is interesting to see how communist parties of western Europe have changed their position on Europe from the
              | 1960s onwards, gradually becoming less anti-Europeanist to declared pro-Europeanists for most of them nowadays.

              | riots in Hungary to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1956 stand off, a proof of a continuing
              | malaise despite a ‘successful’ transition, while the conflict over the Soviet War Memorial in Tallinn
              | illustrates the need for non-hegemonic interpretations of the past in post-national polities (Kattago
              | 2008a).
              | 4. A final word: The Other of Europe and Heterochrony
              | This paper is a call to consider eastern Europe not simply as the void ‘other’ of (western)
              | Europe by 1989 and to a-void western-euro-centrism at large when looking at European integration
              | and 1989. Indeed when the presence of external ‘others’ loom over certain political debates or serve
              | as a marker of differentiation between large social groups, this is often done at the expenses of a
              | sound discussion of each other’s points of view and all too often serve only emotional purposes
              | (one of which can be a repli identitaire fed by collective resentment) and lead to essentalisations
              | both of the internal content of what ‘Europe’ is about (in terms of borders, culture, identity, or
              | memory), and about its ‘others’—past and present ones.26
              | Since Eastern Europe is the geographical space from which the ‘other’ of Stalinism and
              | communism threatened the Europe of the Six in the 1950s, one should examine the relations
              | between a political Europe and Eastern Europe also in this light and with great attention. Surely
              | Eastern Europe no longer represents such an ‘other’ for a political Europe, but lasting imprints of
              | the cold war period and mental maps (as shown in Ill. 2 and its contemporary version in Ill. 1)
              | might render this work difficult. Now that ‘Europe’ is made of 27 member states, surely the centre
              | of gravity of a common political Europe has moved eastwards, a fact that one could clearly perceive
              | in the latest round of harsh negotiations (especially from Poland who tries to maximize its full
              | membership into the EU and does not hesitate to behave, at times, in an arrogant manner since it is
              | now part of the club) around the Treaty of Lisbon signed in December 2007. Yet, when it comes to
              | writing the history of Europe or the description of ‘Europe’ as a cultural entity, the centre of gravity
              | probably still has to be re-adjusted accordingly, giving more voice and space to eastern European
              | experiences and projects. If not, one risks creating artificial binaries rendering ideational
              | convergence around the EU impossible.
              | Such binary divides can also be found in the self-reflective dimensions of Europe when a
              | certain type of occidentalist literature contributes to otherize through a variety of means and tropes
              | about Central and Eastern European societies. One dimension of this contemporary ‘otherization’
              | process that we have discussed in this paper and which is, in our view, understudied, is the question
              | of allochronism and this tendency to ascribe groups to different time locations. We have argued that
              | the capacity of auto-institution on the cognitive level is as important for the viability of the
              | European project as structural convergence around the EU has been and is for the 12 new member
              | states. This capacity of auto-institution for Eastern European societies is currently most vividly
              | necessary on the field of Erinnerungsarbeit, Vergangenheitsbewältigung and collective memory
              | around the question of a ‘cultural Europe’. If not Eastern European societies feel that they are
              | 26 For some preliminary conclusion on the study of Islam and Turkey as the ‘other’ of Europe, see Challand (2008). For
              | a plea to be more inclusive about the nature and content of ‘Europe’ see Shore ( 2000: 63):
              | “[…] Creating the ‘European identity’, as depicted in EU discourse, entails a degree of exclusion of the Other. […]
              | ‘European identity tends to become meaningful only when contrasted to that which is not Europe. As Europe
              | consolidates and converges, and as the barriers between European nation-states are eliminated, so the boundaries
              | separating Europe from its Third World ‘Others’ have intensified. […] The problem with this approach to identity is its
              | absolutism: its failure to recognise cultures as composite and hybrid entities.”
