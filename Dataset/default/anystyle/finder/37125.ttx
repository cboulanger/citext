              | This volume presents several authors who are developing research projects in various European
              | universities and research institutions. In spite of the independent character of the analyses and of the most
              | of the empirical observations and results reported here, there is something which unites them all, namely a
              | certain similarity in looking at things from a political culture perspective. Moreover, there is something else
              | which unites their perspectives over the Eastern European political cultures: a certain look from inside. The
              | true motivation for what joins them all in this volume could be described as a need for explanation, no
              | matter the different political and culture heritages of the countries, regimes, institutions and people targeted
              | by the researches reported in this volume.
              | It is this need for explanation which makes the true binding – either implicit or explicit – of this
              | volume. What makes these few Eastern European political culture researches reported here prove the
              | same need for explanation is the way they share the perception of the post-1989 Eastern European
              | democracy experience, and certain stereotypes in relating variate political phenomenology to political
              | culture.

              | The need for explanation should not surprise anybody, especially if we are to study the Eastern
              | European politics. Nevertheless, it is more than just the necessity to explain (what?) and how? is going on
              | in politics. It is also the need to understand why?, when?, or what for? The long transition processes from
              | the communist to democratic regimes made almost all Eastern European people and their countries
              | experience during the past two decades the need to explain their choices, values, beliefs, norms, attitudes,
              | and symbols. Their grievances or prejudices. Their institutions, regimes, and discourses. All these entail a
              | deep understanding of both remote cultural roots and current political perceptions, steadiness and
              | variability, contingency and necessity, change and resistance to change. They require not only to explain
              | things. First and foremost, they require a concept, a paradigm, and a method. It often requires a model.
              | The modeling idea is as old as our philosophical thinking. It reminds us of Plato and makes us think
              | about the city, world, society and politics as of imperfect shadows of one perfect idea. To understand them,
              | we need first of all to overlap the “real” and the “ideal”, the “shadows” and the “model”. It is this overlapping
              | which explains what the real construct – be it society or polity, tradition or institution, individual action or
              | policy – actually needs in order to identify itself with the ideal construct.
              | Modeling is, as a matter of fact, a relevant component of Political Science: ideology, political
              | regime, state, governance or voting – all of them have been modeled and analyzed by means of models.
              | Before anything else, a model “explains” the real world by capturing few but universal laws,
              | principles. It thus makes both modeler and user develop expectations with respect to its explanative power.
              | Whether these are finally fulfilled or not, this depends on the model. In the classical approach, models as
              | explanative tools involve covering laws. For example, economic laws and ideas do explain the
              | transformation processes in the Eastern European newly appeared democracies, but they cannot fully
              | explain them, and obviously not them all.
              | After the first decade following the 1989- Eastern European political phenomena, students of
              | democracy identified the main characteristics of the Eastern European transition to democratic regime
              | processes and tried to explain their unfolding. It was probably the first time when many agreed that, beyond
              | economical difficulties, there were some others which did not fit this model and resisted explanations based
              | on covering economical laws. Explaining politics requires more than social, economical and financial
              | methodologies altogether: it requires political methodology. Moreover, it requires a political methodology
              | able to reconsider such issues like variability, context-, path- and initial conditions dependence in order to
              | explain one of the fundamental questions in the post-1989 political analysis and methodology (Tilly, 1995):
              | how should we study the political change? – Long after the 1989 Eastern European political phenomena,
              | people still argued on the nature of political change, on its real target and on its real means and ends.
              | Invariable models of political change could not tackle anymore the complexity of the political history and
              | failed to fulfill the need for explanation of both scholars, either old or young, and of the people, either
              | ordinary people or elites.
              | Unavoidably, political culture came to the front. In spite of the hard critics and apparently never
              | ending disputes, political culture theories have suceeded to find room for “impressive” coming-backs
              | (Mishler and Pollack, 2003) and for managing ambiguity in definitions and terminology. It is not the first time
              | when they do come back and, most probably, not the last. However, this time there is something missing in
              | the room: explanative power requires explanative methodology. And a good explanation methodology
              | cannot ignore or avoid modeling. Nevertheless, it is modeling which is actually missing in this room.
              | The past two decades have been known as a time of intensive theoretical and empirical research
              | in Eastern European political cultures. Remarcable works have been published by now famous authors:
              | “The Power of Symbols against the Symbols of Power. The Rise of Solidarity and the Fall of State
              | Socialism in Poland” (Jan Kubik, 1994), “Modernization and Postmodernization: Cultural, Economic and

              | (Hans-Dieter Klingeman, Dieter Fuchs and Jan Zielonga (Eds.), 2006), to name but few of the most
              | relevant ones. Many books and articles of these and other authors represent now the foundation of a
              | difficult work of disentangling the complicated historical and political heritages of the Eastern European
              | political cultures, aimed at understanding how people, cultures and polities endured altogether the hard
              | experiences of the communist regimes. All these major theoretical works have been published soon after
              | 1989, when the Eastern Europeans were struggling and striving in the sophisticated transition processes
              | toward democratization and economic stability. It was a time of high political contend. However, more than
              | two decades have passed and, notwithstanding its weakness and scarcity, the democratic construction
              | has provided a chance for reflection. As the time passed, the Eastern Europeans – citizens as well as
              | elites – got enough distance from their personal experiences, sentiments and passions so as to be able to
              | finally reflect as objectively as possible with respect to their communism and post-communism experiences.
              | While much of the research works mentioned earlier were fundamentally about a look from outside, finally,
              | a look from inside is now possible. How valuable it is right now or could be when compared with the above-
              | mentioned high-level expertise works, depends on how much it suceeds to uncover its thick political culture
              | roots. This volume is about this look from inside.
              | The volume is divided in four sections, ballancing the interest for theoretical modeling with that for
              | computational modeling and simulation of political phenomena.
              | The 1st Section, “Theoretical Models”, concern theoretical modeling and introduces one research
              | work which reviews major researches in the area of structure of political attitudes (structure of ideology)
              | during the past 80 years in Europe. The author, Bojan Todosijević, explains how political attitude and
              | structure of ideology studies would impact the modeling of political action, especially in the Eastern
              | European new democracies.
              | The 2nd Section, “Political Culture Computational and Simulation Modeling Studies”, concern
              | computational modeling and simulation of political action, policy, and polity. The three research works
              | included here address the political action modeling (Bruce Edmonds), the polity simulation modeling
              | (Camelia Florela Voinea), and the modeling of corruption, extortion and fiscal evasion phenomena (Martin
              | Neumann).
              | The 3rd Section, “Political Culture Analysis”, provides empirical comparative results on political
              | culture vs. rational choice models, and proves their implications on the mass support for democracy in the
              | Eastern European post-communist countries (Zoran Pavlovic).
              | The 4th Section, “EU Non-State Partnership Modeling”, includes one research work on the political
              | culture of EU partnership in the non-member states: the European Neighborhood Policy as a political
              | culture model of partnership in the European politics (Sima Rakutiene).
              | The 5th Section, “Welfare Culture Studies”, presents one modeling approach on welfare culture in
              | Greece, combining governance, welfare economics and social assitance studies with public policy
              | modeling (Dimitrios Kotroyannos, Stylianos Tzagkarakis, Apostolos Kamekis and Marinos Chourdakis).
              | The Conclusions (Camelia Florela Voinea) presents a general Eastern European picture of political
              | culture studies, including several other authors and research works besides those contributing to the

              | ISSN-L 2285 - 4916
              | present volume. The Conclusions show that the Eastern European political culture research exhibits
              | preferences for a particular relationship between (i) the political values, identity, behaviors and attitudes
              | modeling, on the one hand, and for (ii) the generative simulation modeling of political phenomena, on the
              | other hand. This relationship is described as a political methodological relationship between political
              | mechanisms and political cultures.
              | Getting back to the rationale of this volume, we should emphasize again the independent character
              | of the researches presented in this volume. It is important to do this for three reasons. One relates their
              | independent character to the reality that Eastern European political science research is guided from within
              | the society, and this proves both the awareness of researchers and the social utility of their approaches.
              | Another one relates the scarce appearances of political culture modeling research in Eastern Europe to the
              | scarcity of its research funding, which seriously limits its development, but nevertheless cannot stop it. And
              | finally, a third reason concerns the extension of political culture theories so as to include new elements
              | provided by the interdisciplinary research in areas like European welfare culture or neighborhood culture,
              | which emerged from latest political unfoldings in Eastern and Southern Europe following either 2008
              | economical crisis or EU partnership policies.
              | First, although independently developed, some of the Eastern European political analysis
              | researches included in the volume share a major theoretical tendency towards modeling approaches of
              | political issues, including political action and political attitude, voting behavior and electoral campaigns,
              | political messages and political images on the Eastern European electoral market, post-communist
              | institutional authority and legitimacy, ethnicity and nationalism, constitutionalism and autoritarianism,
              | corruption and extortion, and many others. As political methodology, Eastern European political
              | phenomena modeling research reported in this volume addresses fundamental issues concerning (1) the
              | type of democracy constructs elaborated by the Eastern European countries, and (2) political identity,
              | sovereignity and political action of the new Eastern European democracies inside EU or outside EU, but
              | expecting for the EU intergration. As concerning the type of democratic construct and democracy
              | perception in each Eastern European country, these researches share the idea of political cultures as
              | influence factors in the political change modeling.
              | From this perspective, two authors succeed to bring to the front old political culture research issues
              | and to provide fresh answers.
              | Bojan Todosijević’s research on the structure of political attitudes reports fundamental
              | approaches during the past almost hundred years in the area of structure of ideology. Political attitudes
              | made the subject of political analysis and political methodology from the beginning of the 20th century.
              | Todosijević systematically reports research on attitudes in Social Psychology emphasizing the difference
              | between the long tradition and huge number of theoretical and analytical works, on the one hand, and their
              | low level of impact on the attitude methodological research and development, on the other hand. He is a
              | promoter of the idea that ideological dimensions have a relevant impact on the political behavior. Such
              | orientation of research would not only help understanding political action, but has a special relevance in the
              | Eastern European political space, where the communist ideology’s late impact has shaped “atypical
              | ideological configurations” (p. 35 in this volume). This idea points to the particular ways in which citizens in
              | the Eastern European post-communist regimes “organize and express their basic political views” (ibid.).
              | The study of political attitudes (formation, stability, structure, expression) in Eastern Europe would thus help
              | in modeling the type of Eastern European democratic construct and explaining the atypical political
              | behavior – a major concern in the EU structures, where the Eastern European democratic consolidation
              | processes raise difficult problems, even long after the political integration of the new Eastern European
              | democracies.

              | Though from a slightly different perspective, but still in the same area of political attitude research
              | like Bojan Todosijević’, Zoran Pavlovic addresses the issue of mass democratic expression and support
              | for democracy in the Eastern European ex-communist regimes by introducing a comparative analysis
              | between two competing explanative models of political behavior: political culture vs. rational choice. His
              | post-elections survey research allows for the definition, empirical observation and analysis of socio-
              | demographic, institutional and cultural predictors of the mass support for democracy. His variance modeling
              | approach re-iterates the disputes concerning the explanative power of the defined survey variables. His
              | approach tries to show the role the political values play in the development of a democratic political culture
              | in a transitional society by influencing the consolidation of the democratic institutions. Pavlovic’s approach
              | gives support to the theories relating political values and institutions by arguing in favor of combining effects
              | of cultural and institutional variables. His preference assumes actually an Eastern European stereotype
              | model of “creating the democratic political culture” by “creating ‘democrats’ as well as creating democracy”
              | (p. 136 in this volume). This position if often encountered in the current Eastern European literature on
              | attitude, behavior and mentality in transition to democracy and consolidation of democratic institutions and
              | proves once more the similarity in the preferences, understandings and expectation analysis of many
              | Eastern European authors (Srbljinovic, 2012; Atanasov and Cvetanova, 2012; Petričušić, 2013; Ferić and
              | Lamza-Posavec, 2013) .
              | Second, although quite few and disparate, the researches included in this volume prove a high
              | interest and a considerable potential for research development in the area of political culture-based
              | computational modeling and simulation of political phenomena. The issue seems rather strange for many of
              | the works on political methodology published lately in Eastern Europe. For many reasons, computational
              | modeling and simulations appears to Eastern European Political Science researchers as a remote area of
              | research and development. Without being some particular weakness of the Eastern European research
              | only, computational and simulation modeling has puzzled political methodology experts from allover the
              | world by introducing a different concept on how we should describe and explain political phenomena.
              | Following the example of Social Simulation, computational modeling and simulation has been accepted in
              | Political Science as well. This volume succeeds to aggregate some disparate approaches on this modeling
              | area and issues. The three research works presented in the 2nd Section of the volume address both the
              | ontology and epistemology of political culture modeling, with a special focus on political methodology.
              | In his chapter on cognitive modeling of political action, Bruce Edmonds introduces the problem of
              | relating modeling methodology with political phenomenology. He highlights the issues of abstracting the
              | types, levels and granularity of social and political phenomenology by means of computational cognitive
              | modeling descriptions of social actions, norms, interactions and goal-driven behaviors. As one of the
              | leading experts in both social complexity modeling and agent-based social simulation, Edmonds challenges
              | the standard artificial society model by introducing elements of cognitive complexity in the individual agent
              | descriptions. As a computational and simulation modeling approach, this endeavour brings to the front the
              | now classical debate on the individual agency and the relationship between cognitive, social and political
              | phenomena which might get computational and simulation expression in an artificial society model. The
              | model he proposes actually challenges the classical KISS style (Axelrode, 1995), and extends the
              | representation issue to a methodological issue in political action modeling.
              | Camelia Florela Voinea challenges both political methodology and simulation modeling of political
              | phenomena. In her chapter, she addresses several issues in political phenomena modeling, like political
              | mechanisms, processes and pathways, reviewing and revisiting some of their definitions and terminology.
              | In addressing the political mechanism issue, Voinea answers the Tilly’s well-known claim (1995) for a
              | change in political phenomena modeling methodology by introducing both emergence and downward

              | causation modeling in the generative simulation architectures. Inspired by the artificial society models, she
              | introduces an operational concept of the generative simulation architecture in the artificial polity model. Her
              | research aims at advancing the political phenomena modeling theory by including cross-recurrence and
              | cross-recursivity in generative process descriptions. Voinea’s approach addresses the need for a
              | methodological shift towards complexity-based models in political phenomena modeling. In a much similar
              | way to Edmonds’ approach, her work combines both philospohy of science and virtual experiments of
              | simulation modeling.
              | Martin Neumann focuses more on computational modeling by generalizing ontologies of Mafia-
              | type systems to an artificial society model able to simulate the emergence and growth of extortion systems.
              | Neumann uses his previous social simulation experience to develop computational models of social and
              | political corruption which could allow for public policy modeling aimed at controlling the phenomenology of
              | political and bureaucratic corruption. What makes his approach interesting for the theme of this volume is
              | the use of agent-based system simulation in the development of a political culture model of a mafia-type
              | social configuration inside an artificial society. His ontology identifies elements of political culture which
              | exist and could generate deviant behavior in any kind of society, especially in the weak new democracies
              | situated at the margins of the Eastern Europe. Extortion ontologies is but one example of how can they be
              | used to develop models of culture and explain the generation of subcultures.
              | Third, the researches on European political culture prove a tendency to extend their area by
              | including new issues which emerged from the latest political developments in Eastern and Southern
              | Europe. This explains the presence in this volume of two approaches on European welfare culture and EU
              | non-state partnership culture.
              | Sima Rakutiene introduces a model of EU neighborhood culture which captures the non-state
              | partnership experiences associated lately to the EU accession and integration pending processes in non-
              | member countries, like Lithuania, the Baltic states as well as some of the South-Eastern states.
              | Rakutiene’s model description might suggests that computational and simulation modeling of such political
              | phenomena should take into consideration revisiting the agent definition in agent-based systems, in which
              | agents are usually described as either individuals, organizations or (nation)-states. Non-state actors might
              | involve a complexity approach to agent definition and agency concept in artificial society and polity models.
              | Dimitrios Kotroyannos and his doctoral students, Stylianos Tzagkarakis, Apostolos Kamekis
              | and Marinos Chourdakis introduce a model of welfare culture which is being developed in a Greek
              | national education and social assistance research project. The welfare concept is usually related to the
              | economic welfare theories. This approach suggests the extension of political culture area so as to include
              | welfare issues. Welfare culture modeling points to the subculture emergence in societies under economical
              | and political stress – an issue which has not been approached so far in the literature on social modeling.
              | As it is, this volume highlights the Eastern European political culture modeling research resources,
              | tendencies and methodological contributions. It aims at introducing young Eastern European authors and
              | their researches and provides a signal that political methodology research needs further consideration,
              | funding and networking in Eastern Europe and not only.
