              | Abstract: Over the last two decades, the Mbororo – a “marginal” ethnic
              | group – have experienced some unexpected rewards due to a new policy in
              | Cameroon’s West Region. Among the changes that affected the Mbororo
              | were the following: a new legal-institutional framework (the 1996 Constitu-
              | tion), the consequences of the multi-party competition since 1990, and the
              | mobilisation outside of political parties in the framework of an association
              | for the promotion of ethnic interests (the MBOSCUDA, founded 1992).
              | The combination of these factors has led to a Mbororo political awakening.
              | This contribution aims to better understand the determinants and key play-
              | ers in this development.

              | Over the past two decades, the Mbororo, a “marginal” ethnic group, ac-
              | cording to the official terminology,1 experienced unexpected recognition
              | due to political factors in the West Region of Cameroon. The causes and
              | consequences of this profound change are largely unknown. The on-going
              | debate (sometimes accompanied by violence) on the link between citizen-
              | ship and autochthony first appears rather disadvantageous for a group as
              | unstable as the Mbororo. But the state-sponsored policy of settlement, ini-
              | tially viewed with suspicion, has affected the Mbororo favourably, especially
              | since it was associated with better schooling, producing a critical mass of
              | “elites”. There was a Mbororo “political awakening” in the context of
              | changes in areas including but not limited to the following: the effects of a
              | new legal-institutional framework (the 1996 Constitution), the consequences
              | of competition between political parties since 1990 (even in a system that is
              | far from being a democracy), and mobilisation outside of political parties by
              | the Mbororo Social and Cultural Development Association of Cameroon
              | (MBOSCUDA), since 1992.
              | This matter merits reflection when one considers that under the single-
              | party system (1966–1990/91), the Mbororo, semi-settled Fulani herdsmen,
              | had always maintained a distance vis-à-vis the Cameroonian state: Their
              | contact with the administration was for a long time limited to simply paying
              | tax on livestock. Apart from this, the Cameroonian government did not
              | need the Mbororo. In turn, the Mbororo did not need the state (Davis 1995:

text          | The term “marginal” refers to the people who are distinguished by their way of life,
              | characterised mainly by the physical instability (nomadic, semi-nomadism or trans-
              | humance) and the extreme precariousness of their material condition, which re-
              | duces them to a situation of extreme dependence on their natural environment
              | (forests, pastures, etc.). They generally live by hunting, fishing, gathering, or barter,
              | and sometimes engage in subsistence farming using the most rudimentary tech-
              | niques (Donfack Sokeng 2001: 113, see Barbier 1981: 239-260). The Mbororo and
              | the Pygmies have been identified by the United Nations and by themselves as “in-
              | digenous peoples”, i.e., communities who have in common, in principle, historical
              | continuity with a specific region before colonisation and a close relationship with
              | their land; they maintain at least in part, separate social, economic and political sys-
              | tems. They have different languages, cultures, beliefs and knowledge systems and
              | are determined to preserve and develop their identity and separate institutions.
              | They also form a non-dominant, marginalised and discriminated sector within soci-
              | ety (Shulte-Tenckhof 1997). But in Cameroon, as elsewhere in Africa, the situation
              | is complicated by the fact that the United Nations and its Working Group on In-
              | digenous Peoples adopted the concept of “autochtone” as the official translation of
              | “indigenous” (indigène). However, it has a very different meaning than the word
              | “autochtone” has in Francophone countries, where autochthones are rarely mar-
              | ginal groups but rather dominant groups that control the state (see Geschiere
              | 2009).
              | Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo
meta          | 73
text          | 220). But since the return to multi-party politics in 1990, the masquerade of
              | electoral competition and the pursuit of electoral votes made the Mbororo
              | attractive to candidates, in contrast to the situation during to the single-party
              | period, when the Mbororo hardly ever voted.
              | How deep does this political participation run? What are the key criteria
              | for success? These are the main framing questions of this analysis, which
              | originated from the work I have been carrying out for quite some time in
              | the West Region on the dominant groups, the Bamun and Bamileke. I real-
              | ised recently that research on dominant groups is incomplete without look-
              | ing at the dominated groups, the ethnic minorities, on a sub-national level.
              | This shift of attention has required a degree of openness regarding the inter-
              | action between Mbororo and “native” farmers, be they dominant or in a
              | minority position. In this way, my approach was exploratory. To achieve
              | these goals, I used three research techniques: I examined written sources and
              | conducted both interviews and focus group discussions.
              | First, I consulted written sources, which consisted of literature (books,
              | newspapers, magazine articles, Internet sources, etc.) on the Mbororo and
              | the surrounding farming groups: the Bamun, the Bamileke, the Tikar, and
              | others. While consulting Internet sources, I found that the assumed margin-
              | ality of the Mbororo clashed with the high public exposure of their prob-
              | lems in these various media. Primary sources consisted of papers issued by
              | the Mbororo themselves, essentially MBOSCUDA documents, which I
              | accessed through administrative and municipal archives. The research, car-
              | ried out by way of semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions,
              | led me to several other localities in the West, and more broadly in Noun
              | Division, where the concentration of Mbororo is highest. I also conducted
              | interviews with Mbororo residents and many elites in Yaoundé, the capital
              | of Cameroon, and in the city of Jakiri in the Northwest Region, with the aim
              | of obtaining data for comparison. The focus group discussions were con-
              | ducted with Mbororo “elites” (administrative, political and traditional) and
              | many ordinary citizens among the farmer groups.
              | In the following, I will first describe the socio-political context, then
              | successively analyse the degree of political participation of the Mbororo in
              | the West Region, the determinants of participation and, finally, their political
              | awakening, from a comparative perspective.2

              | A Favourable Pastoral Environment,
              | a “Marginal” People
              | Western Cameroon is an area dominated by two ethnic groups: the Bamileke
              | and Bamun. The Bamileke are grouped into seven divisions (Bamboutos,
              | Upper Nkam, the Upper Plateau, Kung-Khi, Menoua, Mifi, and Nde) and
              | one hundred chiefdoms. In those divisions, the density reaches more than
              | 200 inhabitants per square kilometre. The Bamun kingdom itself keeps the
              | same boundaries as Noun Division, covering an area of 7,687 square kilo-
              | metres, or 55.35 per cent of the West Region (see Mouiche 2005: chap. 2).
              | Apart from these two dominant groups, the region’s population is made up
              | of eight sizeable ethnic minorities that can be grouped into two categories:
              | The first is made up of ethnic groups previously established and residing in
              | the Bamileke-dominated area: the Mbo, the Banen, the Bakua, the Dibum
              | (or Yabassi); in the Bamun land we find the Tikar. The second group is
              | formed out of “late-comers”, groups that arrived even after the Europeans:
              | the Poakam in the Bamun land,3 and the Mbororo, found in both the
              | Bamun and Bamileke highlands.
              | The Hegemony of the “Native Farmers”
              | In Cameroon, the relationship between the government and pastoralists is
              | almost always characterised by – mostly failing – settlement policies. Among
              | the exceptions is the case of the Mbororo who inhabit the West Region. The
              | high plateaus and wet vegetation dominated by grasslands are quite suitable
              | for pastoral activities. Nomadism was abandoned when the population an-
              | chored itself at its wintering site and adopted a transhumance practice, the
              | cattle breeders delegating more and more of their flocks to third parties.
              | How did the Mbororo become sedentary? Among the geographical features
              | that made the lifestyle transition at all possible, the altitude seems to play the
              | most important role: The wintering sites are frequently above 1,500 meters,
              | an altitudinal threshold that changes the cultural conditions. The settlement
              | was also the result of an authoritative policy of the administration associated
              | with improved pastures.4

              | The Pouakam arrived in the late 1960s in the Bamun kingdom, well after the
              | Mbororo (and post-colonially), but they have acquired the status of native.

text          | Though the natural features of the West Region are very suitable for
              | cattle breeding, the socio-political context is disadvantageous for the
              | Mbororo. Indeed, farmers exert an unchallenged supremacy over breeders.
              | This is first of all due to a numerical supremacy but also a political suprem-
              | acy in the broadest sense. Most of the West, particularly the Bamileke Plat-
              | eau, is more or less reserved for farmers whose settlements have population
              | densities of 200 to 300 inhabitants (or more) per square kilometre. The
              | result is that land for cattle grazing comprises less than 10 per cent of the
              | area of the country. Land saturation and the increase of cultivated areas have
              | prevented the expansion of livestock. There are few areas left for breeding
              | in Bana, the Bamboutos Mountains and the Galim area. Pastures in the
              | Bamboutos Mountains are considered the largest and richest in Bamileke
              | country, one reason the colonial authorities reserved their exclusive use for
              | European cattle breeders (see Champaud 1983: 321; Fark-Grüninger 1995:
              | 111). The population density in rural Bamun is much lower, ranging be-
              | tween 20 to 40 people per square kilometre. However, this occupancy rate is
              | hardly suitable for extensive livestock farming. But as the cultivation areas
              | are not equally distributed, some open lands remain available to pastoralists.
              | It is due to the advantages of this region of Bamun that the Mbororo have
              | established many colonies there.
              | The difficulties of the Mbororo are related not only to their minority
              | status but also to the recentness of their settling, to which the “native”
              | farmers have reacted negatively. Here it may be useful to pose a few simple
              | questions: Are the Mbororo regarded in the West (by the Bamileke, Bamun,
              | Mbo, Tikar, farmers, etc.) as autochthons? Do they enjoy full citizenship
              | rights? What about their official recognition as “indigenous people” in Cam-
              | eroon? Let us start with a related reflection: The situation in the West Re-
              | gion is broadly comparable to that of the neighbouring English-speaking
              | Northwest Region, which is better studied (see Duni et al. 2009; Pelican
              | 2008: 540-560; Boutrais 1984: 225-256). Indeed, there is no documented,
              | historical, pre-colonial continuity of the Mbororo in any part of today’s
              | West and Northwest Regions of Cameroon. As pastoralists, they have never
              | considered buying and thus owning their grazing lands, so in the absence of
              | territoriality they are considered “migrants” – and in a more negative sense
              | they are considered “strangers” by neighbouring farmers, who see them-
              | selves as “landowners” and the Mbororo as their “guests” (see Pelican 2008:
              | 540-560). To put it simply, the contrasts between the two groups are strong:
              | The farmers are subsumed under the broader Bantu culture, while the
              | Mbororo relate to the Fulani cultures that are scattered across the Sahel
              | lands of West Africa. The divergence of economic interests between the two
              | populations always manifests itself in a latent (though at times open) con-

              | flict. The most common causes of confrontations are the extension of set-
              | tlements at the expense of pastureland, and the damage caused to land and
              | property by herds.
              | The Mbororo: A People on the Margins of
              | Socio-political Development
              | By observing the extent of the Mbororo ethno-cultural area, one quickly
              | detects a lack of social infrastructure, especially in health and education (see
              | Salé 1991; Burnham 1996; Duni et al. 2009). All children (girls and boys)
              | have a Quranic education, and almost all acquire a good command of the
              | Quran before the age of fourteen, a feat that is due to the inexpensive na-
              | ture of this education and how well suited it is to the kind of life the
              | Mbororo lead. However, there is a problem in terms of “modern” basic
              | education: According to a study conducted by Abouamé Salé on the
              | Mbororo in Noun Division, only 2 out of 100 Mbororo children attend
              | school today. Only 3 of every 1,000 students in the Noun are Mbororo, and
              | girls make up a mere 16 per cent of registered Mbororo schoolchildren; by
              | high school, this percentage drops to just 12 (Salé 1991: 40). The Mbororo
              | generally have very little access to higher education, with few going beyond
              | Form 4. Pastoralism requires a lot of constant work by a large number of
              | people; even school-age children are often needed.
              | Administratively, the relations between the Mbororo and the Came-
              | roonian state remain remote. This verbal attack made by the senior divi-
              | sional officer of Bui, Northwest Region, in a meeting with the Mbororo
              | sums up their complex and ambiguous relationship:
              | You Mbororo people are tearing yourselves apart instead of coming
              | together like the rest of Cameroon. You call yourselves an abandoned
              | people? Who abandoned you? You abandoned yourselves! Keeping
              | away from others, keeping away from me! How do you expect me to
              | understand you when you keep away from me, keep away from others
              | when we are all here in the towns and you remain away from us, away
              | from everything, away from me – up in the hills out there in the
              | Bush!5
              | Moreover, taking advantage of the low level of education of many Mbororo,
              | some officials are harming Mbororo interests. In the interviews, the
              | Mbororo voiced a whole string of complaints against the administration. A
              | female Mbororo informant enumerated some of the most frequently occur-
              | ring issues they have to deal with: intimidation; harassment; extortion of

              | agro-pastoral conflicts (the farmer systematically winning against the dis-
              | armed and helpless Mbororo), etc. “These greedy and heartless people con-
              | sider the Mbororo their breastfeeders, or merely plantations from which
              | they can draw their pensions!” said our female informant. “To satisfy their
              | predatory instinct, they sometimes do not hesitate to ask for non-existing
              | official documents, or to invoke unknown provisions in Cameroonian law.”6
              | Politically, the Mbororo are generally characterised by their apathy,
              | acknowledged as much within the communities as outside of them. As one
              | Mbororo informant said, “It is not fair to say that a man from the Mbororo
              | is addicted to fighting [political rivals]. He talks about ‘plotique’ to mean brib-
              | ery, lying, plots and so on.” This complements the view held by the non-
              | Mbororo. A Mbo informant of Santchou describes the Mbororo stereo-
              | types: “They are more interested in trade. [...] They do not take part in
              | meetings and do not complain. They are not ambitious because of their lack
              | of education.” And finally, this Tikar of Magba said: “No Mbororo is in-
              | cluded on our list [Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (RDPC)
              | Magba].7 They have little interest in politics but vote RDPC. [...] When put-
              | ting together our lists of candidates, those who demand to be taken into
              | account are the Yamba, Musgum, Arabs and Kotoko.”8 In addition,
              | Mbororo society is not centralised but rather built on the basis of small clan
              | units led by ardos (heads). These ardos appear nowhere in the organisational
              | charts of the administration (which do, however, include other traditional
              | authorities). In other words, they are not notable among the local chiefs, let

              | not forget the not-too-distant past, when the construction of family housing
              | was done exclusively by women while the men went about their pastoral
              | occupations. In more concrete terms, one finds in today’s Didango, the
              | “capital of the Mbororo in Noun Division” and the only settlement where
              | the Mbororo have left the bush to settle completely, the existence of
              | “mixed” marriages between the Mbororo and the Bamun. Here, Mbororo
              | are landowners, and this is recognised by their neighbours (the Bamun). In
              | Didango, the Mbororo engage in agriculture alongside their pastoral activi-
              | ties. Furthermore, along with the presence of Mbororo intellectual elites,
              | one also notes the emergence of a bourgeois capitalist elite that stands out
              | from the group through its participation in the modern sectors of the econ-
              | omy (hardware, food, transportation) in nearby city centres such as Kou-
              | taba, Foumbot, Foumban and Bafoussam.
              | What is striking about these social dynamics is the emergence and the
              | gradual establishment of private property. The nouveau riche gradually inte-
              | grate themselves into the field of the modern capitalist economy and are
              | vectors of change in their community, a fact observable in the possession of
              | real assets and access to food, water and electricity. The nouveau riche are
              | also factors of “social reproduction”, as they initiate their children into this
              | area and send them to schools and specialised training centres; under this
              | lies a sense of class consciousness, a logic of conservation, capable of sus-
              | taining social relationships based on a vision of their integration into the
              | capitalist market society. Citizens with low or precarious social and eco-
              | nomic positions have a relatively low propensity to participate (Mayer and
              | Perrineau 1992: 23, 29). Following the progressive effects of schooling,
              | members of the Mbororo community have increasingly acquired positions in
              | the administration of Cameroon (see Table 1). And in the context of the
              | neopatrimonial Cameroon of today, to be a member of the administration is
              | a good starting point for any strategy to occupy political space.

              | Criteria for and Depth of Mbororo Political
              | Participation
              | We have explored the Western Mbororo’s ethnographic and socio-political
              | environment; we will now discuss their political participation in this new
              | context of political liberalisation. We noted above how difficult it was for
              | them to vote under the one-party system; however, we must not forget that
              | despite their political apathy in the implementation of the government’s
              | policy of national integration, the Mbororo had for a long time been associ-
              | ated with the structures of the single party. This explains why, before 1990,
              | two of their localities (Yolo and Didango) were provided with a local com-
              | mittee of the UNC,9 then the RDPC, in the Bamun kingdom.10 However,
              | there was no Mbororo representation at the upper level (sub-section and
              | section) despite the unsuccessful attempts, the first of their kind, of Yerima
              | Dairou and Lerah Amadou of Didango, to win the respective sub-section
              | presidencies of the RDPC (adult branch of the party) and the OJRDPC
              | (youth organisation) in 1987. It is thus clear that this structural assimilation
              | of the Mbororo by the UNC-RDPC was, after all, marginal since they were
              | not vested with power in the higher echelons of the party hierarchy.
              | Lester W. Milbrath (1965: 18) has attempted to sketch out ranking indi-
              | ces of political participation in which the holder of an electoral mandate is
              | supposed to have covered all the other steps. But keeping in mind this
              | problem of “political participation” – which, in describing the hierarchy of
              | forms of political intervention, posits the existence of a continuum from
              | voting to the exercise of state power – it is important to note fragmentation
              | imposed by the division of political labour between the agents of the politi-
              | cal sphere and other social agents. Thus, reading the political sections of
              | newspapers, listening to political broadcasts on television and the radio, and
              | engaging in political discussions does not involve any participation in the
              | struggle for leadership positions in the state apparatus. These are in fact
              | signs of the attention paid to political events by people who can only be
              | considered spectators. The same logic can be applied to the case of a person
              | whose vote expresses a desire for social conformity. In contrast, actually

              | has been in power since 1982, the UNC became the RDPC.
              | The RDPC is organised into four tiers at the local level: the cell (at the bottom), the
              | local committee, the sub-section, and the section (at the top). Each organ has three

text          | part in activism within a party are different from the aforementioned activi-
              | ties not only because they are believed to be time-consuming; these are ac-
              | tivities that belong to other fields of social practice, usually performed by
              | professionals or social agents whose lives revolve around politics (Gaxie
              | 1978: 42).
              | Some questions emerge regarding the political participation of the
              | Mbororo: Unlike in the period of the single party, do multi-partyism and
              | political liberalisation now allow for the emergence of Mbororo candidates
              | in the national representative institutions? If so, what will the results be?
              | From the perspective of leadership, do the Mbororo have leaders and politi-
              | cal entrepreneurs likely to mobilise them? To what extent do they exercise
              | responsibility within political parties, both ruling and oppositional? Since the
              | first pluralist municipal elections, in 1996, more and more Mbororo have
              | competed for council positions and some have even managed to get elected.
              | Based on our field surveys, this political participation manifested itself, for
              | example, by the presence of 14 Mbororo candidates in the 2007 municipal
              | elections in the West, related to three political parties. Seven of those 14
              | were elected: one from the RDPC, the ruling party, two from the Social
              | Democratic Front (SDF), and four from the Union Démocratique du Came-
              | roun (UDC). Even more important, a Mbororo, Lerah Adamou of Didango,
              | became town councillor in Bafoussam, the regional metropolis, under the
              | aegis of the SDF. A closer inspection of the political participation of the
              | Mbororo in Noun Division is needed as they constitute here the largest
              | component of Mbororo in the West Region. Of particular importance is the
              | political career of Yerima Dairou, an elite Mbororo from Didango, who has
              | since died. In his day, he succeeded in mobilising his fellow Mbororo so that
              | they could play their part in the new political context.
              | Yerima Dairou and the Political Mobilisation of Mbororo
              | Upon the restoration of multi-partyism, the Mbororo of the Noun under the
              | leadership of Yerima Dairou, then a member of the Central Committee of
              | the UNDP (National Union for Democracy and Progress), were first in-
              | volved in the ranks of this party – the party of their “brother”, Bouba Bello
              | Maigari, a Fulani from the North and former prime minister of Cameroon.
              | Having been able to unite and mobilise the electorate around him, Yerima
              | Dairou became the undisputed political leader of the Mbororo in the Noun
              | and even in the West. In the legislative elections of 1992, he led the UNDP
              | list in the Noun, and the Mbororo voted overwhelmingly for this party.
              | With this allegiance, which combines ethnicity (Fulani) and political coalition
              | with the UNDP in a division controlled by the UDC party, the Mbororo
              | face off with the Bamun, most of whom are part of the UDC and the ad-

              | ministration allied with the ruling party, the RDPC. One Mbororo informant
              | claimed that for the Bamun, the Mbororo are only “strangers and enemies
              | to kill” and thus that it is necessary for the Bamun “to burn down [the
              | Mbororo’s] settlements, to destroy their pastures and to expel them from
              | the Noun”. As a result, the agro-pastoral conflicts are politicised and some-
              | times result in the deaths of Mbororo men and the destruction of pastures.
              | In some other places, they are simply prohibited access to waterways, the
              | aim being to prevent their use by livestock. The administration, in turn, has
              | raised the price for pasture access and even threatened to expel the Mbororo
              | to elicit their allegiance to the RDPC.
              | In 1995, the administration was also making use of its cunning. In the
              | hopes of getting Yerima Dairou to return to the ruling party, the admin-
              | istration agreed to appoint him village chief of Didango, a position his fol-
              | lowers believed for quite some time he should have already held. The timing
              | was not fortuitous. Because as village chief he would become an auxiliary of
              | the territorial administration and could not continue to alienate the admin-
              | istration by remaining in the opposition (the UNDP), he had to return to his
              | previous benefactor and support the RDPC. Moreover, almost all traditional
              | leaders in this division are committed to the cause of the RDPC, starting
              | with the most prominent of them, the sultan of the Bamun. In fact, Yerima
              | Dairou henceforth called himself “lamido” (like the Fulani chiefs in North-
              | ern Cameroon) and joined the ruling party. But as the Bamun majority are
              | committed to the UDC and fiercely oppose the RDPC, the Mbororo are still
              | caught between a rock and a hard place: the UDC and the RDPC.
              | Anxious to protect their interests, of which the most important is ac-
              | cess to pastureland, the Mbororo in Noun organised themselves strategically
              | between allegiance to the UDC and the RDPC. In the 1996 municipal elec-
              | tions, there were Mbororo candidates in the ruling party and the opposition
              | party. Seeing as how the UDC enjoy majority support in the Noun, the
              | Mbororo had believed that their support of the UDC would benefit them in
              | the fight against poverty, but that turned out to be an illusion.
              | Confronted with this misfortune, the Mbororo – while keeping a small
              | reserve of opposition in order to keep on good terms with their farming
              | Bamun neighbours – became a source of votes mainly for the RDPC, the
              | party they perceived as being more responsive to their needs and require-
              | ments. “The Mbororo support the ruling party because its supporters deal in
              | achievements and not promises,” says one Mbororo interviewee. According
              | to another interviewee, the UDC does not go deep enough in its diagnosis
              | to address the problems of the Mbororo in the Noun; this party is not aware
              | of the specific problems of this community. Yet, according to the same
              | interviewee, “There is a Mbororo problem in this terroir.” As for the RDPC,

text          | it is popularly associated with the intervention of the state apparatus. “The
              | administration opens schools, as they did in Yolo and Mbororo-Koutaba.
              | We have three schools with teachers and at least one headmaster.”11 In the
              | health field, the creation of health centres has facilitated access to health
              | care. The opposition criticises, opposes and proposes but is powerless to put
              | their policies into practice. The same interviewee from above says that “it is
              | better to [join] the ruling party, which deals in achievements”. The adminis-
              | trative authority recognises this marriage of convenience between the ruling
              | party and the Mbororo:
              | The Mbororo vote for the RDPC because in their eyes the regime is
              | seen as a liberator – with the [new] constitution [promoted by the
              | ruling party] that recognises their rights as a minority. In addition,
              | they have to safeguard their interests well protected by the regime. [...]

              | play an important part in the economy, which is in their interest to
              | safeguard.
              | Before his death, it was common to see Yerima Dairou at meetings of the
              | South-Central Noun Section of the RDPC in Koutaba at the invitation of
              | the elite in the Bamun RDPC. Each time he attended one of these meetings,
              | he took the floor to denounce the UDC and its supporters, using provoca-
              | tive words such as: “In the past, the Bamun said Mbororo were bushmen;
              | now under the banner of the RDPC, we have come out of the bush into the
              | light. It is the Bamun who today remain in the shadows with the UDC.” But
              | the UDC supporters see the Mbororo who support the RDPC as “merce-
              | naries”, whose support stems only out of the hopes of receiving state re-
              | sources (money, food, loincloths, T-shirts, gadgets, etc.). But Yerima Dairou
              | died in 2004, leaving the Mbororo of Noun Division somewhat orphaned.
              | Admittedly, the Mbororo have bureaucratic elites, but these are not political

              | These polling stations are mono-ethnic; we deliberately chose these because
              | this fact could well account for the current sympathy for the two main par-
              | ties held by the Mbororo. Today, with the routinisation of the multi-party
              | system, the logic of confrontation has given way to that of adaptation and
              | even mutual respect between the Mbororo and the Bamun. This extends to
              | all their farming neighbours in the West, even though cultural stereotypes,
              | the lack of leadership, and the educational deficit of the Mbororo continue
              | to marginalise them. The strategic political alignment of previous years has
              | been succeeded by the vote of convenience. Under these circumstances, the
              | ruling party has ensured its supremacy in the West. This domination is illus-
              | trated by the existence of specific RDPC cells and certain local committees
              | in some Mbororo encampments, at least in the Noun, where the low-level
              | party structures are numerically important (Didango, Kourom, Yolo,
              | Bagambi). Before 2007, the UDC had a few local committees in two or
              | three Mbororo encampments in the Noun; now there is only one left (in
              | Didango), which shares structural features with the RDPC. Our Mbororo
              | informants from Didango have also commented on how multi-partyism
              | contributed to the splitting up families and clans within the community, with
              | bad blood evolving between supporters of opposing parties.
              | Where representation in the leadership of political parties is concerned,
              | there is no Mbororo in the ruling authorities of the UDC or the SDF,
              | whether at the sub-divisional, divisional or regional level. In the RDPC,
              | (which has no regional representation), one single Mbororo, Mbounje Ada-
              | mou, is a member of the sub-section board in Bagambi in Noun Division.
              | This figure is astoundingly low considering that there are over one thousand

text          | Mbororo, Ahmet Abdallah, was elected president of the OJRDPC (the
              | youth branch of the ruling party) for the south-central section of the Noun,
              | located in Koutaba, beating out a Bamun candidate. Abdallah was re-elected
              | in 2007, this time by acclamation. He also remains the only Mbororo to
              | appear on an executive board of an RDPC section in Noun Division, a
              | division that has six sections and a total of 18 executive boards at the divi-
              | sion level divided among three branches: adults, women and youth. One
              | must also consider that each of the 18 executive boards has at least 17
              | members, so the Mbororo representation is insignificant compared to that
              | of other ethnic communities, native and non-native, especially the Tikar, the
              | Bamileke and the Northwestern nationals, even though the inclusion of
              | these groups is based on the ethnic makeup of the districts. However, Ah-
              | met Abdallah represents a qualitative step in the political representation of
              | the Mbororo as compared to their representation in the single-party period
              | when they were represented only at the lower levels of inferior governing
              | bodies, the cell and the local committee. Even though the RDPC structures
              | in the Mbororo encampments are mono-ethnic, this is not the case at the
              | level of higher bodies such as the sub-section and the section. In addition to
              | this, Ahmet Abdallah theoretically runs a multi-ethnic structure, although in
              | reality it is controlled by the Bamun.
              | Determinants of Mbororo Political Participation
              | We will now explore the factors that ensured the socio-political mutation of
              | the Western Mbororo. In this regard, three mutually inclusive factors seem
              | to be essential: first, a favourable legal and institutional environment; se-
              | cond, from the perspective of resource mobilisation, MBOSCUDA activism
              | – a new Mbororo social movement established in 1992 that works toward
              | the socio-political integration of this community; and finally, the structural
              | assimilation of ethnic groups into political parties.
              | Regarding the first factor, according to the legal-institutional frame-
              | work, the socio-political integration of minorities goes through a number of
              | institutional arrangements. From this perspective, respect for minority rights
              | requires special measures that would create prospects for these groups that
              | the absolute law of the majority tends to impair; with the principle of “equal
              | treatment for all”, some minorities always end up in the unfavourable posi-
              | tion of having to defend their interests. This may consist of institutional
              | engineering in the form of quotas, “affirmative action”, or even special
              | electoral divisions (see Safran 1994: 61-80). For example, electoral bounda-
              | ries in the US have often served racial minorities such as African-Americans,
              | enabling them to constitute on their own an electoral majority in one or
meta          | 86
text          | Ibrahim Mouiche
              | more constituencies. For this reason, after each US census, the courts must
              | adjust the layout of districts based on demographic trends that have oc-
              | curred over the past decade. Pascal Noblet sees in this political practice a
              | true path to “substantive equality” (Noblet 1993: 133).
              | In Cameroon, the political liberalisation of the 1990s culminated in a
              | constitutional reform on 18 January 1996, which establishes a decentralised
              | unitary state, recognises indigenous rights, and protects minorities. The
              | preamble of the Constitution explicitly states that the state shall ensure the
              | protection of minorities and shall preserve the rights of indigenous popula-
              | tions. Moreover, in Section X on regional and local authorities, Article 57 (2)
              | provides that the Regional Council, the legislative body of the region, “shall
              | reflect the various sociological components of the region”. Before this con-
              | stitutional reform, legislation on the organisation of municipal and legislative
              | elections passed in the 1990s had already established the requirement of
              | respect for “various sociological components” in the electoral districts: Arti-
              | cle 5 (4) of Law 91/020 of 16 December 1991, which established the condi-
              | tions for the election of MPs to the National Assembly, and Article 3 (2) of
              | Law 92/002 of 14 August 1992, which set the conditions for the election of
              | municipal councillors. This notion of “sociological components” essentially
              | boils down to “various ethnic components of the population”. This is also
              | the meaning that litigants in Cameroon have given it as part of legal actions
              | relating to municipal elections since 1996 (see Donfack Sokeng 2001: 30-31).
              | “Democracy”, a term often confused with political liberalisation, “pro-
              | tects minorities, [and tries] to integrate them. If there were no statutory and
              | constitutional provisions in their favour, no Mbororo at all would be repre-
              | sented in City Hall,” a local authority told us in an interview.12 This senti-
              | ment was confirmed by our informant, a member of the Mbororo political
              | elite: “Democracy strengthens the position of minorities, providing a way
              | out of their disadvantaged positions. It at least offers them the opportunity
              | to express themselves. With multi-partyism, we have some municipal coun-
              | cillors.”13
              | Regarding the second factor (the new Mbororo social movement,
              | MBOSCUDA), we refer to resource mobilisation theory, which “shows the
              | process by which a dissatisfied group assembles and invests resources in
              | pursuit of its own goals” (Oberschall 1973: 28). Mobilisation is an instru-
              | mental activity that is put into action once the goals are set – resources being
              | defined as the object of this activity. From this perspective, society, as op-

              | agents and social movements the necessary resources for action. “Society
              | provides the infrastructure used by industries of social movements and
              | other industries” (Zald and McCarthy 1977: 217).
              | In the case we are concerned with, and according to the Mbororo
              | themselves, the MBOSCUDA has done much through its awareness-raising
              | activities to further the population’s appropriation of their civil and political
              | rights (see Davis 1995: 225 ff.; Pelican 2008: 540-560). Reportedly, the
              | MBOSCUDA was particularly helpful in assisting the Mbororo psychologi-
              | cally. The name “Mbororo” is now accepted and internalised by the
              | Mbororo themselves whereas before, the term was a pejorative, a source of
              | frustration, and therefore rejected. The Mbororo previously preferred to be
              | called Fulani or Fula. The MBOSCUDA also helped to advance education
              | among the Mbororo. During the phase of awareness-raising, the
              | MBOSCUDA went everywhere: the hamlets, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.
              | All occasions were good opportunities to revamp Mbororo self-esteem: a
              | festive occasion anywhere, or a meeting in a cattle market – in short, wher-
              | ever the Mbororo could come together. The MBOSCUDA also relied on
              | the help and networks of the ardos. The MBOSCUDA urged the Mbororo to
              | attend school, to be vaccinated, to apply for the national identity card, to
              | obtain birth and marriage certificates – in short, they were taught their civil
              | and political rights and all that is inherent in human rights. The
              | MBOSCUDA has also provided the Mbororo with legal assistance. This
              | assistance is very salutary; previously when threatened with a lawsuit, a
              | Mbororo would be so alarmed that s/he would risk all her/his assets to
              | avoid losing the trial and her/his honour, but now the way of thinking has
              | changed. The MBOSCUDA also asked them to settle, to modernise stock
              | farming and to acquire land deeds in order to avoid being at the mercy of
              | the other farmers, who sometimes produce deeds issued after the settlement
              | of the Mbororo. The MBOSCUDA provides teaching materials, desks and
              | chairs in Mbororo schools, along with medical equipment and other neces-
              | sary items. Finally, the MBOSCUDA promotes a better recognition of the
              | Mbororo, in order that they achieve greater visibility and are able to actively
              | participate in national politics (including by their representation in govern-
              | ment).
              | The MBOSCUDA thus remains confined to an awareness-raising role
              | and does not formally associate with political parties.14 But by involving
              | traditional and administrative authorities (divisional officers and senior divi-

              | sional officers) as it does in its meetings, the MBOSCUDA’s presence guar-
              | antees the political integration of the Mbororo. To cite one example, the
              | Mbororo are included on the lists of candidates for election – with the help
              | of the administrative authorities, who have the great responsibility of en-
              | suring the compliance of political parties with the rights of minorities elabo-
              | rated in the Constitution. The MBOSCUDA seems even more active inter-
              | nationally. According to Michaela Pelican,
              | [The] MBOSCUDA has also been instrumental in redefining Mbororo
              | national citizenship. Alongside collaborating with international devel-
              | opment agencies, it has created links with transnational human and
              | minority rights organisations, including Amnesty International, Sur-
              | vival International, Minority Rights Group International, and the
              | World Intellectual Property Organization. This international backing
              | proved vital in contesting human rights abuses committed by state
              | agents against Mbororo individuals.
              | Furthermore, in line with the proclamation of the decade of ‘indige-
              | nous peoples’ (1995–2004) by the United Nations, [the] MBOSCUDA
              | promoted the Mbororo as an “indigenous minority” whose cultural
              | survival had to be protected. [...] In 2005 [the] MBOSCUDA was
              | granted special consultative status by the Economic and Social Council
              | of the United Nations (Pelican, 2008: 550-551).
              | As we can see, the perspective of resource mobilisation not only affects
              | partisan and formal political activity, but also helps us analyse the social
              | movements by giving central importance to their organisational structures,
              | the strategic interactions between organisations, and the relationship be-
              | tween organisations or social movements and their environment. It appeals
              | to rationality and argues that participation in a movement must be consid-
              | ered rational behaviour just like any other institutional behaviour. In this
              | regard, it adopts the opposite point of view to that of the classical model,
              | which considers social movements the effects of failure or malfunction of
              | the social system. The view adopted here is, on the contrary, based on the
              | premise that resource mobilisation with the aim of collective action is prob-
              | lematic and, as such, involves a cost and a benefit for any group wishing to
              | engage in political action (Arcand, 2003: 24).
              | Finally, the third factor is structuralism, seen here in terms of demo-
              | cratic culture within the parties based on Peter M. Leslie’s “structural assim-
              | ilation” – that is, the proportional distribution of ethnic groups in the
              | structures of (the aforementioned) political parties (Leslie 1969: 422). It is in
              | fact the political parties that put into practice the legislative and constitu-
              | tional requirements regarding minority rights and “sociological compo-
              | nents” of electoral districts, giving a few places to Mbororo community

text          | members in their organisational structures and their lists of candidates dur-
              | ing the nomination phase of elections. In most cases, it is less the integration
              | of minorities and more the political parties’ electoral interests that prevail,
              | the latter being manifested in electoral votes that they either get or expect to
              | get from the target population. The strategy of “proximity” (Stroh 2010) is
              | obviously central here. On the one hand, the Mbororo are politically apa-
              | thetic as we have outlined above. On the other hand, due to their demo-
              | graphically scattered population, the Mbororo are minorities wherever they
              | are located in the West and cannot alone influence the outcome of an elec-
              | tion in any locality. From what has been said, the political parties (here the
              | RDPC, SDF, and UDC) seem to be at the vanguard of democratic devel-
              | opment, as they have ensured the political representation of the Mbororo
              | despite the latter’s political apathy and demographic weakness.
              | However, the political parties in the opposition and the one in power
              | employ different strategies to win Mbororo votes. We noted during some
              | political meetings in the Noun that on the discursive level, the Mbororo do
              | not side with the criticism against the regime voiced by the opposition,
              | knowing that only the ruling party can find solutions to their most immedi-
              | ate and urgent problems. Taking the case of the Noun, a case that applies to
              | many other Mbororo localities as well, the Mbororo have over decades of
              | cohabitation learned the Bamun language, and some Bamun handle Fulani
              | with the greatest of ease. In setting up lists of candidates, UDC leaders usu-
              | ally confine themselves to co-opting some Mbororo in their lists through
              | their network of Bamun “beaters”, especially as there is no primary election
              | for the nomination of candidates in this party. During the electoral cam-
              | paigns, everything takes place in the village market (Bamun market), and
              | decisions are made in the Bamun language. Of course, care is taken to invite
              | a Mbororo candidate, to whom of course little attention is paid. Neverthe-
              | less, the UDC does campaign in Didango.
              | Concerning the RDPC, the situation is somewhat variable taking into
              | account the demographic data. Thus, in localities with high Mbororo con-
              | centrations (Bagambi, Didango, Kourom, Yolo, etc.), during electoral cam-
              | paigns (legislative, presidential and municipal), officials from the ruling party
              | generally do well by going to the encampments and communicating with the
              | Mbororo and their ardos. On such occasions, they no longer speak Bamun,
              | but rather Fulfulde, even if all the Bamun present do not understand this
              | language. Latitude is given to the Mbororo to express themselves, to present
              | their grievances – including their complaints – in the language of their
              | choice. In turn, RDPC officials take the opportunity to emphasise the gov-
              | ernment’s protection of minorities, to which the Mbororo belong, as being a

              | story as with the UDC: It all takes place in the village market square.
              | The Political Participation of Western Mbororo:
              | A Political Awakening?
              | Unlike in the single-party period, when it was difficult for them even to
              | vote, it is in terms of “political awakening” that the quantum leap made by
              | the Mbororo in the West must be described in this new context of political
              | liberalisation. Nevertheless, this awakening is not unique. Following the
              | example of the West, the neighbouring Anglophone Northwest is also full
              | of many Mbororo encampments, and one is struck by some parallels in
              | terms of their political participation. Like the West, the Northwest is a re-
              | gion of high plateaus with wet grassland vegetation: ideal pastureland. The
              | farmers here also hold an unchallenged demographic and political suprem-
              | acy over the Mbororo. The West and the Northwest combined constitute
              | the third-largest area for cattle breeding in Cameroon (see Boutrais 1984:
              | 225). Upon the restoration of multi-partyism, Northwestern Mbororo sup-
              | ported the UNDP party of Bello Bouba Maigari, though the area was con-
              | trolled by the opposition SDF. The crisis and development that followed
              | were not unlike those experienced in the same period by the Mbororo in
              | Noun. Only the amplitude of the conflict is different here: The Mbororo
              | were called upon to defend themselves and they also resorted to violence
              | against indigenous farmers, supporters of the SDF, as reported by Lucy
              | Davis:
              | During the recent changes in the direction of multi-party politics in
              | Cameroon, many of the Northwest Province Mbororo switched alle-
              | giance from their traditional support of Biya’s ruling CPDM party to
              | support of the Northern, Muslim politician Bouba Bello, then head of
              | the UNDP, the third-largest party. […]
              | During the state of emergency in October 1992, a number of
              | Mbororo compounds were attacked and burnt, large numbers of cat-
              | tle are claimed to have been attacked with machetes. The Mbororo
              | retaliated on horseback, attacking local villagers with their herding
              | staffs. Mbororo were not permitted to enter certain market towns and
              | had to buy their provisions through Hausa middlemen. These events
              | may indeed have helped lead the Mbororo into a more genuine,
              | growing movement towards Muslim unity in Northwest Province, al-
              | beit as yet independent from the North (Davis 1995: 221).
              | Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo
meta          | 91
text          | This tension highlights the ethnic dimension, especially the close relation-
              | ship between a feeling of identity, territorial control and political competi-
              | tion. It raises the fundamental questions of right to the soil, not of a partic-
              | ular individual, but of a group (Pourtier 1998: 139). But, as has been rightly
              | seen by Jean-François Bayart, Peter Geschiere and Francis Nyamnjoh, the
              | political moment when the assertion of autochthony occurs “undoubtedly
              | remains that of the democratisation of authoritarian regimes and of author-
              | itarian restoration strategies”, “two quasi-concomitant processes in the
              | 1990s, which, however, should not be confused” (Bayart, Geschiere and
              | Nyamnjoh 2001: 182-186). But what is remarkable here is that the opposi-
              | tion (the SDF in the Northwest and the UDC in Noun) participates in the
              | same authoritarian prism, by compelling the Mbororo to enrol in those
              | parties. With the routinisation of the electoral process, the Mbororo of the
              | Northwest became a source of votes for the RDPC as did the Mbororo of
              | the West. It is this RDPC–Mbororo alliance that the sub-divisional officer
              | of Jakiri (division of Bui, Northwest) who we interviewed during the field
              | surveys called “republican tradition”.
              | In addition, we have shown above that Mbororo society is not welded
              | or organised by a centralised political structure but rather built on the basis
              | of small clan units. This in addition to their individualism weakens their
              | position as a group capable of mobilising. Against this segmental trend,
              | Yerima Dairou, who was appointed chief of the village of Didango in 1995,
              | attempted to politically unify the Noun Mbororo and even the Western
              | Mbororo – a unification modelled on the Fulani lamidates of Northern
              | Cameroon – and he called himself lamido, thereby the paramount chief of
              | the ardos. Even though the undertaking was received favourably in Didango,
              | clan individualism still had too thick a skin among the ardos and the
              | Mbororo of other camps for all to acknowledge him. Besides, for such a
              | project to be truly successful, it would need the concomitant endorsement
              | of the administration and the sultan of Bamum. However, Dairou, as a
              | lamido – whose purpose is to rule over all the Mbororo in the Noun – com-
              | petes with that of the sultan of Bamum, which in the socio-political context
              | of the Bamun kingdom is unacceptable. Yerima Dairou’s father initially
              | attempted to get acknowledged by the colonial administration as lamido
              | (1915–1962), but he gave that pursuit up following independence. Among
              | other reasons, his decision was borne out of consideration, as no-one in the
              | kingdom of Bamun should have a power similar to that of the sultan (see
              | Salé 1991). In fact, the so-called “lamidate” of Didango confers only the
              | status of village chief (third degree), and its sphere of influence is confined
              | to Didango. Nevertheless, it represents an important reference point in the
              | traditional local power structure and especially for the inclusion of the

              | Mbororo. In the Northwest, a similar structure was created in 2001 with
              | varying degrees of success at Sabga near Bamenda.15
              | Like in Cameroon’s West, multi-partyism and democratisation have
              | opened new opportunities for the Mbororo of the Northwest. They are,
              | more and more, running for positions as municipal councillors and even
              | managing to win, drawing on the support of the new legal and institutional
              | architecture in favour of minorities that the MBOSCUDA has long worked
              | toward. It is not unimportant to note that the national president of the
              | MBOSCUDA, El Hadj Jaji Manu Gidado, prince of Sagba, is a native of the
              | Northwest and a high-ranking official (chargé de mission) at the presidency of
              | the republic. It was in this region in 2007 (and nowhere else in Cameroon to
              | date) that the Mbororo began to take decisive steps with regard to their
              | political integration, by registering one of their own in the municipal execu-
              | tive, the position of third assistant of the mayor in the town of Jakiri, under
              | the banner of the RDPC. Some Mbororo are also members of the CPDM
              | sections in the region, youth and adult branches; and in Jakiri, the vice-
              | president of the OJRDPC is a Mbororo.
              | From the perspective of “indigenous peoples”, one notes some homol-
              | ogies between the Mbororo and the Pygmies of the forest areas of central,
              | eastern and southern Cameroon. But it is above all the contrasts that prevail.
              | Like the Mbororo, a few Pygmies are now councillors in the municipalities
              | of the East and the South even though this was not the case before 2007
              | (see Tchoumba, Guechou Bouopda and Messe 2006; Nke Ndih 2010). Ob-
              | viously, the Pygmies should enjoy the same new legal-institutional frame-
              | work as the Mbororo. But this is unfortunately not the case: Without any
              | educational and intellectual background, Pygmies have no social movement
              | following the example of the MBOSCUDA, not to mention leaders or bu-
              | reaucratic elites. Unlike the Mbororo, who have some economic power
              | through cattle breeding, the Pygmies rather remain poor “savages” con-
              | stantly undermined and exploited by their Bantu neighbours. This exploita-
              | tion even borders on slavery and fortunately is constantly denounced by
              | NGOs. It is these NGOs and the state that are now trying to support the
              | Pygmies’ participation in several programmes.

              | Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo
meta          | 93
text          | Conclusion
              | We have just seen that, as long as elections within the one-party system
              | remained a simple ritual to legitimate rulers, those rulers did not need the
              | Mbororo; with multi-partyism and democratisation, where balloting changed
              | from a ritual vote to the process of actually electing rulers, the Mbororo of
              | the West have become political subjects and actors. And from the vicious
              | circle under the single party, this community is beginning its transition into
              | the virtuous circle by exercising its political rights, which were in former
              | times ignored or denied, and by assuming its citizenship completely as can-
              | didates in the municipal institutions, members of local hierarchies in political
              | parties, etc. These are the milestones considered from the qualitative – not
              | the quantitative – perspective that have led us to the conclusion about the
              | Mbororo political awakening. This transformation, comparable to that of
              | the Mbororo of the Northwest, is a result of three main factors: first, the
              | new legal-institutional architecture, which confirms the rights of minorities
              | and compels the different protagonists of the electoral process to respect
              | the “various sociological components” of the electoral constituencies; se-
              | cond, the role of the MBOSCUDA, a new social movement of the Mbororo
              | that works by raising awareness about how the Mbororo can appropriate
              | their civil and political rights; and third, the structural assimilation of ethnic
              | groups by the RDPC, UDC and SDF, which grant certain roles to the
              | members of this community in the structures of their organisations and their
              | lists of candidatures during nominations for the municipal elections. This
              | study highlights the central role of political parties in the social and political
              | integration of ethnic minorities as well as the role of social movements as
              | strategic activities for the purpose of entry into the political system and as
              | activities instrumental to the mobilisation of social groups or individuals
              | (Lapeyronnie 1988: 593).
              | It remains a fact, however, that the Mbororo in the West – as in the
              | rest of Cameroon – have not yet succeeded in transforming their political
              | awakening into real political victory; they have not taken over control of
              | local rule by becoming municipal executives in the region. There is only one
              | Mbororo deputy mayor in a country comprised of 360 municipalities and
              | therefore almost one thousand executive posts – this in addition to a “few
              | representatives in municipal councils that are there to decorate the gallery
              | and give the impression that they are taken into account” to use Fadimatou
              | Dahirou’s words. No Mbororo has ever been mayor and as of this moment
              | the doors of parliament are still closed to the Mbororo, despite the late
              | Yerima Dahirou of Didango having obtained in 1992 for the first time the
              | endorsement as parliamentary candidate of the Noun constituency for the
              | UNDP in the general elections. This experience is slow to repeat itself, and

              | therefore constitutional democracy is still struggling to truly penetrate the
              | political field in Cameroon. That is why among their grievances, the
              | Mbororo voice repeatedly that they want to have a member of their com-
              | munity appointed either a minister, or a representative in the National As-
              | sembly. The same would hold true for the senate and regional assemblies –
              | both institutions are stipulated in the constitution but have yet to be created.
              | The Mbororo are also advancing their demands to have local councillors
              | and mayors, arguing that they have the necessary “qualifications”. Finally,
              | there is no space to discuss the role of the arena (regional or national) for
              | the strategies and constraints of political participation by groups with a
              | common sense of belonging. We must also consider the contentious ques-
              | tion of whether all described acts of participation and contestation are in the
              | interests of the group, or simply boil down to an individual’s ambitions. This
              | contribution has chosen to look at political participation from the perspec-
              | tive of groups with a sense of common origin to provide a counterweight to
              | the (dominant) contributions that analyse the strategies of political parties
              | and “big men”; but these perspectives are not necessarily incompatible.

              | Zusammenfassung: Während der letzten zwei Jahrzehnte profitierten die
              | Mbororo – eine “marginalisierte” ethnische Gruppe – ganz unerwartet von
              | einer neuen Politik in der Westregion Kameruns. Folgende politische Ver-
              | änderungen hatten positive Auswirkungen für die Mbororo: die neuen ge-
              | setzlichen und institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen aufgrund der Verfas-
              | sungsänderung von 1996, die Folgen des politischen Wettbewerbs innerhalb
              | des Mehrparteiensystems seit 1990 und die Mobilisierung der Mbororo
              | durch eine nicht parteigebundene Vereinigung zur Förderung ihrer Interes-
              | sen als Ethnie, der 1992 gegründeten MBOSCUDA. Die Kombination die-
              | ser Faktoren führte zu einem politischen Erwachen der Mbororo. Der vor-
              | liegende Beitrag möchte zu einem besseren Verständnis der Bestimmungs-
              | faktoren und der wesentlichen Beteiligten an dieser Entwicklung beitragen.
