              | Abstract: The objective of the research is to identify the reality of integrating the dimensions of computerized health
              | information systems in Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex. The researchers used the questionnaire method to collect
              | data. The researchers used the random stratified sample method, where 30 samples were distributed to test the
              | internal consistency, structural validity and consistency of the questionnaire. After verifying the validity and
              | reliability of the questionnaire for the test, (220) questionnaires were distributed to the study community. A total of
              | 197 responses were retrieved with a return rate equal to (89.5%).
              | The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the averages of the sample of the
              | study on these areas and the domains combined due to the variables of (gender), (qualification), (place of work),
              | (years of service), (Job title). The results showed that there were statistically significant differences between the
              | mean of the sample of the study on these areas due to age for the benefit of those aged 40 years and over. The
              | results confirmed that there are statistically significant differences between the averages of the sample estimates of
              | the study on this field due to the nature of the work in favor of those whose nature is administrative. The results
              | showed that there are statistically significant differences between the average of the sample of the study sample on
              | these two fields due to the years of service in favor of those who have served for 10 years or more.
              | The study reached a number of recommendations including: The need to establish a specialized department of
              | computerized health information systems, with clear responsibilities, and includes technical and administrative
              | specialists and health personnel in the number and efficiency required, working as a team to implement mechanisms
              | of work in computerized health information systems and have direct contact with staff in clinics and divisions to
              | provide services and technical support as soon as possible with the best quality. Increase the support provided by
              | senior management to users by encouraging them to use computerized health information systems and
              | understanding their different needs. Interest in providing the material resources of the equipment and equipment
              | used in the computerized health information system. The need to use database systems in the administrative and
              | medical decisions in clinics and sections that have an impact in raising the effectiveness of decisions by improving
              | the quality.

              | 1. INTRODUCTION
              | Medical decisions face many challenges and difficulties because the volume of information and knowledge that
              | doctors and decision-makers in hospitals and health care centers must deal with on an ongoing basis has grown to a
              | point where it has become difficult to deal with them in purely traditional ways. Limits the intellectual capacity of
              | the human being and increases the analytical and predictive capabilities necessary in decision-making processes,
              | thereby increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of collection, storage, sorting and retrieval of information, and
              | raising the analytical capacity to evaluate and process information and alternatives Different times help to save time
              | and effort for making different decisions.
              | Computerized health information systems have become a major issue of concern to all managers in health
              | organizations. Health information systems and technology have brought distances far beyond human reach, and have
              | enabled the storage of digital, text, audio and images. This helps to provide information that is very important to
              | decision-makers. Health information systems play an important role in the practical life of health workers. They

              | Study of (Al-Dweik, 2010) aimed at determining the implications of the use of computerized health information
              | systems on the decision-making processes of the European Gaza Hospital, and determining the differences
              | between these effects on administrative decisions compared to medical decisions. The study also aimed at
              | analyzing the actual reality of the use of computerized health information systems in various departments and
              | the effects of using these systems on the fields of administrative and medical work. It also aimed to identify the
              | main obstacles and problems that limit their effectiveness, and identify the most important types of these
              | systems in terms of use. The study found that the number of members of the administrative and medical sample
              | who use computerized health information systems in their work was 121 out of 128 individuals (94.5%). The
              | descending order of types of computerized information systems used at the Gaza European Hospital is as
              | follows: functional information systems, office automation systems, document management, decision support
              | systems and top management information systems, messaging systems. The study showed that the computerized
              | health information system currently used in the European Gaza Hospital has a good impact on the fields of
              | medical and administrative work as well as medical and administrative decisions. There are differences between
              | the levels of impact of computerized health information systems on administrative decisions compared to
              | medical decisions and differences in favor of administrative decisions. The study also showed that there are
              | obstacles that limit the effectiveness of health information systems, the most important of which are: weak
              | funds required, lack of adequate training, lack of vision towards the need for comprehensive planning of
              | electronic health applications.
              | Study of (Al-Halabi, 2010) aimed at measuring the appropriateness of computerized information systems and
              | their impact on decentralization in the Ministry of Finance in the Gaza Strip. In order to achieve the objectives
              | of the study, a questionnaire was designed and developed for the purpose of collecting data and measuring study
              | variables. The sample consisted of (104) employees, 79 of which were retrieved, and the statistical package
              | (SPSS) was used to perform the statistical analysis of this study using the following statistical methods:
              | descriptive statistics, Siperman correlation coefficient and analysis of variance. The study found that the
              | requirements of computerized administrative information systems (physical, software, human, organizational)
              | are highly efficient from the point of view of the respondents. There is also a statistically significant relationship
              | between the computerized and decentralized administrative information systems in the Ministry of Finance in
              | the Gaza Strip. The study indicates that there is no statistically significant relationship on "the impact of
              | computerized administrative information systems on decentralization in the Ministry of Finance in the Gaza
              | Strip" due to the demographic variables (gender, age, experience, job qualification, scientific level).

              | Study of (Al-Saudi, 2006), the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Computerized Information
              | Systems on the performance of employees in the Social Security Institution. Data were distributed to the 369
              | members of the sample. The statistical methods were used to analyze the data. Statistical methods were used to
              | determine the perceptions of the sample members of the dimensions of information systems and performance,
              | the study model and the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable and the analysis of the single
              | variance. The study reached several results, the most important of which are: The perceptions of the respondents
              | regarding the requirements of operating the information system were high. The respondents' perceptions of the
              | job performance came to a medium degree. The impact of the main requirements for the management and
              | operation of the computerized, software, human, and organizational information system in the job performance.
              | The study showed that there are statistically significant differences in respondents' perceptions of the
              | requirements of operating the information system, due to the demographic variables (gender, age, academic
              | qualification, experience, and career level).
              | Study of (Abu Sabt, 2005) which aimed to assess the role of these systems in the decision-making process of
              | decision makers in Palestinian universities in the Gaza Strip. The study reached a number of results, the most
              | important of which is that the current information systems do not rise to expert systems where they do not
              | provide solutions to problems. And not to provide external statistical information and lack of direct contact with
              | the centers of statistics inside or outside the country. And that they have competence and managerial and
              | technical expertise that are very commensurate with the work assigned to them. And that the devices used in
              | universities are modern and highly efficient in Palestinian universities. And that there is a positive relationship
              | between the quality of information and the use of information systems in the decision-making process. And that
              | the programs used help to the flexible exchange of information among users of the system and the presence of
              | modern techniques in the systems used, including technical. And that there is a strong relationship between the
              | organizational level and the quality of decisions.
              | Study of (Ghoneim, 2004), which aimed to identify the role of Computerized Information Systems in the
              | decision-making process in the municipalities of the Gaza Strip. The study consisted of (11) municipalities in
              | the Gaza Strip. The study found several results, the most important of which are: a strong positive relationship
              | between the availability of the computerized management information systems infrastructure and the production
              | and use of information needed for decision making, the weak ability of the information system to cover aspects
              | of work including the material potential, the organizational level is suitable for the beneficiaries of the system,
              | The existence of clear plans for the functioning of the computerized administrative information system is a
              | major obstacle that hinders the implementation and development of administrative information systems in the
              | municipalities, and recommended the need for infrastructure, including human resources.

              | The World Health Organization (WHO) defined the computerized health information system as "the science of
              | acquiring, preserving, retrieving and applying biomedical knowledge and information to improve patient care,
              | education, research and management, as well as the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean" The use
              | of computing, networking and communication technology methodologies to support health-related areas such as
              | medicine, nursing and management (www.emro.who.int). This definition covers a wide range covering the
              | following areas: conservation, processing, retrieval and exchange of information Administrative and medical
              | decisions Support for administrative and medical decisions Save the radiological image analysis and clinical signs
              | electronically Provide scientific models and telemedicine, defined in the Scientific Encyclopedia of Information
              | Systems As information systems consisting of computer hardware, software, procedures and processes specifically
              | designed to collect, process, store and manage information related to health care delivery, in order to support
              | Medical Management (Wickramasinghe& Geisler, 2008).
              | The health organizations exercise their functions in a specific organizational environment and within a framework or
              | organizational structure with its characteristics and specifications. Within this regulatory framework, medical,
              | therapeutic, preventive and various administrative aspects that serve the medical and health aspects Jad AL-Rab
              | (2009), Al-Dweik (2010) defined it as a set of elements, procedures and means that record, process, save, retrieve
              | and distribute information to support health care organizations where this information can be divided into health
              | information and management information. "Health information systems in the scientific encyclopedia are defined as
              | information systems Consisting of Computer hardware, software, procedures and processes specifically designed to
              | collect, process, store, and manage information related to health care delivery, to support medical and administrative

              | Dimensions of computerized health information systems:
              | 1. Types of health information systems used:
              | A. Medical Information System (MIS)
              | Jad AL-Rab (2009), is an important subsystem that makes the overall system of the hospital a meaningful social and
              | human organization. Therefore, this system affects the overall performance of the hospital, without information that
              | is not made, and without information, there is no communication the author is not overly efficient. He says that
              | without information, there is no effective organization. The information is the clean blood flowing, which stimulates
              | the arteries and veins of multiple and interconnected organizations, and the importance of medical information
              | systems in raising the efficiency of medical and organizational performance in health organizations.
              | B. Medical Records Information System and its benefits for health organizations:
              | The concept of JAD AL-Rab (2009) is a concept developed in the field of information systems in general and in the
              | area of health organization management in particular. It is defined as "one of the integrated information systems of
              | the hospital-wide integrated information system Data on the disease as well as on the units and departments
              | responsible for the provision of therapeutic and medical services in the hospital and then tabulation, operation,
              | treatment, storage and retrieval of the data to be used primarily in the decision-making and medical use for the
              | purposes of legal education and training and guidance of the Medical Authority and My research, medical and
              | administrative studies in health organizations.
              | 2. Equipment and devices used:
              | The devices as defined by (Kundalji and Al-Janabi, 2009) include all the various types of physical components and
              | media used in the processes in which the data and information pass. The hardware or hardware does not include
              | computers and other devices, but also all the media and visible objects on which data are recorded Pages and pieces
              | of paper to extract information onto magnetic or optical disks.
              | 3. The databases used
              | Al-Najjar (2005) stated that databases are a logical organization of clusters of interconnected files where data are
              | integrated and inter-related, making it easy to find information to achieve the desired objectives, and data are
              | arranged and stored in a typical way Data avoidance is avoided.
              | 4. Networks:
              | The networks include long-range communications and communications technologies, and various types of networks,
              | such as the Internet, intranet, and extranets, which have become important in managing successful e-business and
              | business operations of all kinds, through its Kundalji and Al- Janabi, (2009). Local networks use cables of various
              | types, including dual-channel telephone wires, single or multichannel cable and high-performance fiber optics (Al-
              | Salmi and Al-Salmi, 2005).
              | 5. Supporting senior management:
              | The effectiveness of the system depends on the support of the senior management of the organization served by the
              | system, whether at the level of data inputs or the level of its policy outputs and without support at the level of either
              | system does not lead (Al-Moghrabi, 2002)
              | 6. Users of the system:
              | The availability of human skills and competencies, training, development and motivation is one of the most
              | important pillars for achieving the goals of the institution. Achieving success requires dedicating attention and care
              | to individuals starting with the process of selection, appointment, performance evaluation, training and development
              | programs, and motivational methods to seek to prove the differences in work, participation, For the purpose of
              | achieving continuous improvement in performance (Hamoud, 2005), system users are the individuals who use the
              | system or the information produced by the system (Kundalji and Al-Janabi, 2009). System users can also be defined
              | here as specialists Technicians: Individuals, who develop, operate and manage the information system technically
              | (Kundalji and Al-Janabi, 2009).
              | 10. FIELD STUDY
              | First- Methodology of the study:
              | In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the researchers used the descriptive analytical method in which he
              | tries to describe the phenomenon of the subject of the study, analyzing its data, the relationship between its
              | components and the opinions that are raised around it, the processes it contains and the effects it causes.
              | Second- Society and Study Sample:
              | The society of the study is defined as all the vocabulary of the phenomenon studied by the researchers. Based on the

              | The sample was randomized to a sample of 30 samples to test the internal consistency, structural honesty and
              | stability of the questionnaire. After confirming the validity of the questionnaire, 220 samples were distributed to the
              | study population (89.5%).
              | Third: The Study Tool:
              | The instrument of study means that the tool measures what has been set for its measurement. The veracity of the
              | questionnaire has been verified by the following methods:
              | 1. Validity from the point of view of the arbitrators:
              | The questionnaire was presented to a number of specialized arbitrators in order to ascertain the accuracy of the
              | linguistic language of the questionnaire, the clarity of the instructions of the questionnaire, the affiliation of the
              | paragraphs to the dimensions of the questionnaire and the validity of this tool to measure the objectives associated
              | with this study. The arbitrators looked.
              | 2. Internal Validity
              | The consistency of the internal consistency of each paragraph of the questionnaire with the area in which this
              | paragraph belongs is true. The researchers calculated the internal consistency of the questionnaire by calculating the
              | correlation coefficients between each paragraph of the question domains and the total score of the field itself.
              | Fourthly- Reliability of the study instrument Reliability:
              | The questionnaire is consistently meant to "give the questionnaire the same results if repeated several times.
              | The researchers investigated the stability using Alpha Cronbach's Coefficient equation. The researchers used the
              | Alpha Cronbach method to measure the stability of the questionnaire. The results were as shown in Table 1.

              | Table (3) shows that 73.6% of the study sample is male, while the remaining 26.4% is female. The researchers
              | attributed this to the fact that the Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex is the main compound in the Gaza Strip and there
              | are the outpatient departments and the central departments so most of the competencies of human resources are
              | located within the compound of Dar Al-Shifa for the great work pressure during the twenty-four hours and since
              | both gender do the same work, On the same requirements of computerized health information systems. As a result,
              | females prefer to work within the primary health care centers and clinics in the regions, and prefer to avoid as far as
              | possible the places that suffer from work pressure and friction with the public as the society is male dominant, and

              | And 35.0% of the study sample was under 30 years of age, 32.0% were aged 30-40 years and 22.3% were aged 40-
              | 50 years, 10.7% (50 years) and more. The researchers attribute this to the diversity of the average age, which
              | indicates the availability of expertise. It is also noticed that 79.3% of the study population is less than (50) years old,
              | and this is because the Palestinian society is young and young.
              | (13.7%) have an average diploma, 60.9% have a bachelor's degree, 18.8% hold a master's degree, and 3.6% hold a
              | PhD degree, Where the researchers note from the previous results that (74.6%) of the society of the study of holders
              | of a bachelor's degree and diploma. The researchers attributed this to the fact that most jobs in Dar Al-Shifa require
              | a minimum diploma for administrative, medical and medical support, and a bachelor's degree for medical posts.
              | (33.0%) of the study respondents said that the nature of their work is administrative, while (67.0%) the nature of
              | their work is a health administration. The researchers attribute this to the fact that Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex is
              | the largest medical and health center in the Gaza Strip, Central, and drug stores, so it is normal that the majority of
              | the study group of health administrators.
              | (12.7%) of the study sample work in outpatient clinics, while 87.3% work in the departments. The researchers
              | attribute that the Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has the main sections that serve all the citizens of the Gaza Strip.
              | All hospitals in the Gaza Strip, primary care centers, specialized surgeons, and specialist care departments and
              | referral sections for patients who need clinical care. Outpatient clinics are for patients who complain of various
              | diseases in the Gaza Strip.
              | (27.9%) of the sample study years of service less than (5) years, (28.4%), the years of service ranging from (5) to
              | less than (10) years, while (43.7%) years of service (10). The researchers attributed this to the fact that the largest
              | percentage is for those with experience. The percentage of workers who have more than 5 years of employment is
              | 72.1%. This is due to the stability of the labor force provided by the Ministry of Health to its employees. The staff of
              | the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which represents their safety compared to private clinics and civil centers.
              | And (7.1%) of the sample of the study named their job title department manager and above, (45.7%) head of
              | department, (7.6%) administrative head, while (39.6%) their administrative job title, And since the Dar Al-Shifaa
              | complex is a medical complex, it is natural that the owners of the administrative functions of the medical and health
              | personnel who hold managerial positions are more than the administrative staff.
              | Analysis of question paragraphs:
              | To analyze the resolution paragraphs, a single sample T test was used to determine whether the average response
              | score had reached the intermediate approval level (3) or not.
              | Zero Hypothesis: The mean response is equal to (3) and corresponds to the average degree of approval according to
              | the Likert scale.
              | Alternative Hypothesis: The average response score is not equal to (3).
              | If Sig <0.05 (Sig is greater than 0.05), the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. In this case, the average of the
              | individuals' opinions on the phenomenon studied is not substantially different from the average degree of approval
              | (3). 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted that the average views of
              | individuals differ substantially from the average approval level (3). In this case, it is possible to determine whether
              | the average response substantially increases or decreases the degree of intermediate approval. By means of the value
              | of the test. If the value of the test is positive, it means that the arithmetic mean of the answer exceeds the degree of
