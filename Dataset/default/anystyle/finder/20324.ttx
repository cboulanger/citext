              | Abstract A common feature in the empirical literature of intra-industry trade is
              | the analysis of trade between a given reference country and a set of partners. This
              | article differs from previous studies by examining the bilateral trade among all
              | trading partners within a set of partners. Using a panel data approach, we ﬁnd that
              | differences in factor endowments seem not to be important as a driving force behind
              | vertical intra-industry trade for European countries over the chosen period. More
              | important driving forces are production size, geographical proximity, average
              | income per capita and income distribution overlap.

              | 1 Introduction
              | Trade between two countries within a product category is characterized as intra-
              | industry trade (IIT) if both export and import exist, and IIT is characterized as
              | horizontal (HIIT) if trade consists of varieties of the same quality, and as vertical
              | (VIIT) if the varieties are of a different quality. Empirical research1 points out that
              | VIIT is the dominant type of total IIT.
              | A common feature of the above mentioned investigations is the analysis of trade
              | between a given reference country and a set of partners. The empirical results are

              | not unambiguous with regard to the relationship between differences in factor
              | endowments between trade partners on the one side and the two types of IIT on the
              | other. It is possible that the estimated relationships depend on the reference country.
              | Therefore, it is relevant to examine the bilateral trade among all partners within a set
              | of partners. Such an analysis has not yet been conducted in the international
              | literature. We conduct an econometric analysis of European VIIT in manufactured
              | goods from 1996 to 2005. The countries are the EU-15 countries and four East
              | European countries: Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic. The choice
              | of countries is determined by two considerations: (1) the availability of data for both
              | trade ﬂows and explanatory variables and (2) the countries should operate on a
              | common market so that problems of trade barriers etc. can be left out of
              | consideration. We also analyze the implications of geographical proximity. This
              | determinant captures such factors as similarities in language and culture and thereby
              | similarity of consumer patterns. Finally, we investigate the role of income
              | distribution overlap between countries and the effect of production size.
              | In Sect. 2, theoretical foundations and empirical applications are discussed. The
              | measurement of IIT is worked through in Sect. 3, and after some preliminary
              | investigations in Sect. 4, explanatory variables and hypotheses are listed in Sect. 5.
              | The results of the econometric estimations are shown in Sects. 6, and 7 concludes
              | the article.
              | 2 Theoretical foundations
              | In this section, we discuss theoretical foundations of determinants that may explain
              | VIIT. We discuss the effect of income distribution overlap, difference in factor
              | endowment, production size and geographical proximity. By capital endowment we
              | mean physical capital, technological capital as well as human capital. In the
              | analysis, we discuss both the demand side and the production side.
              | The theoretical framework of VIIT is rooted in the work of Linder (1961)
              | although he did not use the term VIIT explicitly. Linder assumes that the individual
              | demand for quality of a given variety is increasing with income. Considering two
              | countries, an overlap in income distribution determines whether the demand for a
              | given good will exist in both countries. Within this overlap, consumers with low
              | incomes demand low-quality varieties, whereas high-income consumers demand
              | high-quality varieties. However, the overlap in income distribution can be so small
              | that low quality goods demanded in the low-income country are not demanded in
              | the high-income country. The same applies to high-quality goods. Therefore, a
              | variety on a given quality level is not demanded in both countries, and then VIIT in
              | this good cannot exist2. Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987), Flam and Helpman (1987),
              | Stokey (1991) and Copeland and Kotwal (1996) also assign a central role to income
              | distributions. Moreover, the level of income per capita is determined by the capital
              | intensity, thus the capital-abundant countries have a relatively high income per
              | 2 Linder (1961), Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987), Stokey (1991), Copeland and Kotwal (1996) and
              | Murphy and Shleifer (1997).

              | Our ﬁrst hypothesis is
              | H1: We expect VIIT to be more prominent among countries with a high degree of
              | income distribution overlap.
              | Turning to the production side, the quality level of a product variety increases
              | with capital intensity. If a given good is produced in two countries, one of which is
              | capital-abundant and the other is labor-abundant (or less capital-abundant), we may
              | assume that the capital-abundant country produces high-quality varieties, whereas
              | the labor-abundant (or the less capital-abundant) country produces low-quality
              | varieties. Depending on the demand in the two countries, as discussed above, VIIT
              | will arise3. Many authors in empirical analysis expect a positive relationship
              | between VIIT and differences in factor endowments, see e.g. Durkin and Krygier
              | (2000), Mart´ın-Montaner and R´ıos (2002), Mora (2002), Crespo and Fontoura
              | (2004) and Zhang et al. (2005). However, it is not sufﬁcient to look at the
              | production side; the demand side needs to be included too as discussed above. Since
              | a large difference in factor endowments between two countries also indicates a large
              | difference in income per capita, we may even expect VIIT to be small in case of a
              | too large difference in factor endowments.
              | When we turn to the empirical evidence of the effect of differences in factor
              | endowments on VIIT, Mart´ın-Montaner and R´ıos (2002) and Mora (2002) use the
              | three above mentioned variables as a proxy of capital: physical capital, technolog-
              | ical capital and human capital.4 Mart´ın-Montaner and R´ıos (2002) ﬁnd a positive
              | relationship between VIIT and the three variables, whereas Mora (2002) ﬁnds a
              | negative relationship between VIIT and physical capital. The two other capital
              | variables show a positive relationship, although not signiﬁcant, as regards human
              | capital. Durkin and Krygier (2000) investigate HIIT and VIIT in relation to physical
              | capital and use as a proxy of the latter, GDP per capita. They ﬁnd a positive
              | relationship with VIIT. One the one hand, some of the estimated relationships are
              | insigniﬁcant, depending on how IIT is separated into HIIT and VIIT. Crespo and
              | Fontoura (2004) also use GDP per capita as a proxy of physical capital and ﬁnd a
              | positive relationship with VIIT. On the other hand, Gullstrand (2002b), who also
              | uses GDP per capita as a proxy of physical capital, expects a negative relationship
              | with VIIT. However, his empirical results do not support any explanatory power of
              | differences in factor endowments. Finally, it cannot be ruled out that differences in
              | factor endowments at industry level have a different impact on VIIT. Mora (2002:
              | pp 308–310) ﬁnds that at industry level for some industries the relationship is
              | positive and for other industries negative with regard to differences in factor
              | endowments. Since we chose VIIT as an aggregated index over industries, the
              | heterogeneity of industries in relation to a trading partner country has implications
              | for the direction of the relationship between the absolute difference in factor
              | endowments and VIIT. In other words the effect of differences in factor

              | (1995), Copeland and Kotwal (1996) and Murphy and Shleifer (1997).
              | 4 More precisely, Mora (2002) investigates high-quality VIIT.

              | endowments is not equal for all countries. Therefore, country-speciﬁc effects of
              | differences in factor endowments have to be investigated too. It appears that the
              | empirical results are not unambiguous as regards the relationship between
              | differences in factor endowments and VIIT. This is also conﬁrmed in an analysis
              | by Jensen and Lüthje (2008). Hence we can introduce our second hypothesis
              | H2: The effect of differences in factor endowments on VIIT depends on trade
              | partners.
              | The size of an economy matters too. The greater the size of an economy is, the
              | more industries will exist due to economies of scale. In order for VIIT to exist in a
              | given good, both trading partners have to produce the good. A given good will more
              | likely be produced in a large economy than in a small economy due to diversity of
              | industries. Our third hypothesis is
              | H3: The larger the production size of the trading partners is, the larger VIIT will
              | be.
              | A pair of countries with very different industry structures and/or demand patterns
              | will necessarily have a lower VIIT than a pair of countries with coincident industry
              | structures and/or demand patterns. Since countries that are close to each other
              | geographically will tend to have relatively similar industry structures and demand
              | patterns due to e.g. linguistic and cultural similarities, VIIT may be larger among
              | such pairs of countries (see also Linder 1961). Furthermore, the information costs
              | increase with geographical distance thereby hampering VIIT. Finally, geographical
              | proximity also reﬂects transportation costs. The smaller the transportation costs are,
              | the larger is VIIT. In fact, a robust empirical ﬁnding is that IIT and accordingly
              | VIIT decline with distance between trading partners (for further details see
              | Venables and Rice 2003). Accordingly, we can formulate our fourth hypothesis
              | H4: A. The more similar industry structures between the pair of trading countries
              | are, the larger is VIIT.
              | B. The more similar demand patterns are between the pair of trading
              | countries are, the larger is VIIT.
              | C. The smaller the information and transportation costs between the pair of
              | trading countries are, the larger is VIIT.
              | 3 Measurement of intra-industry trade
              | IIT between two countries of a product category j is measured by the Grubel and
              | Lloyd (1975) index:

              | j, |Xj - Mj| the net trade, (Xj ? Mj) is the value of the total trade. Accordingly, the

              | Fontagnéand Freudenberg (1997) and Greenaway et al. (1995) separate
              | vertically differentiated products from horizontally differentiated products by the
              | use of a dispersion factor of 15 or 25%. In order to evaluate the robustness of the
              | results, Greenaway et al. (1995), Aturupane et al. (1999), Durkin and Krygier
              | (2000), Gullstrand (2002a), Mora (2002) and Crespo and Fontoura (2004) conduct a
              | regression analysis for both dispersion factors and ﬁnd that the results are not
              | particularly sensitive as regards the chosen dispersion factor. See Nielsen and Lüthje
              | (2002) and Lüthje (2003) for a further discussion of this method.
              | The index of IIT is calculated from data from OECD’s CD-ROM database
              | International Trade by Commodities Statistics HS, 1996–2005 for manufactured
              | goods at a 6-digit product level of the harmonized system (HS) nomenclature (see
              | Table 5 in the Appendix).
              | 4 Preliminary investigations
              | An IIT index measuring intra-industry trade between two countries should remain
              | invariant if it is calculated from trade data reported by a certain country or by data
              | reported from its trade partner due to the symmetry of the formulas. To see whether
              | this is the case, correlations between IIT indices based on trade data reported by a
              | country and data reported by its partner are shown in Table 1.

              | With respect to Ireland, Greece and Hungary, the reported trade data are not in
              | accordance with the ﬁgures reported by the partners as regards HIIT. The problem
              | may be caused by erroneously reported trade quantities. These are used to calculate
              | unit values that serve as a basis to separate horizontal trade from vertical. As regards
              | IIT, only trade amounts are used and the two sets of reported indices seem to be
              | reasonably in accordance for all countries. Since correlations of VIIT indices based
              | on report country and partner countries are high, it is reasonable to use an average of
              | the VIIT index of a report country and the partner country as the report country as
              | our measure of VIIT. According to our data, VIIT is the more dominant type of IIT
              | within European trade. Calculating the fraction of VIIT of total IIT, we found an
              | average of 81%.
              | In Table 2, the average bilateral VIIT from 1996 to 2005 is shown. On the
              | one hand, countries such as Germany, France and Great Britain have a relatively
              | high VIIT with the European countries as a whole. These countries are
              | characterized by being at the same economic and cultural level and by being
              | large economies. The bilateral VIIT between these countries is at a higher level
              | than with other countries. On the other hand, countries such as Greece, Portugal,
              | Finland, Ireland, Poland and Slovakia have a relatively low bilateral VIIT.
              | Furthermore, it appears from Table 2 that geographical proximity matters.
              | Countries far from each other have lower VIIT than countries close to each
              | other.

text          | 5 Explanatory variables and hypothesis
              | L. Jensen, T. Lüthje
              | In this section, we operationalize the following explanatory variables: factor
              | endowment, production size, proximity, income distribution overlap and average
              | GDP.
              | 5.1 Explanatory variables
              | 5.1.1 Income distribution overlap
              | A measure of the income distribution overlap between two countries is calculated
              | as follows: Let p1 denote the proportion of the population in the poorer country
              | that has an income below the 20% quintile of the income distribution of the richer
              | country. Furthermore, let p2 denote the proportion of the population in the richer
              | country that has an income above the 80% quintile of the income distribution in
              | the poorer country. If the income distribution overlap is small, then both p1 and p2
              | will be large. If income distributions are identical, i.e. with full overlap, then both
              | p1 and p2 will be 20%. As a measure of income distribution overlap, INCO, we
              | calculate
              | p1þp2
meta          | 2
text          | 0:2
              | INCO ¼ 1
              | 0:7
              | The factor 0.7 in the denominator is due to the calculation of p1 and p2 from
              | income distribution data that are in the form of deciles. Then the maximum of p1
              | and p2 is 0.9. In practice, the minimum value of INCO is 0 indicating virtually
              | no overlap in income distributions. If income distributions are identical, then
              | INCO is 1.
              | Income distribution data for the European countries are calculated partly from
              | income share data (household disposal income earned within each decile) in World
              | Income Inequality Database (WIID 2C) for a single year (around 1999 for most
              | countries) and partly from GDP per capita data from OECD in 2000 dollars and
              | purchasing power parties (PPP). From the two sources deciles of income
              | distribution can be interpolated. A similar calculation is used by Durkin and
              | Krygier (2000).
              | 5.1.2 Factor endowment
              | As in Mart´ın-Montaner and R´ıos (2002) and Mora (2002), we decompose capital
              | into three variables: physical capital, technological capital and human capital.
              | We measure the endowment of human capital by the fraction of the population,
              | 25–64 years of age that has attained at least upper secondary education. This is a
              | commonly used measure of human capital; see e.g. Barro and Lee (1993), Mora
              | (2002) and Gullstrand (2002a, b). Data is from Eurostat’s Internet database for the
              | period from 1996 to 2005. Accordingly, the difference in the endowment of human
              | capital, DHKL, is measured by the absolute difference between the fraction of the
              | population that has attained at least upper secondary education.

text          | Technological capital, TK, is measured by the cumulated value of R&D
              | expenditures, see e.g. Coe and Helpman (1995) and Mora (2002), and is calculated
              | by the use of the perpetual inventory method as follows
              | TKt ¼ ð1
              | dÞTKt 1 þ RDEt 1
              | TKt is the technological capital for the year t, and d is the depreciation rate which
              | is assumed to be 15%.5 RDE is R&D expenditure estimated in 2000 US$ and PPP
              | and is based on data from the OECD. The initial technological capital stock, TK0, is
              | calculated as
              | TK0 ¼ RDE0=ð1 þ dÞ
              | where RDE0 is R&D expenditure in the ﬁrst year, and l is the average annual
              | logarithmic growth rate of R&D expenditures over the analyzed period. The
              | technological capital for each year is divided by the level of employment to obtain
              | the technological capital stock per worker, TKL. Thereby, the difference in the
              | endowment of technological capital can be measured by the absolute difference in
              | technological capital per worker, DTKL.
              | The physical capital per worker, PKL, is in 2000 US$ and PPP. As in Leamer
              | (1984) the physical capital is measured by the depreciated sum of cumulated gross
              | domestic investment using the perpetual inventory method. We use data from 1970
              | to 2007 from the OECD, and the depreciation rate is 7%.6 Thereby, the difference in
              | the endowment of physical capital can be measured by the absolute difference in
              | physical capital per worker, DPKL.
              | 5.1.3 Production size
              | The production size of a country is normally measured by the country’s GDP, see
              | e.g. Crespo and Fontoura (2004), but, as the focus of the analysis is on the industrial
              | production, GDP is too broad a measure. A more suitable measure of a country’s
              | production size in relation to its trading partners seems to be the country’s share of
              | the total industrial production of all the analyzed countries, p. Accordingly, we
              | measure the production size of a country by the country’s share of the total
              | industrial production of the analyzed European countries. We use OECD data for
              | the year 2001.The logarithm of the average share of production between partner
              | countries is denoted ASP.
              | ASP ¼ log
              | p1 þ p2
meta          | 2
text          | where pi is country i’s share of production.
              | 5 See Coe and Helpman (1995). Alternative measures of technological capital were also calculated
              | assuming d to be 5 and 10% with similar results (Coe and Helpman 1995: pp 883–886). Mora (2002)

              | L. Jensen, T. Lüthje
              | In a European context, geographical proximity captures similarities in partly
              | language and culture, and thereby similarity of consumer patterns, and partly
              | industry structures. Furthermore, geographical proximity also reﬂects information
              | and transportation costs. The more similar countries are and the smaller the
              | transportation costs are, the larger is VIIT. We measure geographical proximity by
              | DISTANCE: distance between capitals.7

              | In the analysis, we also include the average GDP per capita between two countries,
              | AGDPC, i.e. between country a and country b as

text          | A higher standard of living will lead to a higher demand for differentiated
              | products and thereby a higher VIIT (see Gullstrand 2002a: pp 328–331).
              | Furthermore, since Gullstrand (2002b) and Crespo and Fontoura (2004) ﬁnd an
              | interaction between difference in income distribution within countries (measured as
              | difference in GINI coefﬁcients) and difference in GDP per capita, we may suspect
              | the effect of AGDPC to depend on INCO. The sign of the interaction will be
              | determined empirically.
              | 5.2 Model
              | Some of the explanatory variables from the present panel data set are time-
              | dependent (DPKL, AGDPC, INCO, DHKL and DTKL) while others are time-
              | invariant (ASP and DISTANCE). Since VIIT is bounded between 0 and 100%, a
              | linear model will not guarantee expected values between these limits. Consequently,
              | a logistic transformation of VIIT is employed. The data are analyzed by means of
              | (mixed) linear models of the form (see e.g. Frees 2004):

              | independent variables (including a constant to capture an intercept). ai captures
              | country pair-speciﬁc effects (omitted time-invariant explanatory variables), and e
              | is a stochastic residual. The models cannot handle the extreme values 0 and 100%,
              | but such values do not occur in the data set. According to the model, the
              | regression coefﬁcients in b1i may eventually depend on the variable country pair.
              | Hence, the model permits interaction between country pair and the time-dependent
              | explanatory variables.

text          | 6 Econometric estimations
              | A problem with panel data models, as speciﬁed in model (5), is the possible
              | correlation between a and the explanatory variables (see e.g. Hausman and Taylor
              | 1981). Treating a as a random variable (a variance component), generalized least
              | squares (GLS), in the case of correlation between a and the explanatory variables,
              | results in biased and inconsistent estimates of regression coefﬁcients (Hausman and
              | Taylor 1981). A possible solution to overcome such a problem is to use so-called
              | ‘‘within’’ estimates of regression coefﬁcients where the ai’s are treated as ﬁxed
              | constants that enter the model in the form of dummy variables. These ‘‘within’’
              | estimates are unbiased and consistent even in the presence of correlation between a
              | and the explanatory variables. However, by this procedure it is not possible to
              | estimate effects of the time-invariant explanatory variables. Then if the analysis
              | indicates correlation between a and the explanatory variables, a robust estimation
              | procedure has to be sought out. Yet another problem with panel data models of type
              | (5) is the possibility of heteroscedasticity of the residual e as well as correlations of
              | some form among country pair residuals. We address this problem by using robust
              | standard errors (White 1980; Liang and Zeger 1986) in the estimation of standard
              | errors. In some of the models, we allow for serial correlation. All the models are
              | estimated by maximum likelihood.
              | The results of the econometric estimations are shown in Table 3 with a dispersion
              | factor d = 15%, and in Table 4 with a dispersion factor d = 25%. In column (1) in
              | Table 3, a model neglecting the variance component a is estimated by OLS. In case
              | of no correlation between a and the explanatory variables, OLS will result in
              | unbiased and consistent estimates of regression coefﬁcients, although standard
              | errors of the estimates are upward biased and thus not reliable. In case of correlation
              | between a and the explanatory variables, the estimates are biased and inconsistent
              | (Hausman and Taylor 1981). In column (2) ‘‘within’’ estimates are displayed. The
              | large discrepancies between the two sets of estimates indicate a problem with
              | correlation between a and the explanatory variables. In column (3) GLS estimates
              | are shown. A Hausman speciﬁcation test (Hausman 1978) based on a model (ﬁxed
              | effect and random component) with homoscedacity and no serial correlation has a
              | v2-value of 15.29. With 6 degrees of freedom the p-value is 0.018 thus indicating a
              | problem with correlation between a and the explanatory variables. Accordingly, the
              | models (1) and (3) can not serve as reference for inference concerning effects of the
              | explanatory variables.
              | Since model (2) does not permit time-invariant explanatory variables, we
              | estimate an ‘‘augmented’’ regression model (4)
              | yit ¼ X1itb1 þ X2ib2 þ mi þ X1ic þ eit
              | where X1i is a row vector of averages with respect to time of the time-dependent
              | explanatory variables (Frees 2001, 2004, see also Arellano 1993). One may interpret
              | this model as a model that speciﬁes the dependency of a on the time-dependent
              | variables as ai ¼ X1ic þ mi. (See also Hsiao 2003). Using GLS estimation in this
              | model results in estimators that are robust to time constant omitted variables bias
              | (Frees 2004). Testing the hypothesis c = 0 is an alternative to the Hausman

              | speciﬁcation test. Furthermore, since we use robust standard errors in the estimation
              | of c, this test is more robust to violation of model assumptions (homoscedasticity
              | and no serial correlation). Clearly, from Table 3 the c-vector can not be assumed to
              | be the zero vector. We further note that the ‘‘within’’ estimate and the ‘‘augmented’’
              | estimate of the vector b1 are equal (Frees 2001, 2004). Some minor discrepancies in
              | Table 3 are due to the estimation routine.
              | Judged from model (4) in Table 3, DISTANCE has a negative effect on VIIT.
              | Thus hypothesis H4 is supported by the data. As regards the effect of ASP and
              | INCO on VIIT, the signs of the coefﬁcients are as expected and also signiﬁcant in
              | these models and thereby offering support for hypothesis H1 and H3. The effect of
              | AGDPC on VIIT is also signiﬁcant and positive. On the one hand, AGDPC interacts
              | signiﬁcantly with our measure of income distribution overlap, INCO. The negative
              | interaction implies that the positive effect on VIIT of a larger income distribution
              | overlap between a country pair levels off when average income of the country pair
              | increases. On the other hand, the positive effect of AGDPC decreases with larger
              | income distribution overlap. In fact, since the regression coefﬁcients for AGDPC
              | and the interaction between INCO and AGDPC are of the same size but of a
              | different sign, a maximum value of INCO (=1) implies no effect of AGDPC. As
              | regards the effects of differences in factor endowments these are positive except the
              | effect of DPKL but not signiﬁcant. The results of models (2) and (4) indicate that
              | differences in factor endowments have a minor inﬂuence on VIIT.
              | In order to further investigate the effects of differences in factor endowments we
              | set up a model allowing for serial correlation (AR (1)) and variable slopes (random
              | coefﬁcients) as regards DTKL and DPKL. The random slopes can be expressed as
              | b ? di with b as the ﬁxed part and di as a random component with mean zero. Thus
              | b is the average slope and di is the difference between the average slope and
              | the slope for country pair i. None of the variance components are signiﬁcant (results
              | not shown). Hence we do not ﬁnd support for hypothesis H2, i.e. the effect of
              | differences in factor endowments on VIIT does not depend on trade partners.
              | Model (5) takes account of serial correlation and reveals practical identical results
              | as model (4).
              | In Table 3, some ﬁt-measures are supplied in order to choose the ‘‘best’’ model
              | for inference. R2 is a pseudo coefﬁcient of determination, calculated as the squared
              | correlation between the dependent variable y and the estimated values of y based on
              | ﬁxed (non-random) effects. Since the country pair level in model (2) is included, the
              | value of R2 is very high but at the expense of many parameters. Without the country
              | pair level the value is 0.026. This shows that the included time-dependent
              | explanatory variables have only a small effect on VIIT. As a ﬁt measure that also
              | takes into account the number of parameters of the ﬁtted model is Baysian
              | information criterion (BIC), calculated as
              | BIC ¼
              | 2 log likelihood þ number of parameters logðN*Þ
              | where N* is the number of subjects or country pairs (=153). A smaller value
              | indicates a better and more parsimonious model. In this sense, model (5) in Table 3
              | is the best model among the relevant models (2), (4) and (5) indicating that
              | inference concerning effects should be performed in model (5).

text          | In order to investigate the robustness of the conclusions to different choices of
              | dispersion factor, results for d = 25% are shown in Table 4. The conclusions
              | regarding the effect of the explanatory variables are the same as with d = 15%.
              | 7 Conclusions
              | Using panel data methods, we conducted an econometric analysis of intra-industry
              | trade with vertically differentiated products among the EU-15 countries and four
              | East European countries: Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic. We
              | investigated the effect of differences in factor endowments and other determinants
              | that emerge from theory: income distribution overlap, average income, share of the
              | total industrial production and geographical proximity.
              | We ﬁnd that differences in factor endowments seem not to be important as a
              | driving force behind VIIT for European countries in the period 1996–2005. More
              | important driving forces are production size, geographical proximity, average
              | income per capita and income distribution overlap. Countries characterized by being
              | on a high economic level and by being large economies have a higher bilateral VIIT
              | with each other than with other countries. Furthermore, countries with large income
              | distribution overlap tend to have a large VIIT. Finally, countries far from each other
              | have lower VIIT than countries close to each other.
