              | Without doubt, the context of responsible management education has changed over
              | the last twelve months. Business schools1 are accused of being partly responsible for
              | the current economic crisis because they have failed to seriously integrate reflections
              | on ethical values into their curricula (Holland 2009; Jacobs 2009). Of course, we could
              | lament more about the status of responsible management education (or rather the lack
              | of much of a status). But why not take this crisis as an opportunity to lead change?
              | Why not look into the future and use this crisis to finally champion responsible man-
              | agement education? While the economic downturn surely has remarkable negative
              | effects on peoples’ lives around the globe, it also creates a lot of promise, not least for
              | the further dissemination and upscaling of responsible management education. The
              | time is ripe for leading change with regard to responsible management education, in
              | Germany and elsewhere. We are living in difficult and promising times, or as Ángel
              | Cabrera (2009), President of Thunderbird School of Global Management, argued
              | recently: “Let’s not waste a good crisis!”
              | The argument which we would like to present here is as follows. When considering
              | the changing context of responsible management education – mostly driven by the
              | recent global economic downturn but also by a more general suspicion that business
              | schools cannot deliver what they promise – we should not waste this opportunity to
              | finally put responsible management education in its rightful place: at the strategic core
              | of the business school curriculum. We propose to consider the Principles for Responsible
              | Management Education (abbreviated PRME, pronounced ‘prime’) as one possible change
              | agent to drive this process. The PRME embody a voluntary set of principles to which
              | business schools can adhere in the interest of providing future leaders with the neces-
              | sary insights and skills to reflect upon, critically analyze, and provide leadership with
              | regard to corporate responsibility.

              | We use the word ‘business school’ throughout our discussion. This, however, should not indicate
              | that our remarks are limited to business schools. In particular, the PRME can also be adopted by
              | entire universities or universities of applied sciences.
              | 2.
              | A ‘Window of Opportunity’ to Champion Responsible Management
              | Education
              | We think there are at least two recent developments which should put responsible
              | management education into the centre of business school’s strategic positioning.
              | From our perspective, both debates create a ‘window of opportunity’ to finally start
              | integrating responsible management education into the curricula and research prac-
              | tices of business schools. We consider these developments to be as much of relevance
              | for German academic institutions as they are for the rest of the world.
              | First, there is the discussion around whether business school education (or rather the
              | lack of it) is to blame for the recent financial crisis. Of course, no one would seriously
              | claim that academic institutions are exclusively responsible for the economic down-
              | turn. However, it cannot be neglected that business schools educated many of those
              | people who contributed to the current crisis in one way or another. Many commenta-
              | tors raise doubts about whether business school education in general and MBA pro-
              | grams in particular adequately prepare students for the ethical challenges they face in
              | their later careers. The Wall Street Journal, for instance, argues that business schools, by
              | failing to systemically and critically discuss issues such as executive incentive pro-
              | grams, have contributed to the financial crisis (Jacobs 2009). Likewise, The New York
              | Times wonders whether “the way business students are taught may have contributed to
              | the most serious economic crisis in decades” (Holland 2009). The bottom line is that
              | we cannot solely neglect that business schools have a responsibility to train their stu-
              | dents in a responsible way. As James Post (2009) remarked recently in the Financial
              | Times, “schools must now reinvent themselves as part of the solution”.
              | Second, there is the argument that business schools’ overemphasis on market mecha-
              | nisms and the importance of companies’ stock prices failed to teach students that they
              | are part of a profession which is responsible for more than shareholder value
              | (Khurana 2007). Management, as Khurana argues, is as much a profession as medicine
              | or law. Business schools, however, never taught their students that they were part of a
              | profession and thus expected to uphold basic ethical values. While it would be naïve
              | to believe that professionalization of the management field would ipso facto make
              | graduates more responsible, it is not unreasonable to suppose that a professionaliza-
              | tion (e.g., expressed through a widely accepted code of conduct) could at least help to
              | change business schools’ culture and foster students’ reflections. In other words, the
              | current crisis has presented us, and the public at large, with the evidence that man-
              | agement carries with its decisions an important (positive or negative) social impact. In
              | that sense, management is a profession that has to do with the common public good.
              | Hence, infusing the sense of responsibility in future leaders and professionals about
              | the social and environmental impact of management decision-making should be con-
              | sidered a central concern in business education from now on.
              | Related to this debate around the professional social risks of management decision-
              | making, some schools are considering the introduction of an oath for managers. Thun-
              | derbird, for instance, introduced a ‘Professional Oath of Honor’ about four years ago.

text          | “The Code has helped change our academic culture by shaping conversations
              | inside and outside the classroom. We are yet to prove empirically whether the
              | initiative will have a meaningful impact on the professional conduct of our
              | graduates, but third party assessments indicate that our students may be more
              | sensitive to the broader set of social responsibilities of managers than the aver-
              | age MBA student.” (Cabrera 2009)
              | Trying to change education through a commitment to a set of aspirational/inspirational
              | principles, like PRME, is as much needed as to give incentives for such a change
              | through an ‘oath’ at the end of the educational period. Obviously, as in the debate
              | some 20 years ago on quality control in the company, a final quality control does not
              | preclude Total Quality Management throughout the entire production process. Thus,
              | it is not only time to rethink what is being taught in business schools, but to also ques-
              | tion the pillars upon which management education was built.
              | The two described developments are particularly interesting for German business
              | schools as there has been a steep increase in MBA programmes over the last couple of
              | years, either to meet rising local demand and/or to better position academic institu-
              | tions in the increasingly competitive global business school landscape. While this de-
              | velopment is certainly appreciable, there is also a risk that German business schools
              | will more or less ‘blindly’ follow the traditional North American MBA model (with its
              | overemphasis on teaching students how to handle hard data and come up with quick
              | solutions; Mintzberg 2005). Considering the abovementioned ‘window of opportunity’
              | to champion and upscale responsible management education, German business
              | schools should not waste this crisis to finally come to grips with integrating corporate
              | responsibility issues into the curriculum. We believe that joining the global PRME
              | network can support German business schools in building up capacity with regard to
              | responsible management education, learning from the achievements and failures of
              | other academic institutions, and thus being able to lead the change (instead of follow-
              | ing it). Hence, the PRME should be perceived as one possible, yet by no means the
              | only, way to building up a strategic approach towards responsible management educa-
              | tion which clearly reaches beyond isolated courses on ‘business ethics’.
              | 3.
              | One Answer – The PRME
              | The PRME reflect a change agent for responsible management education; a change
              | agent which relies on the voluntary commitment of participating academic institu-
              | tions. Similar to the United Nations Global Compact, the PRME are not a certification
              | standard to ensure that a business school has complied with certain principles (Rasche
              | 2009). Much like the Global Compact, the PRME, at the macro-level, provide a plat-
              | form where interested institutions can exchange ideas and best practices, while, at the
              | micro-level, they are supposed to stimulate and guide a school’s development of re-
              | sponsible management education. The following six principles act as a ‘walking stick’
              | assisting those institutions which are willing to promote and champion responsible
              | management education:
              | (1)
              | (2)
              | (3)
              | (4)
              | (5)
              | (6)
              | We will develop the capabilities of students to be future generators of sustain-
              | able value for business and society at large and to work for an inclusive and sus-
              | tainable global economy.
              | We will incorporate into our academic activities and curricula the values of
              | global social responsibility as portrayed in international initiatives such as the
              | United Nations Global Compact.
              | We will create educational frameworks, materials, processes and environments
              | that enable effective learning experiences for responsible leadership.
              | We will engage in conceptual and empirical research that advances our under-
              | standing about the role, dynamics, and impact of corporations in the creation
              | of sustainable social, environmental and economic value.
              | We will interact with managers of business corporations to extend our knowl-
              | edge of their challenges in meeting social and environmental responsibilities
              | and to explore jointly effective approaches towards meeting these challenges.
              | We will facilitate and support dialogue and debate among educators, business,
              | government, consumers, media, civil society organizations and other interested
              | groups and stakeholders on critical issues related to global responsibility and
              | sustainability.
              | At first glance the six principles may look very general. However, it is essential to con-
              | sider that there is a certain necessary contextual ‘emptiness’ when developing and im-
              | plementing global principles because the contexts that business schools operate in may
              | differ considerably (e.g., when looking at differences in legal systems and/or existing
              | norms and values regarding education). Each participating institution needs to reflect
              | upon (and thus show commitment to) what the six principles mean in practice. For
              | example, the third principle regarding educational frameworks and learning materials
              | can be implemented through quite different actions depending on factors such as class
              | size and available resources (e.g., money to purchase case studies). At the same time, a
              | whole new approach, experiential learning is being opened up in the context of
              | PRME, and that debate will only progress through a process of exchange of best prac-
              | tices by leading PRME signatories. The point is to not believe that the six principles
              | will tell educational institutions what to do, but to acknowledge that schools need to
              | ‘fill’ these six principles with contextualized and innovative meaning based on reflec-
              | tions and peer discussions.
              | Participating institutions are expected to enter into a process of continuous improve-
              | ment taking the six principles as a guiding idea about where to start and what to do.
              | To inspire and foster mutual learning among institutions, the PRME require an annual
              | reporting on progress. Reports are supposed to stimulate discussions, enable learning,
              | disseminate ideas and allow participating institutions to set the agenda for responsible
              | management education, both within organizations and in the wider socio-economic
              | environment. It should also be pointed out that the PRME are not a membership ini-
              | tiative (i.e. an initiative which charges a membership fee in order to join the network).
              | A key strength of principle-based initiatives, such as the Global Compact or the PRME,
              | is that they allow for experimentation and innovation on the side of participants. As
              | innovation cannot be regulated but evolves out of the commitment of participants,

text          | business schools should view the PRME as a step to finding and sharing new solu-
              | tions and ideas towards responsible management education (Waddock et al. 2009).
              | The PRME grew in part because business leaders, who have committed themselves to
              | the ten principles of the Global Compact, were asking educational institutions: What
              | are you doing to help future business leaders to understand the challenges of responsible management?
              | Any serious and long-term consideration of responsible management needs to include
              | educational institutions as important players, particularly when reflecting upon the
              | lessons we have learned from the recent financial crisis. Educational institutions not
              | only provide factual knowledge about responsible business practices, but also (and
              | maybe most importantly) have the ability to encourage students’ reflection about their
              | values. Considering this role of higher educational institutions, the PRME were devel-
              | oped between October 2006 and July 2007 by an international task force of 60 Deans,
              | University Presidents, as well as scholars committed to the idea of responsible man-
              | agement education. To enhance the multi-stakeholder nature and perceived legitimacy
              | of the development process, the drafting of the principles was supported by represen-
              | tatives from the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the Association to Ad-
              | vance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the Aspen Institute’s Business and
              | Society Program, the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD),
              | the Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative (GRLI), Net Impact, a student organi-
              | zation with more than 13,000 members, the Graduate Management Admission Coun-
              | cil (GMAC), and the European Academy of Business in Society (EABIS). All of these
              | institutions remain partners of the initiative as they are members of the steering com-
              | mittee which guides the PRME.
              | In July 2007, the outcome of this development process was presented to UN Secre-
              | tary-General Ban Ki-moon at the triennial Global Compact Leaders Summit in Geneva.
              | During its first two years of existence, the initiative witnessed a tremendous growth in
              | terms of participating institutions (from around 40 in July 2007 to more than 270 in
              | November 2009). The enormous interest in the PRME and its underlying idea was
              | also reflected by the high participation rate in the first Global Forum for Responsible Man-
              | agement Education held at UN headquarters in December 2008.
              | 4.
              | The PRME in Germany – The Benefits of Participation
              | Whereas the initiative is currently approaching 270 signatories from all five continents,
              | only twelve participating institutions are located in Germany. Hence, the PRME –
              | although a global success story to date – have not made it onto the agenda of most
              | German business schools. We could speculate about possible reasons for this reserva-
              | tion to join the initiative (e.g., ranging from the historically weak position of ‘business
              | ethics education’ in German universities to concerns about the Principles being per-
              | ceived as constraining the traditionally important freedom of teaching and research
              | within universities). Instead of speculating about possible constraints, we would like to
              | highlight selected reasons for signing up to the initiative hoping to convince decision
              | makers to think of the PRME as a change agent for their institutions.
              | First, any institution which joins the PRME enjoys the benefits of being a recognized
              | leader with regard to responsible management education. The recent ‘credit crunch’
              | has shown that an adaptation process within the global economy is inevitable. This
              | forecasts a ‘race to the top’ where the landscape of leading institutions will be re-
              | shaped, and where the leaders of the not too distant tomorrow will be those business
              | schools who trigger a process of innovation and adaptation to the new environment,
              | placing at the center of their educational activities the core values and concepts of
              | sustainability and corporate social responsibility. This process will put corporate re-
              | sponsibility center stage and thus create more demand for ethics courses throughout
              | the curriculum from students and potential employers alike. According to Blaine
              | (2009), most schools have already witnessed a steep increase in ethics-related courses
              | which has put responsible management education in its rightful place. The PRME can
              | support and foster this process and help German academic institutions to be per-
              | ceived as leaders in the field of responsible management education.
              | Second, the PRME can act as an internal change agent when trying to advance the
              | curriculum in favour of a transversal updating of all disciplines, from finance to mar-
              | keting, operations, human resources management or strategic management. As the
              | principles need to be signed by the highest-ranking executive of a business school, it is
              | reasonable to expect that ‘after the signature’ there should be some top-level support
              | for pushing ethical issues into the curriculum. Considering the many micro-political
              | struggles within business schools (e.g., between different departments), support and
              | effective leadership from a high-ranking executive (e.g., the Dean) can help to over-
              | come ideological barriers to create interest and acceptance for ethical issues within the
              | faculty. This is not to say that the PRME need to be exclusively implemented in a top-
              | down mode. Rather, the backing by high-ranking decision makers should support
              | grassroots ideas coming from different parts of the faculty. Our findings, out of the
              | experience gathered throughout the PRME community, clearly suggest that both a
              | top-down approach and a bottom-up approach are necessary to make progress along
              | the lines of PRME.
              | Third, joining the PRME gives access to a strong network of likeminded institutions.
              | The 1st Global Forum for Responsible Management Education, which was held in New York
              | City in December 2008, demonstrated that committed schools have a lot to share and
              | that access to this network can give a school a competitive edge in times where the
              | business school landscape is becoming evermore competitive. Building capacity and
              | being a leader in terms of responsible management education is increasingly rewarded
              | through rankings such as the Aspen Institute’s Beyond Grey Pinstripes list and Net Im-
              | pact’s Business as UNusual guide. Considering that German institutions are currently
              | not listed in both rankings, the PRME should be perceived as a change agent to posi-
              | tion an institution’s efforts with regard to responsible management education in the
              | global business school landscape. This process of ‘catching up’ also creates the oppor-
              | tunity to learn from best practices which other business schools have developed.
              | To conclude, we think there is a lot of promise when considering the current status of
