              | Abstract
              | This paper addresses the question of what role morally oriented behavior plays in the
              | efficiency of market outcomes. This issue is as controversial in economics as it is in
              | sociology. To get a better understanding of the problems and opportunities involved
              | in morally oriented behavior in markets, I develop a typology that distinguishes four
              | different forms of morality-based behavior and try to understand what consequences
              | derive from these types of morally motivated action. The four forms I discuss I
              | call “cooperation,” “group solidarity,” “blocked exchange” and “altruism.” There is a
              | fifth – parasitic – type that I call “Trojan altruism.” I argue that the contested role of
              | morality is rooted in the profoundly ambivalent consequences that morality has on
              | market efficiency.
              | Zusammenfassung
              | In diesem Discussion Paper betrachte ich die Auswirkungen moralisch orientierten
              | Handelns auf die Effizienz von Märkten. Diese Frage ist sowohl unter Soziologen als
              | auch unter Ökonomen stark umstritten. Um zu einem besseren Verständnis der Pro-
              | bleme und Chancen zu gelangen, die sich aus moralischen Handlungsorientierungen
              | für Marktbeziehungen ergeben, entwickele ich eine Typologie, mit der vier verschie-
              | dene Formen moralgestützten Handelns unterschieden werden. Die vier Formen
              | nenne ich „Kooperation“, „Gruppensolidarität“, „blockierter Tausch“ und „Altruis-
              | mus“. Darüber hinaus besteht ein fünfter, parasitärer Typus, den ich als „Trojani-
              | schen Altruismus“ bezeichne. Ich zeige, dass die umstrittene Rolle von Moralität für
              | Märkte ihren Hintergrund in den tatsächlich zutiefst ambivalenten Folgen von Mora-
              | lität für die Effizienz von Märkten hat.

text          | Introduction
              | What role does morality play for market outcomes? For most sociologists the func-
              | tioning of markets is closely connected to the moral conduct of economic actors. This
              | position is expressed, for instance, by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1984)
              | who argued that purely self-interested behavior cannot produce stable exchange rela-
              | tions. Only through the “non contractual conditions of contract” do actors feel effec-
              | tively bound to the contractual obligations they have agreed to. The moral code stops
              | actors from exploiting their exchange partners through opportunistic behavior. This
              | way morality supports the functioning of markets by reducing transaction costs. An-
              | other sociological classic, Max Weber (1984), made morality a cornerstone in his ex-
              | planation of macroeconomic development: For him the emergence of modern west-
              | ern capitalism had an indispensable basis in the moral doctrines of Protestantism.
              | Wolfgang Streeck (1997: 198) followed this idea by introducing the notion of “benefi-
              | cial constraints,” meaning that the performance of an economy “may be improved by
              | the surrounding society retaining and exercising a right for itself to interfere with the
              | choice and pursuit of individual preferences.”
              | However, the conviction that markets need a moral basis has not gone undisputed in
              | sociology (Luhmann 1986, 1988). But more than sociologists, economists have chal-
              | lenged this position. Most famously the model of the “invisible hand” expresses the
              | connection of public virtue to private vices and thereby disconnects market outcomes
              | from morally motivated action.
              | It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our din-
              | ner but from their regard to their self-interest. (Smith 1976: 18)1
              | A famous contemporary expression of the unwanted consequences of morally moti-
              | vated behavior in markets is Milton Friedman’s (1973) dictum that “the social re-
              | sponsibility of business is to make profits.” According to Friedman, any deviation
              | from profit maximization is itself morally problematic since the moral task of eco-
              | nomic actors is to maximize economic welfare.
              | While economists standing in the neo-classical tradition see moral action orientations
              | as blocking economically efficient outcomes, economists from other theoretical tradi-
              | tions presume that the logic of self-interest must be moderated by morality in order to
              | allow for the “common good” or even for the functioning of markets itself. The insti-
              | tutionalist tradition, and also the new microeconomics, see norms, values and trust as

text          | This reading of Adam Smith reflects the interpretation of his work by proponents of the neo-
              | classical tradition in economics. Smith scholars have argued pervasively that this is a flawed
              | interpretation of the Scottish enlightenment philosopher (Wight: 2002). The purpose here,
              | however, is to present an analytical position that plays an important role in economic think-
              | ing.

              | indispensable elements of the functioning of markets (Arrow 1973). There are situa-
              | tions where selfishness should be held back by moral principles to achieve superior
              | outcomes. The reason is that markets themselves are “morally unreliable” (Offe 1989).
              | Morality is certainly not the only mechanism by which market failure can be cor-
              | rected. Morality does play, however, an important role for overcoming free-riding and
              | for solving principal-agent problems.
              | These brief remarks give an impression on the essentially contested role of morality
              | for market outcomes. The conflict is not one that separates academic disciplines; it
              | runs through disciplinary lines. My intention in this paper is to critically examine
              | these positions: Does morality hinder economic efficiency or is morality a necessary
              | condition for markets to operate? Which problems exactly can be resolved through
              | morally motivated behavior? And which limitations to economic efficiency are caused
              | by morality?2
              | The question of the effects of morality on markets is not only of academic interest. It
              | is also from the background of recent corporate scandals that morality in business –
              | or the lack thereof – has become a pressing issue in public debate. Have corporate
              | managers become more selfish? What institutional or moral safeguards are needed to
              | prevent the excesses that brought companies like Enron and Worldcom to bank-
              | ruptcy?
              | What I will argue in this paper is that the contested role of morality has its causes in
              | the indeed profoundly ambivalent consequences that morality has on market out-
              | comes. Morality allows for the emergence and stabilization of market exchange, but it
              | is also an action orientation that can block exchange relations that are economically
              | beneficial. I intend to contribute to a better understanding of this ambivalence by
              | introducing a taxonomy that distinguishes four different forms of morality-based

text          | In focusing on the economic effects of morality on market outcomes, I will not deal with three
              | other questions related to morality in the economy. First, I will not discuss the question of the
              | consequences for economic theory that derive from the inclusion of morality. Amartya Sen
              | (1977), among others, has shown that morally motivated behavior demands profound
              | changes of neoclassic economic models since it involves “in a very real sense, counterpreferen-
              | tial choice, destroying the crucial assumption that a chosen alternative must be better than (or
              | at least as good as) the others for the person choosing it” (Sen 1977: 33). The notion of meta-
              | preferences is one well known suggestion to include morality into economic theory (Sen 1977;
              | Hirschman 1986; Etzioni 1988). Secondly, I will deal only marginally with the question of
              | non-economic justifications for “moral systems of exchange” (Biggart / Delbridge 2004). Eco-
              | nomic efficiency cannot provide by itself justification for certain behaviors or institutional
              | regulations. To submerge normative questions under the logic of efficiency would be a cate-
              | gorical mistake. A third question connected to the issue of morality and markets that is not
              | dealt with here refers to the relationship of morality and institutions. What institutional sup-
              | port do actors need in order to make it more likely that they will actually act in accordance
              | with the moral convictions they hold (Hirschman 1986; Offe 1989)?

text          | behavior and try to understand what consequences derive from these types of morally
              | motivated action. The four forms I will discuss I call “cooperation,” “group solidar-
              | ity,” “blocked exchange” and “altruism.” There is a fifth – parasitic – type that I will
              | call “Trojan altruism.”
              | By morality I mean that actors act in accordance with some principle which is ori-
              | ented (also) toward the well-being of others or the common good and is followed
              | even if it demands to forgo additional personal profit or utility. Amartya Sen (1977)
              | has called this action orientation “commitment.” With reference to the terminology
              | introduced by Robert Frank (1990), one can formulate: to act morally, an actor must
              | be willing to engage in “irrational behavior without regret.” “Irrational behavior” re-
              | fers to decisions that deviate from individual utility maximization. The “lack of re-
              | gret” implies that the behavior was chosen not simply by miscalculation of outcomes
              | but by a deliberate choice.
              | My argument is not that the observation of inefficiencies due to moral orientations of
              | actors gives justifications to change these expressions of value rationality. Instead the
              | argument is that economies operate within the context of a moral universe that resists
              | the logic of economic efficiency and that at times this resistance is itself a precondition
              | for market exchange, while at others it produces inefficiencies.
              | A typology of moral behavior in market exchange
              | Morality can enter into market exchange in four different forms. It can enter by taking
              | one’s own well-being and the well-being of others into consideration. This I will call
              | “cooperation.” An important special case of cooperation will be discussed under the
              | heading of “group solidarity.” The third typological form in which morality can enter
              | into market exchange is by an action orientation that is entirely non-consequentialist,
              | i.e. which disregards the welfare effects for ego and alter-ego. This comes closest to
              | Weber’s (1985) notion of value rationality. I will refer to this as “blocked exchange”
              | (Walzer 1983). Morality can also enter the decision-making process in the typological
              | form of ignoring consequences for one’s own well-being but having the well-being of
              | others in mind. This I will call “altruism.” Finally, the last form is a parasitic way for
              | morality to enter a decision-making situation. It indicates an action that appears to be
              | beneficial to others but is in fact primarily advantageous to the actor himself. This
              | behavior, which is actually immoral, I will call “Trojan altruism.”

text          | Cooperation
              | By cooperation I refer to a set of reciprocal promises and expectations that guide ex-
              | change relationships in a mutually beneficial way. Such promises and expectations can
              | become effective through an intersubjectively shared moral code that binds the behav-
              | ior of the parties to the exchange. Based on this moral code, market participants will
              | fulfill their contractual obligations even if it would be advantageous for them not to
              | do so. They will also disclose relevant information accurately.3 Morality in “coopera-
              | tion” can contribute to the solution of prisoner-dilemma situations and principal-
              | agent problems.4 In the prisoner dilemma, all players will achieve a superior outcome
              | if they cooperate. Effective ethical codes can help to induce cooperative behavior and
              | thereby contribute to resolve endemic free-rider problems (Arrow 1973; Beckert
              | 2002a). The significance of morality in principal-agent situations is no less important.
              | It has already been described by Max Weber (1984) in his treatment of the role of
              | Protestant sects in American business life. Weber observed that sect members are
              | trusted in business relations disembedded from the local community due to an effec-
              | tive ethical code that will bind the behavior of the sect member even when conducting
              | business with complete strangers. Hence the ethical code allows actors to engage in
              | An increasingly relevant counter-example is fake medication. Particularly in Third World
              | countries, patients are increasingly confronted with bogus medications that either contain no
              | active ingredients or even include substances that are poisonous. Pharmaceutical companies
              | are not only worried about this tendency because it effects their business through a loss in
              | short term sales, but also because it can lead to market failure due to a loss in customer confi-
              | dence in the effectiveness of medications.
              | Granovetter (1985) has made an important point that the effectiveness of behavioral norms
              | depends not only on value convictions, but especially on the concrete structures of social rela-
              | tions.

              | outcomes – morality has almost exclusively positive effects. If the logic described by
              | George Akerlof (1970) for the used car market holds true, then not only the principal
              | (the buyer of the car) is better off if he or she can rely on the accuracy and complete-
              | ness of the information revealed, but also the agent himself is better off. Otherwise the
              | market would fail to come into existence or more costly monitoring devices would
              | need to be introduced. The same holds true for labor relations where a lack of any
              | other motives besides personal gain will have negative effects for productivity (Akerlof
              | 1984). A similar argument can be made with regard to professional ethics that are a
              | coordinating force in the exchange relations between laypeople and expert systems.5
              | Group solidarity
              | A closely related type of morally guided behavior affecting markets is “group solidar-
              | ity.” It is based on the pooling of resources. Group solidarity differs from “coopera-
              | tion” by drawing a boundary between those actors covered by the moral obligations
              | and those not covered by these obligations. Through this boundary of exclusion – or
              | network closure (Coleman 1990) – group solidarity achieves an ambivalent status as
              | the moral principles are only coordinating behavior within the group. Behavior can be
              | non-moralistic, purely self-interested with regard to the consequences of decisions for
              | outsiders. Solidarity is a non-universalistic ethic (Bayertz 1998).
              | Looking at social relations within the group, “group solidarity” has characteristics
              | similar to “cooperation.” It is a mechanism for improvement of one’s own situation
              | and that of other group members by overcoming free-riding. Solving free-rider prob-
              | lems is a precondition for the effective pooling of resources. In modern capitalist
meta          | 5
text          | The only ambiguity arising in the prisoner dilemma and in principal-agent situations is with
              | regard to the trust-taker or agent. Particularly when the behavior of the agent cannot be com-
              | pletely observed by the principals, it might be a more profitable strategy for him or her to al-
              | ternate between moral (cooperation) and immoral (defection) strategies. Such mixed strate-
              | gies do not necessarily lead to market failure, in part, because the exchange partner does not
              | have the information to know which strategy the agent actually follows. As experimental stud-
              | ies in game theory show, there are other strategies besides unconditional cooperation that
              | have superior pay-offs for the trust-taker (agent) compared to unconditional cooperation. For
              | the agent it may be sufficient to act partially morally to earn the full benefits of morality. Ho-

              | economies the union movement is probably the most relevant empirical form of
              | group solidarity. Unions enhance the workers’ power positions in the industrial con-
              | flict by credibly threatening to withdraw a significant amount of labor from the pro-
              | duction process that cannot be substituted for in the short run. Unions do have the
              | instrumental goals of negotiating better wage settlements, working conditions or
              | greater job security. However, as Claus Offe and Helmut Wiesenthal (1985) have
              | shown, membership mobilization by unions cannot rely exclusively on rational in-
              | strumental motivations, but it must also appeal to a moral obligation to participate,
              | even if unions want to serve nothing “but the member’s individual utilitarian inter-
              | ests” (Offe / Wiesenthal 1985: 183).
              | Commitment-based behavior leading to the pooling of resources can have positive
              | consequences for the instrumental goals of the group members. Its role in market effi-
              | ciency, however, is highly contested. From a market-liberal perspective union solidar-
              | ity amounts to a cartel that increases prices for labor and thereby leads to inefficient
              | equilibria. Based on this claim, unions are seen as being responsible for unemploy-
              | ment. This argument, however, does not go unchallenged. According to institutional-
              | ist approaches in economics (and sociology), unions do play a constructive role in
              | markets and general economic welfare by helping to institutionalize industrial con-
              | flict, forcing companies to invest into their competitiveness and increasing consumer
              | purchasing power (e.g. Streeck / Schmitter 1985).
              | The positive role of group solidarity has also been demonstrated in research on ethnic
              | economies (Portes / Sensenbrenner 1993). Here network closure can help overcome
              | market failures that arise through discrimination. This can be exemplified by ethnic
              | economies in the U.S. In order to be able to start a company, some immigrant groups,
              | who do not have access to American capital markets, come together in rotating credit
              | associations, pooling their assets and using them in turn to finance their individual
              | businesses. This makes it possible to create firms, which otherwise would not have
              | been established. Though these associations rely on intense reciprocal monitoring of
              | its members, they are also based on the moral implications of belonging to the same
              | ethnic group.6 At the same time, non-members of the ethnic group are excluded from
              | the benefits and thereby discriminated against through ascriptive criteria. This shows
              | the purely self-interested side of group solidarity with regard to non-members.
              | Community or family based network closure is, however, by no means unequivocally
              | positive for the economic well-being of the members of the solidaristic community. If
              | moral codes demand that economically successful family (or community) members
              | support less successful members by transferring resources, these resources are not
              | available for individual business investments. As observed by anthropologists, this can
              | inhibit economic development and gives rise to avoidance strategies by which success-

text          | ful entrepreneurs try to circumvent family obligations. One interesting strategy has
              | been observed in indigenous villages in Ecuador. Male owners of garment and leather
              | artisan shops convert to Protestantism. By doing so the entrepreneurs “remove them-
              | selves from the host of social obligations for male family heads associated with the
              | Catholic Church and its local organization” (Portes / Sensenbrenner 1993: 1339). In
              | more general terms, this supports Max Weber’s claim that one of the chief causes for
              | the success of modern Western capitalism was that Protestantism guided economic
              | exchange away from the close connectedness of economic affairs to social obligations.
              | Weber (1986) alluded also to a further problematic consequence of distinguishing
              | between a morality within the group and an external morality that is characterized by
              | pure utilitarianism. He found this type of particularism in societies adhering to Con-
              | fucianism and saw in it the reason for general mistrust becoming a dominant feature
              | in all business relations reaching beyond the group’s boundaries. Not morality as such
              | but a morality that is only valid for the family and the clan was a factor that prevented
              | the development of extensive exchange relations.
              | Blocked exchange
              | The third type of morally guided behavior in markets I will call – using a term intro-
              | duced by Michael Walzer (1983) – “blocked exchange.” Blocked exchange refers to
              | the prohibition or restriction of the monetary exchange of certain objects or services
              | based on moral codes. It is the opposite of cooperation where the function of morality
              | is to enable market transactions. Blocked exchanges prevent the market exchange of
              | certain goods and services by keeping them outside the market realm.7
              | Which transactions are blocked changes historically and differs between societies.
              | Therefore it is not possible to make a finite list of goods and services to which ex-
              | change restrictions apply. Two economically crucial fields where such changes have
              | occurred are the limitations of charging interest for lending money and the abolition
              | of slavery. Cultural differences can be seen in religiously motivated taboos on the con-
              | sumption of certain food products like pork.
              | Despite historical and social variance it is possible to list categories of goods that are
              | likely to be restricted from monetary exchange in modern societies. One category are
              | exchanges that affect the human body. It is prohibited to buy another person (slavery
meta          | 7
text          | Societies may succeed only incompletely in the enforcement of such blockages. This does not,
              | however, invalidate the claim that certain exchanges are morally rejected and that subsequent
              | restrictions do have effects on the way these goods and services are exchanged.

              | and adoption).8 The commercial sale of body parts for medical reasons is mostly for-
              | bidden (organ markets); in many countries women are prohibited from carrying a
              | child to term for another, infertile woman (reproductive medicine); and the sale of
              | sexual services is restricted and even prohibited in many countries (prostitution). A
              | second realm is the market exchange of political influence and offices. The purchase
              | of political decisions is called corruption and as such illegal. The third realm are legal
              | claims and obligations that cannot be purchased or sold. There is no market for trad-
              | ing criminal punishment. The rights to vote, to freedom of expression or to freely
              | exercise one’s religious beliefs are all non-marketable.9
              | In general terms, blocked exchanges are characterized by the separation of the goods
              | or services that are connected to “sacred” (Durkheim) social values from the “pro-
              | fane” sphere of the market. It is not instrumental rationality that motivates exchange
              | blockages but rather value rationality (Weber), i.e., the belief in the value of an action
              | independent of its consequences for oneself or for others. As Durkheim has argued,
              | the act of establishing such taboos is an important aspect of the identity of a social
              | group. This implies that blocked exchanges cannot be explained by their contribution
              | to economic efficiency. The idea that political decisions and human beings cannot be
              | bought might have positive economic consequences. Nevertheless, the justification for
              | prohibiting corruption or abolishing slavery is not based on an economic rationale
              | but rooted in social values which discredit corruption and slavery on moral grounds.
              | Even if norms cannot be explained functionally, it is possible to ask for economic con-
              | sequences of restrictions on specific exchanges since they do not have merely moral
              | relevance, but have functional consequences for the economic system as well. Accord-
              | ing to Max Weber’s theory of rationalization the (originally religiously motivated)
              | decoupling of exchange from moral obligations was one of the crucial preconditions
              | for the development of a modern, functionally differentiated economy. The dissolu-
              | tion of religious restrictions on money lending, the decoupling of exchange from par-
              | ticularistic privileges and the development of modern labor markets were among the
              | most important developments in this process. A case for positive economic effects
              | stimulated by the decoupling of economic exchange from moral restrictions has been
              | analyzed by Viviana Zelizer (1979) in her research on the development of the life in-
              | surance industry in nineteenth-century America. This industry was originally blocked
              | by moral objections, primarily expressed by women, who refused to receive a “pre-
              | mium” for their husband’s death. For many years this moral conviction blocked the
              | development of an effective financial instrument for the economic protection of wid-
              | ows.

meta          | 13
text          | It is not possible here to show the consequences of blocked exchanges in detail. This
              | would demand a close discussion of each morally motivated restriction on market
              | exchange. What I want to illustrate briefly, however, is that the economic effects of
              | blocked exchanges show profound ambivalences with regard to individual welfare and
              | macroeconomic efficiency. While the aforementioned examples point to negative
              | economic consequences, examples for positive economic effects from restrictions of
              | market exchange come easily to mind. Such effects can be attributed to the blockage
              | of the purchasing of political decisions, as can be seen from the examples in corrup-
              | tion-ridden countries. Also, the restrictions on the use of labor power – for instance
              | the prohibition of child labor – have positive economic implications regarding the
              | future productivity of children.
              | One complication with regard to welfare effects derives from the following paradoxi-
              | cal effect that has been observed in the market for blood (Titmuss 1971). The blood
              | market – and possibly other markets for goods taken from the human body as well –
              | has an untypical supply curve. The introduction of an exchange market for blood does
              | not leave the supply of voluntary blood donations unaffected; where blood supply
              | becomes a commercial activity, donors feel less responsibility to continue donating it.
              | Hence, monetary compensation leads to a reduction in voluntary supply. This result,
              | which contradicts economic reasoning, cites economic reasons for organizing blood
              | donations as a gift.
              | Finally, the prohibition of markets for moral reasons might have unintended side ef-
              | fects that must be examined. One important aspect is that the prevention of markets
              | gives way to the emergence of illegal markets that have consequences usually seen as
              | socially and individually negative. Such markets emerge when not all actors submit to
              | the morally demanded behavior. This can be observed not only in the case of (illegal)
              | markets for organs. The prohibition of prostitution undermines the protection of
              | illegal sex industry workers and makes them especially vulnerable; the prohibition of
              | certain narcotics leads to the emergence of drug dealers, crime and serious problems
              | for public health. Through these effects, the morally motivated prohibition of markets
              | shows profound moral and economic dilemmas.
              | Altruism
              | The fourth type of morally motivated behavior relevant for markets is “altruism.”
              | Altruism is defined by a voluntary self-commitment to behavior based on value that
              | inflicts costs on oneself for the benefit of others. Altruism has several forms. The most
              | economically significant one is the voluntary inclusion of otherwise externalized costs.
              | This is the core arena of business ethics, fair trade and socially conscientious con-
              | sumer choices. If companies voluntarily abstain from hiring child labor, pay living
              | wages and protect the natural environment in which they operate their plants, they
meta          | 14

              | increase their costs (i.e., their shareholder’s or customer’s costs) for the benefit of
              | stakeholders like their employees and neighborhood communities. By now, voluntary
              | codes of conduct have led to the establishment of an international standard on social
              | accountability (SA 8000). Some large retailers purchase only from manufacturers that
              | comply with the SA 8000 standard (Biggart / Delbridge 2004). This can be seen as an
              | indicator for an increasing “moralization of markets.”
              | It is, however, debatable to what extent compliance with standards of social or envi-
              | ronmental accountability does indeed reflect altruism. Companies might simply at-
              | tempt to avoid conflicts with important stakeholders by complying with social ac-
              | countability standards or create an image as socially conscientious businesses as an
              | effective argument in their marketing strategies. If profit strategies motivate the com-
              | pliance of companies to standards of social and environmental accountability, their
              | behavior is not covered by the notion of altruism. While the significance of altruism
              | in business behavior is ultimately an empirical question, two theoretical points can be
              | made. First, the market mechanism limits the possibility of altruistic choices that can-
              | not be turned into increased revenues. Managers in a market economy are structurally
              | forced to orient their decisions towards profit making. Any other behavior will lead to
              | a loss in profits and a reduction in market share. Second, the role of the market
              | mechanism does not imply that decisions are determined by the market. Most organi-
              | zations do have significant slack that allows for inefficient decisions without jeopard-
              | izing the survival of the company. Moreover, if one assumes that, under conditions of
              | complexity and fundamental uncertainty of outcomes, managers cannot identify op-
              | timal strategies, the perspective of market determination of business decisions is
              | flawed. Under such conditions managers will base their decisions on culturally legiti-
              | mated conceptualizations of rationality. This constitutive role of culture allows for the
              | introduction of ethically motivated decisions into firm behavior despite market pres-
              | sures towards efficiency (Beckert 2002b).
              | Regardless of whether it reflects genuine altruism or not, the addition of moral con-
              | siderations into the market does change the way business is conducted. Pressure to
              | find ethically reflective strategies develops mostly as a result of investor and consumer
              | choices. Investment fund managers might invest only in companies that have progres-
              | sive policies towards gays and lesbians or that comply with standards of social ac-
              | countability. An interesting example is also the rising field of Islamic banking. Here
              | investments are only made to companies that comply with “Islamic values” (Biggart/
              | Delbridge 2004: 39). This is a form of altruism on the investor’s side if the investor
              | must assume that his investment will have a lower return because he or she forgoes
              | more lucrative alternative investment opportunities. Consumers show altruistic action
              | orientations, for instance, by buying more expensive goods from a neighborhood
              | store, instead of purchasing from Wal-Mart, because they believe in the value of hav-
              | Beckert: The Moral Embeddedness of Markets
meta          | 15
text          | ing neighborhood stores. Consumer boycotts on the other hand express condemna-
              | tion of certain business practices by consumers. Consumers are willing to avoid a
              | product or store in order to support practices that comply with their values.10
              | But what are the economic consequences of such altruistic, value directed allocations
              | of capital and consumer purchasing power? They are costly for the investor or the
              | consumer in monetary terms. One pays a higher price for bread in the local grocery
              | store compared to purchasing it from Wal-Mart. One does without apples from South
              | Africa if they are produced under Apartheid conditions, even if they are a better eco-
              | nomic value. One invests in certain mutual funds even though one expects a lower
              | rate of return compared to alternative investment opportunities. These are counter-
              | preferential choices if one assumes selfishness is the standard for economic choices.11
              | The story becomes more complicated once attention is shifted to the producing firms,
              | countries and traders that are subject to the value based consumer and investor
              | choices. A shift in allocation of investment capital and consumer purchasing power
              | due to altruistic decision-making is beneficial only to those companies, industries or
              | countries that are favored by the social values. It is economically detrimental to those
              | parties which are negatively discriminated against. Looking at macroeconomic conse-
              | quences, the loading of economic exchange relations with value orientations that are
              | followed through altruistic decisions may be problematic as well. They might lead to a
              | particularization of exchange which undermines competition. It contradicts the func-
              | tional differentiation of the economy, i.e., its detachment from substantial value con-
              | victions that makes economic exchange non-discriminatory and inclusive. If decisions
              | are based on altruism, capital is not allocated exclusively under criteria of economic
              | efficiency. Moreover, any judgment of altruism must consider that, given the complex
              | interrelations within the economy, effects may be highly unspecific and contaminated
              | by unintended consequences that may outweigh their positive intentions (Luhmann
              | 1993: 136). Boycotts may also hurt those actors whose interests shall be protected.12

              | qualifies as altruism. Though its declared intention is the principle-based increase of the wel-
              | fare of others, this does not exclude the maximization of one’s own utility. This is the case if
              | the well-being of alter ego forms part of the utility function of ego. This assumes, however,
              | contrary to standard economic models, that utility functions are not independent. Following
              | Amartya Sen (1977), such choices can nevertheless be characterized as moral behavior as long
              | as the personal utility is not the reason for them.
              | 11 These value-oriented allocations of money can be integrated into an economic decision-

              | 12 Boycotts are morally ambivalent. They might be seen as positive by society if values are ex-
              | pressed that find widespread acceptance. The act of boycotting products from South Africa
              | during the Apartheid regime found broad social support. But what if investment is directed to
              | companies upon the condition that they avoid hiring foreigners or Jews? What about boycott-

              | MPIfG Discussion Paper 05 / 6
              | A further way in which “morality” can enter markets I want to call “Trojan altruism.”
              | This is not a type of moral behavior, but refers to the strategic use of substantial value
              | orientations for one’s own benefit and at the cost of others. Trojan altruism is deceit-
              | ful. There are several examples that stand at least under suspicion to form cases of
              | Trojan altruism. The first one is food aid to Third World countries. Food aid increases
              | supply in local markets, causes the depreciation of prices and thereby drives local pro-
              | ducers out of the market. It can also contribute to a change in demand by influencing
              | the taste of consumers and thereby decrease demand for local crops. The dependency
              | created through the destruction of local agricultural production is at the same time
              | beneficial to food exporting countries in the developed world.
              | The suspicion of Trojan altruism also plays a role in current political discourse about
              | standards of social and environmental accountability in global production systems.
              | Codes of social accountability are increasingly honored in business transactions with
              | Third World suppliers. Prison labor, child labor, sweatshop working conditions and
              | pollution of the environment are prime issues. The definition of the codes of conduct
              | takes place mostly in the North. This opens the possibility that the enforcement of a
              | seemingly morality based standard – for instance the policy not to buy products made
              | through the use of child labor – is in fact a hidden enforcement of a competitive dis-
              | advantage for Third World countries, implying additional hardship for the poor. In
              | many countries, child labor is a crucial source of family income and low wages are one
              | of the few competitive advantages of the economies of the South. The same argument
              | can be made with regard to standards of environmental protection. To make this
              | point more systematically: Altruism might reflect a paternalistic definition of interests
              | of the South13 by people in the North that have little to do with the interests people of
              | the South actually have. This suspicion of paternalistic definition of interests became
              | an important dispute between NGOs from the North and the South in the anti-
              | globalization movement in recent years.
              | Conclusion
              | What can we learn from the proposed distinction of types of moral behavior in mar-
              | kets? The argument pursued in this paper was that the role of morality for market
              | outcomes is deeply ambivalent. Market-liberal objections to any type of coordination
              | truism, the concrete values at stake must be considered. This presupposes a principle for the
              | regulation of value conflicts.
              | 13 This is parallel to Lukes (1974) third face of power.

text          | devices but self-interest don’t do justice to the problems emerging from unequal ini-
              | tial endowments, monopolistic market structures, external effects, free-riding and
              | principal-agent problems. This, on the other hand, does not imply that morality based
              | decision-making can be seen as unequivocally positive for the efficiency of market
              | outcomes. Morality might be discriminatory to outsiders, hinder the functional dif-
              | ferentiation of the economy and block markets that would be beneficial for at least
              | some market participants.
              | These profound ambivalences disqualify all positions of unqualified rejection of mo-
              | rality as an action orientation of market participants. However, they also pinpoint to
              | benefits of demoralization of market exchange. The typology introduced identifies
              | different implications of morality for the efficiency of market outcomes for the differ-
              | ent types. Mostly positive effects can be attributed to cooperation, i.e., moral behavior
              | in the context of problems associated with free-riding and principal-agent situations.
              | In these situations, ethical codes are one mechanism by which market failure can be
              | avoided and more efficient outcomes achieved. By contrast, exchange blockages ap-
              | pear profoundly ambiguous, as they represent values in a society. As an ideal type,
              | their enforcement is independent from their consequences for personal utility and
              | macroeconomic welfare effects. They can nevertheless contribute to economic well-
              | being, for instance by blocking the purchase of political decisions (corruption). They
              | can, on the other hand, prevent the functional differentiation of the economy and
              | might result in unintended consequences like the emergence of illegal markets. While
              | it might be politically decided to reduce the scope of markets by legally blocking the
              | exchange of certain goods and services, these non-intended consequences must be
              | reflected in any consequentialist moral judgment of such restrictions. Altruism trans-
              | ports substantial value orientations into the realm of the economy as well. Its evalua-
              | tion depends on the values that are enacted but also on the unintended effects it
              | causes. Altruism can give moral justification to redistributive policies and thereby
              | help to integrate the issue of equity into a market economy. Group solidarity has am-
              | bivalent consequences too. It can lead to the cartelization of market exchange and it
              | excludes outsiders. On the other hand, it can also help stabilize markets, reduce power
              | differentials between different social groups and help to pool resources for invest-
              | ments that would otherwise be unobtainable. Finally, Trojan altruism is a parasitic use
              | of morality that does not find moral legitimation. Its effects are clearly negative, based
              | on the criterion of Pareto efficiency, since it aims at gaining advantages at the cost of
              | the other side of the exchange.
              | While the typology does not lead to unambiguous distinctions with regard to the wel-
              | fare effects of the four specific forms of commitment based behavior, it does provide
              | insights into the specific problems which are characteristic for the different types.
              | Moreover, it indicates that the moral embeddedness of the economy is not a dysfunc-
              | tional relic from premodern times but rather an integral part of the efficient function-
              | ing of markets. At the same time, the role of morality in the market cannot be reduced
              | to its economic functions. The observation of inefficiencies due to moral orientations

              | of actors does not itself give justification to condemn these expressions of value ra-
              | tionality. Instead, they demonstrate that economies work within the context of a
              | moral universe that itself cannot be reduced to criteria of economic efficiency. The
              | ambivalence of morality for market outcomes is due to the fact that markets necessar-
              | ily operate within a social field in which economic and non-economic values merge.
              | This can be beneficial to economic outcomes or inhibit economic efficiency. The
              | theoretical insight emerging from the ambivalent role of morality on markets is that
              | no economy will ever be “only economic” even if this inhibits some of its economic
              | functions.
