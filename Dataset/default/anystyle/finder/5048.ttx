              | For Whom the Gate Tolls?
              | How and Why to Free the Refereed Research Literature
              | Online Through Author/Institution Self-Archiving, Now
              | Stevan Harnad ∗
              | Abstract: All refereed journals will soon be available
              | online; most of them already are. This means that anyone
              | will be able to access them from any networked desk-top.
              | The literature will all be interconnected by citation, author,
              | and keyword/subject links, allowing for unheard-of power
              | and ease of access and navigability. Successive drafts of
              | pre-refereeing preprints will be linked to the official refe-
              | reed draft, as well as to any subsequent corrections, revi-
              | sions, updates, comments, responses, and underlying em-
              | pirical databases, all enhancing the self-correctiveness, in-
              | teractivity and productivity of scholarly and scientific re-
              | search and communication in remarkable new ways. New
              | scientometric indicators of digital impact are also emerging
              | (http://opcit.eprints.
              | org) to chart the online course of knowledge. But there is
              | still one last frontier to cross before science reaches the op-
              | timal and the inevitable: Just as there is no longer any need
              | for research or researchers to be constrained by the access-
              | blocking restrictions of paper distribution, there is no longer
              | any need to be constrained by the impact-blocking financial
              | fire-walls of Subscription/Site-License/Pay-Per-View (S/L/P)
              | tolls for this give-away literature. Its authors/researchers
              | have always donated their research reports for free (and its

              | harvested into global, jointly searchable "virtual archives"

              | bly) more interactive and productive, spawning its own new
              | digital metrics of productivity and impact, allowing for an
              | online "embryology of knowledge."

              | A brand-new PhD recipient proudly tells his mother he has just pub-
              | lished his first article. She asks him how much he was paid for it. He
              | makes a face and tells her "nothing," and then begins a long, compli-
              | cated explanation ...
              | A fellow-researcher at that same university sees a reference to that
              | same article. He goes to their library to get it: "It's not subscribed to
              | here. We can't afford that journal. (Our subscription/license/loan/copy
              | budget is already overspent.)"
              | An undergraduate at that same university sees the same article cited on
              | the Web. He clicks on it. The publisher's website demands a password:
              | "Access Denied: Only pre-paid subscribing/licensed institutions have
              | access to this journal."
              | The undergraduate loses patience, gets bored, and clicks on Napster to
              | grab an MP3 file of his favorite bootleg CD to console him in his sor-
              | rows.
              | Years later, the same PhD is being considered for tenure. His publica-
              | tions are good, but they're not cited enough; they have not made enough
              | of a "research impact." Tenure denied.
              | Same thing happens when he tries to get a research grant: His research
              | findings have not had enough of an impact: Not enough researchers
              | have read, built upon and cited them. Funding denied.

              | it: "It wouldn't sell enough copies because not enough universities have
              | enough money to pay for it. (Their purchasing budgets are tied up pay-
              | ing for their inflating annual journal subscription/license/loan costs ...)"
              | He tries to put his articles up on the Web, free for all, to increase their
              | impact. His publisher threatens to sue him and his server-provider for
              | violation of copyright.
              | He asks his publisher: "Who is this copyright intended to protect?" His
              | publisher replies: "You!"

              | not want them to?)
              | Resolving the Anomaly:
              | How a few critical distinctions plus a few simple actions can restore sense to it
              | all.
              | 1. Five Essential PostGutenberg Distinctions:
              | In order to understand what is wrong with the picture, you first have to make
              | five critical distinctions. If you fail to make any one of these distinctions, it will
              | be impossible to make sense of the picture or to resolve the anomaly, an anom-
              | aly completely unique to the online era of "Scholarly Skywriting" (Harnad
              | 1990) in the "PostGutenberg Galaxy" (Harnad 1991).
              | 1.1 Distinguish the non-give-away literature
              | from the give-away literature
              | This is the most important PostGutenberg distinction of all. It is what makes
              | this small refereed research literature anomalous (about 24,000 refereed jour-
              | nals, about 2,500,000 articles annually) – fundamentally unlike the bulk of the
              | written literature: Its authors do not seek, nor do they receive, royalties or fees
              | for their writings. Their texts are author give-aways (Harnad 1995a). The only
              | thing these authors seek is research "impact" (Harnad & Carr 2000), which
              | comes from accessing the eyes and minds of all potentially interested fellow-
              | researchers everywhere, now, and any time in the future.
meta          | 78
text          | The litmus test for whether a piece of writing falls in the small give-away
              | sector of the literature or the much larger non-give-away sector is: "Does the
              | author seek a royalty or fee in exchange for his writings?" If the answer is yes
              | (as it is for virtually all books [cf. Harnad, Varian & Parks 2000] and newspa-
              | per or magazine articles), then the writing is non-give-away; if the answer is
              | no, then it is give-away.
              | None of what follows here is applicable to non-give-away writing, but the
              | non-give-away model is the one that most people have in mind for all of writ-
              | ing. So it is not surprising that that small fraction of writing that the more gen-
              | eral model does not fit should seem anomalous.
              | 1.2 Distinguish income (arising from article sales) from
              | impact (arising from article use)
              | Unlike all other authors, researchers derive their income not from the sale of
              | their research reports but from the scholarly/scientific impact of their reported
              | findings, i.e., how much they are read, cited, and built-upon by other research-
              | ers. Hence all fee-based access-barriers are income-barriers for research and
              | researchers (Harnad 1998a), restricting their potential impact to only those
              | (institutions, mainly) who can and do pay the access-fees.
              | As most institutions cannot afford the access-fees to most refereed research
              | journals, this means that most research papers cannot be accessed by most
              | researchers (Harnad 1998b): Currently, all that potential impact is simply lost.
meta          | 79
text          | Note that although researchers do not derive income from the sale of their
              | refereed research papers ("imprint income"), they do derive income from the
              | impact of those papers ("impact income").
              | The simple reason why researchers, unlike non-give-away authors, do not
              | seek imprint-income for their refereed research is that the access-tolls for col-
              | lecting imprint-income are barriers to impact-income (research grants, salaries,
              | promotion, tenure, prizes), which is by far the more important reward for re-
              | searchers, most of whose refereed papers are so esoteric (Harnad 1995b) as to
              | have no imprint-income market at all.
              | 1.3 Distinguish between copyright protection from
              | theft-of-authorship (plagiarism) and copyright protection
              | from theft-of-text (piracy)
              | These two very different aspects of copyright protection have always been
              | conflated (Harnad 1999b), because it is the much larger and more representa-
              | tive non-give-away literature that has always been the model for copyright law
              | and copyright concerns. But copyright protection from theft-of-authorship
              | (plagiarism), which is essential for both give-away and non-give-away authors,
              | has nothing at all to do with copyright protection from theft-of-text (piracy),
              | which non-give-away authors want but give-away authors do not want. One
              | can have full protection from plagiarism without seeking any protection from
              | piracy.
              | 1.4 Distinguish self-publishing (vanity press) from
              | self-archiving (of published, refereed research)
              | The essential difference between unrefereed research and refereed research is
              | quality-control (peer review, Harnad 1998/2000) and its certification (by an
              | established peer-reviewed journal of known quality). Although researchers
              | have always wished to give away their refereed research findings, they still
              | wish them to be refereed, and certified as having met established quality stan-
              | dards. Hence the self-archiving of refereed research should in no way be con-
              | fused with self-publishing, for it includes as its most important component, the
              | online self-archiving, free for all, of refereed, published research papers.
              | 1.5 Distinguish unrefereed preprints from refereed
              | postprints ("eprints" = preprints + postprints)
              | Eprint archives, consisting of research papers self-archived online by their
              | authors, are not, and have never been, merely "preprint archives" for unrefereed
              | research. Authors can self-archive therein all the embryological stages of the
meta          | 80
text          | research they wish to report, from pre-refereeing, through successive revisions,
              | till the refereed, journal-certified postprint, and thence still further, to any sub-
              | sequent corrected, revised, or otherwise updated drafts (post-postprints), as
              | well as any commentaries or responses linked to them. These are all just way-
              | stations along the scholarly skywriting continuum.

              | All papers citation-interlinked
              | Fully searchable, navigable, retrievable
              | For free, for all, forever
              | All of this will come to pass. The only real question is "How soon?" Will we
              | still be compos mentis and fit to benefit from it, or will it only be for the napster
              | generation? Future historians, posterity, and our own still-born scholarly im-
              | pact are already poised to chide us in hindsight (Harnad 1999b).
              | What can the research community do to hasten the optimal and inevitable?
              | Here are some recent concepts that may help.
              | 3. Two Useful Acronyms, One New Distinction,
              | and One New Ally
              | 3.1 S/L/P [Subscription/Site-License/Pay-Per-View] tolls:
              | The impact/access-barriers
              | Access-tolls are the access-barriers, hence the impact-barriers, for researchers
              | and their give-away research. Access-tolls are the journal publisher's means of
              | recovering costs and making a fair profit. High costs were inescapable in the
              | expensive and inefficient on-paper Gutenberg era; but today, in the on-line
              | PostGutenberg era, continuing to do it all the old Gutenberg way, with its high
              | costs, must be clearly seen as the optional add-on (for this give-away literature
              | only: not for the royalty/fee-based literature!) that it has become, rather than as
              | the obligatory feature it used to be.
              | Beware of the language of obligatory "value-added," with which the peer-
              | reviewed literature must, by implication, continue to be inextricably wrapped.
              | The only essential service still provided by journal publishers (for this anoma-
              | lous, author-give-away literature in the PostGutenberg era) is peer review itself.
meta          | 81
text          | The rest – on-paper versions, PDF on-line page images, deluxe online en-
              | hancements – are all potentially valuable features, to be sure, but only as take-
              | it-or-leave-it options. In the on-line era there is no longer any necessity, hence
              | no longer any justification whatsoever, for continuing to hold the refereed
              | research itself hostage to access-tolls and whatever add-ons they happen to pay
              | for.
              | Beware also of any attempt to trade off S for L or L for P: Pick your poison,
              | all three are access-barriers, hence impact-barriers, and hence all three must go
              | – or rather, they must all now become only the price-tags for the add-on, deluxe
              | options that they buy for the researcher and his institution, but no longer also
              | for the peer-reviewed essentials, which can now be self-archived for free for
              | all.
              | 3.2 Peer review
              | Peer review itself is not a deluxe add-on for research and researchers: This
              | quality-control service and its certification is an essential (Harnad 1998/2000).
              | Without peer review the research literature would be neither reliable nor navi-
              | gable, its quality uncontrolled, unfiltered, un-sign-posted, unknown, unac-
              | countable.
              | But the peers who review it for the journals are the researchers themselves,
              | and they review it for free, just as the researchers report it for free. So it must
              | be made quite clear that the only real peer-review cost is that of implementing
              | the peer review, not actually performing it.
              | Estimates (e.g., Odlyzko 1998) as well as the real experience of online-only
              | journals (e.g., Journal of High Energy Physics http://jhep.cern.ch/; Psycoloquy
              | http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/psycoloquy/) have shown that the peer-review
              | implementation cost is quite low – about 10-30% of the total amount that the
              | world's institutional libraries (or rather, the small subset of them that can afford
              | any given journal at all!) are currently paying annually per article in access-
              | tolls .
              | Once the 70-90% toll-based add-ons become optional, the essential 10-30%
              | peer-review cost could easily be paid out of the 100% toll savings – if ever the
              | world's libraries decide they no longer need the add-ons. (The other 70-90%
              | savings can be used to buy other things, e.g., books, which are not, and never
              | will be, author give-aways.)
              | 3.3 Separating (i) peer-review service-provision from (ii) eprint
              | access-provision (and from (iii) optional add-ons)
              | Researchers need not and should not wait until journal publishers voluntarily
              | decide to separate the provision of the essential peer-review service from all the
              | other optional add-on products (on-paper version, publisher's PDF version,
meta          | 82
text          | deluxe enhancements) before their give-away refereed research can at last be
              | freed of all access- and impact-barriers.
              | All researchers can free their own refereed research now, virtually over-
              | night, by taking the matter into their own hands; they can self-archive it in their
              | institutional Eprint Archives: http://www.eprints.org. Access to the eprints of
              | their refereed research is then immediately freed of all toll-barriers, forever.
              | 3.4 Interoperability: The Open Archive Initiative (OAI)
              | Papers self-archived by their authors in their institutional Eprint Archives can
              | be accessed by anyone, anywhere, with no need to know their actual location,
              | because all Eprints Archives are compliant with the Open Archives Initia-
              | tive (OAI) meta-data tagging protocol for interoperability: http://www.
              | openarchives.org.
              | Because of their OAI-compliance, the papers in all registered Eprints Ar-
              | chives can be harvested and searched by Open Archive Services such as Cite-
              | Base (http://cite-base.ecs.soton.ac.uk/help/index.php3) and the Cross Archive

text          | 4. The Subversive Proposal
              | 4.1 Enough to free entire refereed corpus, forever, immediately
              | Eight steps will be described here. The first four are not hypothetical in any
              | way; they are guaranteed to free the entire refereed research literature (~24K
              | journals annually) from its access/impact-barriers right away. The only thing
              | that researchers and their institutions need to do is to take these first four steps.
              | The second four steps are hypothetical predictions, but nothing hinges on them:
              | The refereed literature will already be free for everyone as a result of steps i-iv,
              | irrespective of the outcome of predictions v-viii.
              | i. Universities install and register OAI-compliant Eprint Archives
              | (http://www.eprints.org).
              | The Eprints software is free and will be open-sourced. It in turn uses only free
              | software; it is quick and easy to install and maintain; it is OAI-compliant and
              | will be kept compliant with every OAI upgrade: http://www.openarchives.org/.
              | Eprints Archives are all interoperable with one another and can hence be har-
              | vested and searched (e.g., http://arc.cs.odu.edu/) as if they were all in one glo-
              | bal "virtual" archive of the entire research literature, both pre- and post-
              | refereeing.
              | ii. Authors self-archive their pre-refereeing preprints and post-
              | refereeing postprints in their own university's Eprint Archives.
              | This is the most important step; it is insufficient to create the Eprint Archives.
              | All researchers must self-archive their papers therein if the literature is to be
              | freed of its access- and impact-barriers. Self-archiving is quick and easy; it
              | need only be done once per paper, and the result is permanent, and permanently
              | and automatically uploadable to upgrades of the Eprint Archives and the OAI-
              | protocol.
              | iii. Universities subsidize a first start-up wave of self-archiving by
              | proxy where needed.
              | Self-archiving is quick and easy, but there is no need for it to be held back if
              | any researcher feels too busy, tired, old or otherwise unable to do it for himself:
              | Library staff or students can be paid to "self-archive" the first wave of papers
              | by proxy on their behalf. The cost will be negligibly low per paper, and the
              | benefits will be huge; moreover, there will be no need for a second wave of
              | help once the palpable benefits (access and impact) of freeing the literature
              | begin to be felt by the research community. Self-archiving will become second-
meta          | 84
text          | nature to all researchers as the objective digitometric indicators of its effects on
              | citations and usage become available online (Harnad 2001e; Lawrence 2001a,
              | 2001b) (e.g., cite-base or ResearchIndex).
              | iv. The give-away corpus is freed from all access /
              | impact barriers on-line.
              | Once a critical mass of researchers has self-archived, the refereed research
              | literature is at last free of all access- and impact-barriers, as it was always des-
              | tined to be.
              | 4.2 Hypothetical sequel
              | Steps i-iv are sufficient to free the refereed research literature. We can also
              | guess at what may happen after that, but these are really just guesses. Nor does
              | anything depend on their being correct. For even if there is no change whatso-
              | ever – even if Universities continue to spend exactly the same amounts on their
              | access-toll budgets as they do now – the refereed literature will have been freed
              | of all access/impact barriers forever.
              | However, it is likely that there will be some changes as a consequence of the
              | freeing of the literature by author/institution self-archiving. This is what those
              | changes might be:
meta          | 85
text          | v. Users will prefer the free version?
              | It is likely that once a free, online version of the refereed research literature is
              | available, not only those researchers who could not access it at all before, be-
              | cause of toll-barriers at their institution, but virtually all researchers will prefer
              | to use the free online versions.
              | Note that it is quite possible that there will always continue to be a market
              | for the toll-based options (on-paper version, publisher's on-line PDF, deluxe
              | enhancements) even though most users use the free versions. Nothing hangs on
              | this.
              | vi. Publisher toll revenues shrink, library toll savings grow?
              | But if researchers do prefer to use the free online literature, it is possible that
              | libraries may begin to cancel journals, and as their windfall toll savings grow,
              | journal publisher toll revenues will shrink. The extent of the cancellation will
              | depend on the extent to which there remains a market for the toll-based add-
              | ons, and for how long.
              | If the toll-access market stays large enough, nothing else need change.
              | vii. Publishers downsize to providers of peer-review service and op-
              | tional add-ons products?
              | It will depend entirely on the size of the remaining market for the toll-based
              | options whether and to what extent journal publishers will have to down-size to
              | providing only the essentials: The only essential, indispensable service is peer
              | review.
              | viii. Peer-review service costs funded by author-institution out of
              | reader-institution toll savings?
              | If publishers can continue to cover costs and make a decent profit from the toll-
              | based optional add-ons market, without needing to down-size to peer-review
              | provision alone, nothing much changes.
              | But if publishers do need to abandon providing the toll-based products and
              | to scale down instead to providing only the peer-review service, then universi-
              | ties, having saved 100% of their annual access-toll budgets, will have plenty of
              | annual windfall savings from which to pay for their own researchers' continu-
              | ing (and essential) annual journal-submission peer-review costs (10-30%); the
              | rest of their savings (70-90%) they can spend as they like (e.g., on books – plus
              | a bit for Eprint Archive maintenance).

text          | 5. PostGutenberg Copyright Concerns
              | There is a great deal of concern about copyright in the digital age, and some of
              | it may not be easily resolvable (e.g., what to do about the pirating of software
              | and music). But none of that need detain us here, because digital piracy is only
              | a problem for non-give-away work, whereas we are concerned here only with
              | give-away work. (Again, failing to make the give-away/non-give-away distinc-
              | tion leads only to confusion, and the misapplication of the much bigger and
              | more representative non-give-away model to the anomalous give-away corpus,
              | which it does not fit.)
              | The following digital copyright concerns are relevant to the non-give-away
              | literature only:
              | 5.1 Protecting intellectual property (royalties)
              | This is as much of a concern to authors of books as to authors of screenplays,
              | music, and computer programs. It is also a concern to performers who have
              | made digital audio or video disks of their work. They do not wish to see that
              | work stolen; they want their fair share of the gate-receipts in return for their
              | talent and efforts in producing the work.
              | But the producers of refereed research reports do not wish to have protection
              | from "theft" of this kind; on the contrary, they wish to encourage it. They have
              | no royalties to gain from preventing it; they have only research impact to lose
              | from access-blockage of any kind.
              | 5.2 Allowing fair use (user issue)
              | "Fair use" is another worthy concern. It has to do with certain sanctioned uses
              | of non-give-away material, such as all or parts of books, magazine articles, etc.,
              | often for teaching purposes; the producers of these works do not wish to lose
              | their potential royalty/fee-income from these works.
              | The producers of refereed research reports, in contrast, wish to give their
              | work away; hence fair-use issues are moot for this special give-away literature.
              | 5.3 Preventing theft of text (piracy)
              | The producers of refereed research reports do not wish to prevent the theft of
              | their texts; they wish to facilitate it as much as possible. (In the on-paper era
              | they used to purchase and mail reprints to requesters at their own expense!)
meta          | 87
text          | The following digital copyright concern is relevant to all literature, both give-
              | away and non-give-away:
              | 5.4 Preventing theft of authorship (plagiarism)
              | No author wants any other author to claim to have been the author of his work.
              | This concern is shared by all authors, give-away and non-give-away. But it has
              | nothing whatsoever to do with concerns about theft-of-text, and should not be
              | conflated with such concerns in any way: Give-away work need not be held
              | hostage to non-give-away concerns about theft-of-text under the pretext of
              | "protecting" it from theft-of-authorship. (Unfortunately, many journal publish-
              | ers try to write and use their copyright transfer agreements for precisely this
              | purpose, and authors need to become aware of it.)
              | The following digital copyright concern is relevant to the give-away literature
              | only:
              | 5.5 Guaranteeing author give-away rights
              | Apart from the protection from plagiarism and the assurance of priority that all
              | authors seek, the only other "protection" the give-away author of refereed re-
              | search reports seeks is protection of his give-away rights!
              | (The intuitive model for this is advertisements: what advertiser wants to lose
              | his right to give away his ads for free, diminishing their potential impact by
              | charging for access to them!)
              | Well, there is no need for the authors of refereed research to worry about
              | exercising their give-away rights, for they can do it, legally, even under the
              | most restrictive copyright agreement, by using the following strategy.
              | 6. How to Get Around Restrictive Copyright Legally
              | ("Preprint+Corrigenda Strategy")
              | 6.1 Self-archive the pre-refereeing preprint
              | Self-archiving the preprint is the critical first step. Before it has even been
              | submitted to a journal, your intellectual property is your own, and not bound by
              | any future copyright transfer agreement. So archive the preprints (as physicists
              | have done for 10 years now, with over 150,000 papers, and cognitive scientists
              | have done for 3 years now, with over 1000 papers). This is a good way to es-
              | tablish priority, elicit informal feedback, and keep a public record of the em-
              | bryology of knowledge.

text          | [Note that some journals have, apart from copyright policies, which are a le-
              | gal matter,embargo policies," which are merely policy matters (nonlegal).
              | Invoking the "Ingelfinger (Embargo) Rule," some journals state that they will
              | not referee (let alone publish) papers that have previously been "made public"
              | in any way, whether through conferences, press releases, or on-line self-
              | archiving. The Ingelfinger Rule, apart from being directly at odds with the
              | interests of research and researchers and having no intrinsic justification what-
              | soever – other than as a way of protecting journals' current revenue streams – is
              | not a legal matter, and unenforceable. So researchers are best advised to ignore
              | it completely (Harnad 2000a, 2000b), exactly as the authors of the 150,000
              | papers in the Physics Archive have been doing for ten years now. The Ingelfin-
              | ger Rule is under review by journals in any case; Nature has already dropped it,
              | and there are indications that Science may soon follow suit too.]
              | 6.2 Submit the preprint for refereeing (revise etc.)
              | Nothing changes in author publication practises; nothing needs to be given up.
              | Submit your preprint to the refereed journal of your choice, and revise it as
              | usual in accordance with the directive of the Editor and the advice of the refe-
              | rees.
              | 6.3 At acceptance, try to fix the copyright transfer agreement
              | to allow self-archiving
              | Copyright transfer agreements take many forms. Whatever the wording is, if it
              | does not explicitly permit online self-archiving, modify it so that it does. Here
              | is a sample way to word it (http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/copyright.html):
              | I hereby transfer to [publisher or journal] all rights to sell or lease the text (on-
              | paper and on-line) of my paper [paper-title]. I retain only the right to distribute
              | it for free for scholarly/scientific purposes, in particular, the right to self-
              | archive it publicly online on the Web.
              | Some publishers (about 10-30%) already explicitly allow self-archiving of
              | the refereed postprint (e.g., the American Physical Society: http://forms.aps.
              | org/author/copytrnsfr.pdf). Most other publishers (perhaps 70%) also accept
              | this clause, but only if you explicitly propose it yourself (they will not formu-
              | late it on their own initiative).
meta          | 89
text          | 6.4 If 6.3 is successful, self-archive the refereed postprint
              | Hence, for about 80% of journals, once you have done the above, you can go
              | ahead and self-archive your paper.
              | Some journals (about 20%), however, will respond that they decline to pub-
              | lish your paper unless you sign their copyright transfer agreement verbatim. In
              | such cases, sign their agreement and proceed to the next step:
              | 6.5 If 6.3 is unsuccessful, archive the"corrigenda"
              | Your pre-refereeing preprint has already been self-archived since prior to sub-
              | mission, and is not covered by the copyright agreement, which pertains to the
              | revised final ("value-added") draft. Hence all you need to do is to self-archive a
              | further file, linked to the archived preprint, which simply lists the corrections
              | that the reader may wish to make in order to conform the preprint to the refe-
              | reed, accepted version.
              | Everyone chuckles at this point, but the reason it is so easy is that this is the
              | author give-away literature. No non-give-away author would ever dream of
              | doing such a thing (archiving the prepublication draft for free, along with the
              | corrigenda). And copyright agreements (and copyright law) are designed and
              | conceived to meet the much more representative interests of non-give-away
              | authors and their much larger body of royalty/fee-based work. Hence this sim-
              | ple and legal expedient for the special, tiny, anomalous, give-away literature
              | has no constituency anywhere else.
              | Yet this simple, risible strategy is also feasible, and legal (Oppenheim 2001)
              | – and sufficient to free the entire current refereed corpus of all access/impact
              | barriers immediately!
              | 7. What You Can Do Now to Free the Refereed Literature
              | Online
              | 7.1 Researchers: Self-archive all present, future (& past) papers
              | The freeing of their present and future refereed research from all access- and
              | impact-barriers forever is now entirely in the hands of researchers. Posterity is
              | looking over our shoulders, and will not judge us flatteringly if we continue to
              | delay the optimal and inevitable needlessly, now that it is clearly within our
              | reach. Physicists have already shown the way, but at their current self-
              | archiving rate, even they will take another decade to free the entire Physics
              | literature (http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/Tim/sld002.htm) – with
meta          | 90
text          | the Cognitive Sciences (http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk) 39 times slower still, and
              | most of the remaining disciplines not even started: http://www.cogsci.
              | soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/Tim/sld004.htm.
              | This is why it is hoped that (with the help of the eprints.org institutional ar-
              | chive-creating software) distributed, institution-based self-archiving, as a pow-
              | erful and natural complement to central, discipline-based self-archiving, will
              | now broaden and accelerate the self-archiving initiative, putting us all over the
              | top at last, with the entire distributed corpus integrated by the glue of interop-
              | erability (http://www.openarchives.org).
              | As to the past (retrospective) literature: The preprint+corrigenda strategy
              | will not work there, but as the retrospective journal literature brings virtually
              | no revenue, most publishers will agree to author self-archiving after a sufficient
              | period (six months to two years) has elapsed. Moreover, for the really old lit-
              | erature, it is not clear that on-line self-archiving was covered by the old copy-
              | right agreements at all.
              | And if all else fails for the retrospective literature, a variant of the pre-
              | print+corrigenda strategy will still work: Simply do a revised 2nd edition!
              | Update the references, rearrange the text (and add more text and data if you
              | wish). For the record, the enhanced draft can be accompanied by a "de-
              | corrigenda" file, stating which of the enhancements were not in the published
              | version.
              | (And of course the starting point for the revised, enhanced 2nd edition, if
              | you no longer have the digital text in your word processor, can be scanned and
              | OCR'd from the journal; by thus distributing it, authors can do for their own
              | work for-free what JSTOR http://www.jstor.org/ is only able to do for the work
              | of others for-fee.)
              | 7.2 Universities: Install Eprint Archives, mandate them;
              | help in author start-up
              | Universities should create institutional Eprint Archives (e.g., CalTech) for all
              | their researchers. They should also mandate that they be filled. http://www.
              | eprints.org/signup/sign.php It is already becoming normal practise for faculty
              | to keep and update their institutional CVs online on the Web; it should be made
              | standard practise that all CV entries for refereed journal articles are linked to
              | their archived full-text version in the university's Eprint Archive.
              | For researchers who profess to be too busy, tired, old, or inexpert to self-
              | archive their papers for themselves, a modest start-up budget to pay library
              | experts or students to do it for them would be a small amount of money very

              | author start-up
              | Libraries are the most natural allies of researchers in the self-archiving initia-
              | tive to free the refereed journal literature. Not only are they groaning under the
              | yoke of the growing serials budget crisis, but librarians are also eager to estab-
              | lish a new digital niche for themselves, once the journal corpus is on-line:
              | Maintaining the Eprint Archives, and facilitating the all-important start-up
              | wave of self-archiving (by being ready to do "proxy" self-archiving on behalf
              | of authors who feel they cannot do it for themselves), will be a critical role for
              | libraries to play.
              | Libraries can also facilitate a stable transition through their collective, con-
              | sortial power (SPARC: http://www.arl.org/sparc), providing leveraged support
              | for publishers who are prepared to commit themselves to a scheduled for
              | downsizing to the essentials only (the peer review service, to the author/-
              | institution). And individually they can also be preparing in advance for the
              | restructuring that will come if their windfall toll savings grow; about 10-30%
              | of their annual savings will need to be redirected to cover their university's own
              | authors' peer-review charges per paper. The remaining 70-90% is theirs to use

              | Students are well-advised to keep doing what they do naturally: Favor material
              | that is freely accessible on the Web. This will not net them very much of the
              | non-give-away literature, but it will put consumer pressure on the give-away
              | research literature, especially as these students come of age, and become re-
              | searchers in their turn.

text          | 7.5 Publishers: Concede graciously on self-archiving and be
              | prepared to separate essential peer-review service costs
              | (to the author-institution) from optional add-on product costs
              | (to the reader-institution)
              | Publishers should concede graciously on self-archiving as the American Physi-
              | cal Society (APS) has done and not try to use copyright or embargo policy to
              | prevent or retard it. Such measures are in direct conflict with the interests of
              | research and researchers, they are destined to fail, they can already be legally
              | circumvented, and they only make publishers look bad.
              | A much better policy is to concede on the optimal and inevitable for re-
              | search, and plan on the possibility of separating the provision of the essential
              | peer review service to the author-institution (peer review implementation
              | charges, per paper) from the provision of all other add-on products (e.g., on-
              | paper version, on-line version, other added-values), which should be sold as
              | options, rather than used to try to keep holding the essentials (the refereed final
              | draft) hostage to access-tolls.
              | There will still be a permanent niche for journal publishers. What remains to
              | be seen is whether that will entail downsizing to peer-review service-provision
              | alone, or whether there will also continue to be a market for toll-based add-ons
              | even after the refereed drafts are available free through the Eprint Archives.
              | 7.6 Government/society: Mandate public archiving of
              | public research worldwide
              | Government and society should support the self-archiving initiative, reminding
              | themselves that most of this giveaway research has been supported by public
              | funds, with the support explicitly conditional on making the research findings
              | public (http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/281/5382/1459). In the
              | PostGutenberg Galaxy there is no longer any need for that public accessibility
              | to be blocked by toll-barriers.
              | The beneficiaries will not just be research and researchers, but society itself,
              | inasmuch as research is supported because of its potential benefits to society.
              | Researchers in developing countries and at the less affluent universities and
              | research institutions of developed countries will benefit even more from bar-
              | rier-free access to the research literature than will the better-off institutions, but
              | it is instructive to remind ourselves that even the most affluent institutional
              | libraries cannot afford most of the refereed journals! None have access to more
              | than a small subset of the entire annual corpus (http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/
              | arl/index.html). So free access to it all will benefit all institutions (Odlyzko
              | 1999a, 1999b).
              | And on the other side of barrier-free access to the work of others, all re-
              | searchers, even the most affluent, will benefit from the barrier-free impact of
meta          | 93
text          | their own work on the work of others. Moreover, a freed, interoperable, digital
              | research literature will not only radically enhance access, navigation (e.g.,
              | citation-linking) and impact, hence research productivity and quality, but it will
              | also spawn new ways of monitoring and measuring that impact, productivity
              | and quality (e.g., download impact, links, immediacy, comments, and the
              | higher-order dynamics of a citation-linked corpus that can be analyzed from
              | preprint to post-postprint, to yield an "embryology of knowledge" (Harnad &
              | Carr 2000).
              | 8. Prima-Facie FAQs for Overcoming Zeno's Paralysis
              | "I worry about self-archiving because ...":
              | Researchers, librarians, publishers and university administrators have so far
              | been held back from self-archiving by certain prima facie worries, all of which
              | are easily shown to be groundless.
              | These worries are rather like "Zeno's Paradox":
              | "I cannot walk across this room, because before I can walk across it, I must
              | first walk half-way across it, and that takes time; but before I can walk half-
              | way across it, I must walk half-half-way across it, and that too takes time; and
              | so on; so I how can I ever even get started?"
              | This condition might better be called "Zeno's Paralysis."
              | Each of the following worries can easily be shown to be groundless (and has
              | been shown to be groundless, by myself and many others, many times). Yet the
              | very same prima facie worries keep resurging elsewhere, like mushrooms, no
              | matter how decisively they are uprooted in each instance. It will be a matter for
              | future historians to explain the puzzle of why we were needlessly held back for
              | so long from the optimal and inevitable even when it was well within reach, by
              | these gratuitous worries (despite the "Los Alamos Lemma," which is that what-
              | ever alleged obstacle was not sufficient to deter physicists from self-archiving
              | 130,000 papers to date should not be holding back the rest of us either!).
              | Here are rebuttals to the most common of these prima facie worries; in fu-
              | ture they can be used as FAQs to reply by number: They are brief and to the
              | point, because there are no long, complex, hidden issues in any of these cases.
              | Hence it is best to get to the point in the simplest, most direct way possible.
              | There is also a good deal of overlap and redundancy between them:
              | 8.1 Preservation
meta          | 94
text          | "I worry about self-archiving because archived eprints may not continue to ex-
              | ist or to be accessible in perpetuo on-line, the way they were on-paper."
              | To put this worry into perspective, we must remember that print-on-paper is
              | not permanent either. The only relevant parameter is the probability of future
              | access. The on-paper probability, such as it is, is achieved by generating (a)
              | multiple copies, (b) geographically distributed, (c) in a (relatively) robust me-
              | dium, (d) visible to the human eye.
              | All four of these properties can be (and have been) achieved on-line too, and
              | the resulting preservation probability can be made as good as, or even better
              | than, the current probability on-paper.
              | That should be the end of the story: For once this concern is no longer
              | grounded in actual, objective probabilities, but only in prior habits and atten-
              | dant intuitions, then we are talking about biases and superstitions and not about
              | actual risks.
              | There are a few side issues: People worry about global power-failures, or
              | global dictatorships. They should remind themselves that these are matters of
              | probability too, and have their equivalents in paper.
              | People also, by analogy with current unreadable documents in obsolete
              | word-processors or peripherals, worry about whether the digital code, even if
              | preserved, will always be accessible and visible to the eye.
              | The answer is again probability: The reason print-on-paper has been faith-
              | fully preserved across generations (when it has been) is that the literate world's
              | collective interests were vested in ensuring that it should do so. This same
              | continuity of collective interests will exist for the digital corpus too, for the
              | same reasons, except that digital code will be much easier to keep uploading to
              | every successive new technology than print on-paper to every successive build-
              | ing or regime ever was.
              | (And there is always the option for those who are still not confident enough
              | in the technology, despite the odds, of printing out hard copies as back-up:
              | Indeed, that is a good way to put the magnitude of one's Zeno's worries to the
              | test: Who will still feel the need to make hard copies, and of how much of the
              | corpus, once it's all on-line and accessible to everyone, everywhere, at all
              | times?)
              | In short, preservation measures as a practical pursuit by digital librarians is
              | an eminently worthy one; but as a basis for any hesitation or delay whatsoever
              | about proceeding with self-archiving right now, it is completely irrational (par-
              | ticularly as, for the time being, self-archiving is merely a supplement to, not a
              | substitute for, the existing Gutenberg modes of preservation).
              | 8.2 Authentication
              | "I worry about self-archiving because you can never be sure whether you are
              | reading the definitive version of an eprint on-line, the way you can be sure on-
              | paper."
meta          | 95
text          | Again, the rational way to put this into context and proportion is to remind
              | ourselves that the authenticity of an on-paper version is just a matter of prob-
              | ability too, and that the very same factors that maximize that probability on-
              | paper can maximize it on-line too. Indeed, if we wish, we can make both the
              | probability and the verifiability of authenticity on-line much higher than it
              | currently is on-paper through techniques such as public hash/time-stamping
              | and encryption.
              | Nor should the authentication issue be confused with the issue of peer-
              | review (8.7) or journal certification (8.5) (separate questions), nor with the
              | question of "version control" (there will be self-archived preprints, revised
              | drafts, final accepted, published drafts [postprints], updated, corrected post-
              | postprints, peer comments, author replies, revised second editions. In all of this,
              | the refereed, accepted final draft is one crucial "milestone," but not the only
              | one, in the embryology of knowledge [and not even always the best one]).
              | And last, some of the "authentication" worries arise from conflating self-
              | archiving and self-publication. To say it in longhand: The main objective of the
              | self-archiving initiative is the freeing of the refereed drafts from access/impact
              | barriers. The refereed draft has already been "authenticated" by the journal that
              | peer-reviewed it. Do not confuse that authentication with some worry you may
              | have about whether this self-archived draft is indeed what the author purports it
              | to be. The only thing the author is "self-certifying" in this case is that this is
              | indeed the journal-certified final draft. There is of course always a possibility
              | that it is not the journal-certified final draft; but that was also true when the
              | author sent you an on-paper reprint. The probabilities can, as usual, be tight-
              | ened to make them as high as we feel comfortable with in either case. And in
              | the case of preservation, self-archiving is at this stage merely a supplement, not
              | a substitute for existing forms of authentication.
              | So, again, there are no rational authentication concerns whatsoever to deter
              | us from self-archiving immediately.
              | 8.3 Corruption
              | "I worry about self-archiving because eprints can be altered or otherwise cor-
              | rupted on-line in ways they could not be corrupted on-paper."
              | If the "authentication" worry (8.2) is the worry about "self-corruption" by
              | the author who has self-archived his own paper, this second "corruption" worry
              | is about "allo-corruption" by parties other than the author.
              | Again, the answer is that simple and effective means are available to ensure
              | that an on-line draft is uncorrupted with as high a probability as we feel we
              | need. So this too is a non-problem. (Nor should it, again, be conflated with self-
              | publication issues, which are irrelevant to the self-archiving of refereed, jour-
              | nal-published papers.) Whatever level of incorruptibility we feel we need, we
              | can have it for self-archived papers too.
meta          | 96
text          | Consequently, corruptibility worries provide no rational basis whatsoever
              | for deterring us from self-archiving immediately.
              | 8.4 Navigation (info-glut)
              | "I worry about self-archiving because there is already too much to read, and it
              | is already too hard to navigate it on paper; adding eprints will just make this
              | situation even worse."
              | This worry deserves even less space than the others. It is incontestable that
              | the information glut (http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/how-much-info/summary.
              | html) is far more navigable and manageable on-line than on-paper (Harnad &
              | Carr 2000).
              | The primary objective of self-archiving is to free the refereed journal litera-
              | ture from access-tolls on-line. That literature is already being published on-
              | paper. (If you think it should not be, it is with the journals and their referees
              | that you need to take issue, not with self-archiving or the on-line medium!)
              | When it is all accessible free on-line, there is no need for anyone to feel any
              | more (or less) obliged to read the refereed literature than they did on-paper.
              | Keeping it off-line is certainly no cure for the information glut (if there is one);
              | it merely makes the existing access-tolls the arbitrary arbiters of whether or not
              | one reads something, rather than the reader's own rational judgement. (And
              | unrefereed preprints can of course always be ignored altogether, if the reader
              | wishes, on-line just as on-paper.)
              | In short, no rational deterrent at all to immediate self-archiving from con-
              | cerns about navigation or information glut.
              | 8.5 Certification
              | "I worry about self-archiving because papers are not certified on-line, the way
              | they are in a journal on-paper."
              | This worry is again based on conflating publication and archiving: The jour-
              | nal publisher (and referees) certify; the archive merely provides access. The
              | author, in self-archiving, "self-certifies" his refereed, published draft as indeed
              | being the one that the journal refereed and published. And this being the case
              | is, as usual, a matter of probability, whether on-line or on-paper. And that
              | probability can be made as high as we feel we need.
              | Again, no rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in the certification
              | worry.
              | "I worry about self-archiving because there is no evaluative process on-line as
              | there is on-paper."
              | 8.6 Evaluation
meta          | 97
text          | Again, a conflation of publishing and archiving: Journal editors and their
              | referees evaluate drafts and revisions, and if/when they are satisfied that their
              | journal's quality standards have been met, they certify the final draft as having
              | met them (peer review). The author self-archives the peer-reviewed postprints
              | (and unrefereed preprints, and perhaps revised post-postprints), tagging them
              | correspondingly. We can decide how high a probability we need that the peer-
              | reviewed draft is indeed the peer-reviewed draft, but that is not the problem of
              | evaluation, but just the question of authentication (8.2) again.
              | So there is no rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving anywhere in the
              | evaluation worry.
              | 8.7 Peer review
              | "I worry about self-archiving because on-line eprints are not refereed, as they
              | are on-paper: What will become of peer review?"
              | Again, a conflation of publishing and archiving: The author self-archives
              | both pre-refereeing preprints and refereed postprints (etc.). The peer review
              | continues to be performed by the referees, as it always was. Peer-review is
              | medium-independent.
              | No rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in the peer-review worry.
              | 8.8 Paying the piper
              | "I worry about self-archiving because someone surely has to pay for all this:
              | you can't get something for nothing!"
              | There are many fallacies embedded in this worry, among them misunder-
              | standings about the nature of global networked communication. Internet con-
              | nectivity, at very low cost, is now part of the infrastructure of most of the
              | world's universities and research institutions. If you are not equally worried

              | be worrying about your self-archiving either. In any case, paying access-tolls is
              | not paying the pertinent piper here anyway!
              | The refereed research literature is minuscule compared to the rest of the traf-
              | fic on the Web (http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/how-much-info/summary.html).
              | It is the flea on the tail of the dog. Worry about the storage and band-width for
              | the growing daily creation and use of audio, video, and multimedia (most of it
              | non-research use!) by researchers at universities and research institutions be-

              | of the archiving/publishing conflation here, thinking that we must find some
              | sort of counterpart for the printing/distribution costs, somewhere. But there isn't
              | any. The price per-paper of permanent online archiving is virtually zero, yet

text          | that has simply vanished in the PostGutenberg Galaxy, leaving only the Chesh-
              | ire Cat's Grin.
              | There is indeed one essential publishing cost that still needs to be paid, but it
              | has nothing to do with Internet use: It is the cost of implementing peer review.
              | That cost, however, as discussed in the peer peview section (3.3), is only 10-
              | 30% of the access-toll costs currently being paid, and hence could easily be
              | paid out of the annual savings.
              | The last of the "who-pays-the-piper" worries is, I think, a variant of the capi-
              | talism (8.14) worry. The best way to dispel it is to note that refereed publishing
              | in the PostGutenberg Galaxy, once the literature has been freed through self-
              | archiving, is likely (apart from whatever optional add-on products and services
              | there may still be a market for) to downsize into a service (peer review), pro-
              | vided to the author-institution, instead of the toll-based product (the text) that
              | was provided to the reader-institution in the Gutenberg era.
              | Nothing hinges on this, however, for as long as the world wants to keep pay-
              | ing for the toll-based product, even after the refereed literature has been self-
              | archived, the piper will be fully paid, yet the literature will be free of all its
              | access/impact barriers.
              | No rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in the who-pays-the-paper
              | worries.
              | 8.9 Downsizing
              | "I worry about self-archiving because it may force journal publishers to shrink
              | to a non-sustainable size, and then where would we be?"
              | No one can predict with certainty the evolutionary path that scien-
              | tific/scholarly journal publishing will take once the refereed corpus has been
              | freed online by self-archiving. The toll-based market for the on-paper version,
              | for the publisher's on-line version or for other options may continue indefi-
              | nitely, or it might shrink but re-stabilize at a lower level, or it might disappear
              | altogether – and this could happen relatively slowly or relatively quickly.
              | It is not clear in advance which of the current established journal publishers
              | will want to continue doing what, under what conditions. The bottom line is
              | that the only remaining essential service will be peer review. If and when that
              | is the only service for which there remains a market, either current journal
              | publishers will be able and willing to downsize to that niche, or they will ter-
              | minate journal operations, in which case their titles (that is, each journal's edi-
              | tor, editorial board, referees, and authorship) will simply migrate to new on-
              | line only journal publishers who are ready to adapt to the new niche [e.g., the
              | Institute of Physics's New Journal of Physics (http://www.njp.org/) and Bio-
              | Med Central (http://www.biomedcentral.com/)].

text          | 8.10 Copyright
              | "I worry about self-archiving because it is illegal, it violates copyright agree-
              | ments, and can jeopardize career and livelihood."
              | Please see the sections on copyright and on legal ways to self-archive de-
              | spite restrictive copyright transfer agreements.
              | In brief, many journals will agree to author self-archiving if the author asks,
              | and for those that don't, self-archiving the preprint before submission and a
              | "corrigenda" file after acceptance is sufficient, and completely legal. What
              | career and livelihood depend on is peer review and impact, and all self-
              | archiving authors continue to have both; neither needs to be sacrificed for the
              | other.
              | No rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in copyright worries.
              | 8.11 Plagiarism
              | "I worry about self-archiving because it is so much easier to steal someone el-
              | se's text on-line, and publish it as one's own, than it is to do so on-paper."
              | This is again a matter of probability: Yes, "it is much easier to steal someone
              | else's text on-line, and publish it as one's own, than it is to do so on-paper," but
              | it is also much easier to detect such thefts on-line; and it is possible to do both
              | (steal and detect) on-paper too.
              | Depending on how important we find it to do so, we can make escape from
              | detection so improbable on-line that it becomes harder to plagiarize on-line
              | than on-paper. It is not clear, however, whether it is even all that important to
              | do so. Worries about plagiarism are usual based on the archiving/publishing
              | conflation: Once one's findings have been refereed and published, it is hard for
              | anyone else to derive any benefit from them at the expense of the author (the
              | peer-reviewed version settles all subsequent authorship disputes).
              | Pre-refereeing preprints are another story; they are dealt with partly in the
              | prior discussion of authentication (8.2), and partly under priority (8.12), below.
              | For refereed postprints, however, refraining from self-archiving them be-
              | cause of worries about plagiarism would be no more rational than refraining
              | from publishing them on-paper in the first place, for the very same reason.
              | 8.12 Priority
              | "I worry about self-archiving because one cannot establish priority on-line as
              | one can on-paper."
              | Establishing priority is again a matter of probability, but it can readily be
              | made much more definitive and reliable on-line than on-paper if we wish. See
              | authentication (8.2).
              | No rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in priority worries.

text          | 8.13 Censorship
              | "I worry about self-archiving because censors could decide what can and can-
              | not appear on-line."
              | This worry too is probably based in part on the usual archiving/publishing
              | conflation (casting the Web and the archive in the role of a publisher who re-
              | fuses to publish your work).
              | It is true that one's on-line literary goods are at the mercy of the archives and
              | archivists. But one's analog on-paper literary goods were likewise at the mercy
              | of the libraries. They could have chosen to "censor" our work too.
              | Again, it is just a matter of deciding how tight we wish to make the prob-
              | abilities in this medium. Mirroring, caching/harvesting and distributed coding
              | already go some way toward taking it out of any potentially sinister local
              | hands.
              | No rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in worries about censor-
              | ship.
              | 8.14 Capitalism
              | "I worry about self-archiving because access-tolls are hallmarks of capitalism,
              | market economics, supply and demand, free enterprise. Give-aways smack ei-
              | ther of socialism, or market interference, or non-sustainability."
              | This too is merely a superstition. There are plenty of perfectly capitalistic
              | precedents for give-aways, advertising being the most prominent one. If the
              | thought of advertisers curtailing the potential impact of their ads by charging
              | potential customers for access to them makes no sense, then it makes just as
              | little sense to curtail the potential impact of research by charging potential
              | users for access to them.
              | Nor is there any market interference in self-archiving one's own refereed re-
              | search: If institutions and individuals want to pay for toll-access to the on-paper
              | version, or the publisher's PDF, or further options, they can still do so; but there
              | is no longer any need or justification for continuing to hold the essentials (the
              | peer-reviewed draft) hostage to those toll-based options in the PostGutenberg
              | era, any more than there was any need or justification for continuing to hold the
              | essentials of long-distance communication hostage to postal transport costs in
              | the era of telephony. (Rather than capitalism being under assault from self-
              | archiving, trying to prevent researchers from benefiting from this new, more
              | efficient and economical way of disseminating and maximizing the impact of
              | their refereed research smacks of protectionism.)
              | Two variants on the capitalism-worry arise from scepticism about the even-
              | tual transition from providing an toll-based product to the reader-institution to
              | providing a peer-review service to the author-institution. Note that, strictly
              | speaking, it is not even necessary to answer these worries, as this eventual
meta          | 101
text          | transition is hypothetical, whereas freeing the refereed literature now through
              | self-archiving is not; but here are replies anyway:
              | Question 1: "Won't paying directly for the peer-review service lead to in-
              | flated peer-review costs by the most prestigious journals?"
              | Question 2: "Won't peer-review revenues lower standards, so that lower-
              | quality work is accepted in order to get more peer-review revenue?"
              | The answer to both is similar: Referees referee for free, and journal quality
              | and prestige (and impact) depend on rejection rates. Trying to inflate revenue
              | by lowering acceptance thresholds simply lowers quality, thereby favoring the
              | competition, with higher standards. It is a built in counter-weight. Likewise for
              | raising peer-review rates: As referees referee for free, there is no reason one
              | journal should charge more than another, and if they do, they risk driving not
              | only the authors but the unpaid referees to the competition. Because the com-
              | petitive commodity in this anomalous give-away domain is quality, and noth-
              | ing else.
              | A proposal has occasionally been voiced to keep preserve toll-barriers by
              | buying authors off from self-archiving, by offering to share the revenue with
              | them (royalty payments). But the trade-off between imprint-income and im-
              | pact-income is so disproportionate for this anomalous domain that there is not
              | faintly enough money available to make others prefer sacrificing their potential
              | impact in exchange.
              | No rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in worries about capital-
              | ism.
              | 8.15 Readability
              | "I worry about self-archiving because it is inconvenient to read texts on
              | screen, and hard on the eyes. It is also not suitable for bed, beach or bathroom
              | reading."
              | At the moment it is undeniable that for extended, discursive reading, on-
              | paper is still preferable to on-line. This will no doubt change, but even now it is
              | no reason whatsoever for not self-archiving. First, a large proportion of the
              | scientific and scholarly use of the refereed research literature consists of brows-
              | ing and searching, not linear reading, and for this, on-line navigation is already
              | incomparably superior. Second, there is still that vast potential readership to
              | consider, whose access to your research in any form is currently blocked by
              | unaffordable access-tolls (Odlyzko 1999a, 1999b; http://www.arl.org/
              | stats/index.html); for that entire disenfranchised population, it's either online or
              | not at all. And last, even for linear reading, the archived version can always be
              | printed off.

              | than on-paper and require too much storage capacity and transmission time."
              | Graphics too will no doubt improve. With a few exceptions, such as fine arts
              | and histology, digital graphics are already good enough. Users can always

              | Learned Societies are potential allies in and beneficiaries of the self-
              | archiving initiative. First, they are us. Whatever is good for research, and for
              | research impact, is therefore good for Learned Societies.
              | But many of them are also journal publishers, and hence may be facing
              | downsizing pains. Unlike commercial publishers, however, their first and last
              | allegiance will of course be to research and researchers, that is, us. We will
              | hear rationalizations about needing the toll revenues to fund "good works" such
              | as meetings, scholarships and lobbying. But it will quickly become evident
              | that, on the one hand, some of these good works are not essentials either, and
              | certainly nothing that we would want to sacrifice research impact for; and the
              | subset of them that really is essential (such as meetings) will prove to be able to
              | fund itself other ways too, rather than needing to be subsidized at the expense
              | of research impact.
              | Learned Societies (and perhaps also University Presses) are also natural
              | candidates for taking over the serials titles of commercial journal publishers
              | who prefer to discontinue journal operations rather than scale down to just
              | becoming peer-review service providers.

              | plans for their researchers' writings, such as Eprint Archive access-tolls."
              | This worry seems to be based on some (one hopes) over-suspicious views
              | about university administrators and their motives.
              | We should not forget that the give-away refereed literature is esoteric, with
              | virtually no "market" per paper. So whereas there might be a basis for suspi-
              | cion about what our hard-pressed universities might like to do if they could get
              | their hands on our exoteric, non-give-away work (royalty-bearing books and
meta          | 104
text          | textbooks), there's not much they could do to squeeze revenue out of our no-
              | market, give-away refereed research reports even if they wanted to. On the
              | contrary, our universities, like ourselves, benefit far more from the potential
              | impact-income of such work – maximized by removing all access-barriers –
              | than from any potential imprint-income that could be squeezed out of it by co-
              | opting the "P" from the publishers' S/L/P tolls and using it to charge institu-
              | tional archive access-tolls.
              | Moreover, our universities' potential toll savings, and relief from their seri-
              | als crises, are completely dependent on freeing access to our research. Any sign
              | of university-levied archive-access tolls would simply serve to keep the current

              | will become evident that on-screen digital searching and browsing can be every
              | bit as serendipitous as on-paper analog searching and browsing; chance adja-
              | cency effects are every bit as potent either way. The searching and browsing
              | will simply be less exhausting to the limbs and fingers.
              | No rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in worries about loss of
              | serendipity.
              | 8.22 Tenure/Promotion
              | "I worry about self-archiving because it does not count as refereed publica-
              | tion, and might even interfere with the chances for refereed publication."
              | Yet another instance of the archiving/publishing conflation: The self-
              | archiving initiative is aimed at freeing refereed publication from toll-based
              | access/impact barriers (not from refereeing). Unrefereed preprints do not count
              | as publications on-line any more than they do on-paper.
              | The other half of this worry is probably a variant of the Copyright (8.10)
              | concerns (q.v.) as well as concerns about Embargo policies (Harnad 2000a,
              | 2000b), both of which are groundless.
              | No rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in worries about ten-
              | ure/promotion.

              | 9.1 Napster
              | Author-end give-aways of their own digital products via self-archiving is the
              | antithesis of consumer-end rip-offs of others' non-give-away digital products
              | via napster (http://www.napster.com/) or gnutella (http://gnutella.wego.com/).
              | It is very important to clearly distinguish and distance the two, because any
              | inadvertent or willful conflation of the self-archiving initiative with napster can
              | only retard the progress of the self-archiving initiative toward the optimal and
              | inevitable.
              | ("Information is free" is nonsense: There is and always was both give-away
              | and non-give-away information. Steal the latter and you simply kill the incen-
              | tive to provide it in the first place.)
              | 9.2 Peer-review reform
              | Peer review is not without its flaws, but improving peer review first requires
              | careful testing of alternative systems, and demonstrating empirically that these
              | alternatives are at least as effective as classical peer review in maintaining the
              | quality of the refereed literature (such as it is). No alternatives have yet been
              | tested or demonstrated effective.
              | Hence current peer review reform or elimination proposals are merely
              | speculative hypotheses at this time, and red herrings insofar as the freeing of
              | the peer-reviewed literature is concerned: The self-archiving initiative is di-
              | rected at freeing the current peer-reviewed literature, such as it is, from the
              | impact/access barriers of S/L/P access-tolls, now. It is not directed at freeing
              | the literature from peer review, or at testing or implementing untested alterna-
              | tives to peer review (Cf. http://library.caltech.edu/publications/ScholarsForum/
              | 042399sharnad.htm and http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Ebiomed/com
              | 0509.htm#harn45).
              | The benefits of freeing the refereed literature now are a sure thing; the bene-
              | fits (if any) from future alternatives to peer review (if any) are purely hypo-
              | thetical, and certainly nothing to hold as back from self-archiving to wait for.
              | 9.3 "Scholarly skywriting"
              | An additional benefit of at last having the entire refereed literature online and
              | freed of access/impact barriers is that this "skyreading and skywriting," poten-
              | tially accelerating the global collaborative, cumulative, self-corrective cycles of
              | human interaction in research almost to the "speed of thought," will help to

              | 9.4 Embryology of knowledge
              | An online, interoperable, citation-linked refereed research literature also makes
              | it possible to monitor and measure scholarly/scientific practise, progress and
              | impact in powerful new ways that go far beyond mere citation-impact (e.g.
              | download impact, download immediacy, pre-refereeing impact, user naviga-
              | tional route analysis, revision embryology, searching with online au-
              | thor/paper/journal impact ranking, online co-download/co-citation searching,

              | Will the availability of free, interoperable software for creating institution-
              | based Eprint Archives get us to the optimal/inevitable at last? Future historians
              | will have to be the judge (Harnad 1999b). But it is already a historical fact that
              | it is already within reach, and that we have been slow to grasp.
              | APPENDIX A: Eprints.org Software for Creating Institutional
              | and Individual Open Archives
              | At the 2nd Open Archive Initiative (OAI) meeting in San Antonio in June
              | (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june00/06inbrief.html#FOX) a participant said:
              | "Open Archiving will not get off the ground until the day I can go to a web-
              | site, download open-archiving software, then say MAKE ARCHIVE, and an
              | interoperable, OAI-compliant archive is up and running, ready to be filled."
              | At Southampton, we took this to heart, and applying our experience with the
              | CogPrints archive, designed the generic eprints.org software that fits this bill. A
              | public beta version has been released and has taken over operations at the Cog-
              | Prints site (http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/). The operational release (December
              | 2000) is free and will be open sourced (and over 100 prospective users world-
              | wide are already signed up).
              | The eprints.org software is a feature-rich, easily installed, eprint archive sys-
              | tem. It runs right "out of the box" with a comprehensive default setup that
              | should serve most institutions' and individuals' needs as it stands. It has also
              | been designed to make it extensively and flexibly re-configurable for custom-
              | ised needs; almost any aspect of the archive's operation can be adapted to suit a
              | particular requirement.
meta          | 107
text          | The archive supports the OAI protocol, allowing it to interoperate with other
              | open archives and open archive services, and to be readily upgraded to keep up
              | with OAI revisions.
              | This adaptability is achieved by using a modular design methodology. The
              | system is divided into two main components: The core archive component,
              | which provides the functionality required for all open archives, and the site-
              | specific component, providing details about exactly what is stored in the ar-
              | chive, how it is presented and how it may be searched. The system is supplied
              | with a richly featured site-specific component that requires minimal changing
              | to set up a fully working, interoperable open archive. When updated revisions
              | of the software become available, the core archive component can be upgraded,
              | and the site retains its identity and data in the site-specific component.

              | 1. The many aspects of the software that can be configured
              | by an institution include:
              | The types of record that can be stored in the archive, and what metadata
              | fields to hold with each
              | The types of document file (or other data) that can be stored with each
              | record
              | The validation checks that are performed on each incoming record, to
              | minimise administrator effort
              | The choice of which metadata fields are searchable by users
              | The choice of what metadata to present records to the open archives
              | protocol (i.e., specifying how the internal metadata maps to the open
              | archives metadata)
              | Full control over the "look and feel" of the archive (in any language:
              | French translations currently being prepared by Helene Bosc and col-
              | leagues at http://inra.fr/)
              | 2. The software also has the following features:
              | "Out of the box" Open Archives Initiative interoperability
              | Simple but very powerful depositing interface
              | Local browsing and searching features
              | Inter- and intra-linking potential (papers, versions, comments, re-
              | sponses)
              | Moderation buffer for incoming deposits
              | Site maintenance via a WWW interface
              | E-Mail subscription service for users
              | It is simple to add extra functionality to an archive in the site-specific com-
              | ponent of the software. This means that the archive can be used by institutions,
meta          | 108
text          | individuals, journals or any other organisation wishing to interoperate with
