              | Criticism is an important aspect of communication within and between groups, but reactions to
              | criticism of groups have been little studied. Past research has shown that criticism elicits greater
              | sensitivity when made by an outgroup member, compared to an ingroup member. Two
              | experiments were conducted to examine how this intergroup sensitivity effect (ISE) is affected by
              | the context of the criticism. Experiment 1 showed that the ISE occurs in a private context, but
              | disappears when it is clear that the criticism is made to a large public audience. Experiment 2
              | investigated intragroup criticism and manipulated both audience size and audience
              | composition. Results showed that ingroup criticism elicited greater sensitivity and less favorable
              | evaluations of the speaker when made to an outgroup rather than an ingroup audience. The
              | results highlight strategic considerations and tacit protocols governing the criticism of groups.

              | C O M M U N I C AT I O N is central to intergroup
              | relations. Stereotypes are largely reﬁned and
              | propagated through it (Lyons & Kashima, 2003;
              | Maass, 1999; Maass, Salvi, Acruri, & Semin,
              | 1989). Indeed new stereotypes may emerge
              | from communication (Douglas & Sutton, 2003;
              | Higgins & Rholes, 1978). Aspects of intergroup
              | relations such as conﬂict, conﬂict resolution,
              | and negotiation are intrinsically communi-
              | cative. In this paper, we explore some of the
              | strategic considerations surrounding an
              | important communicative aspect of intergroup
              | relations: criticism of groups. Extending recent
              | research on how this criticism is received, we
              | investigate the impact of the communicative
              | context in which criticisms are made.
              | Social identity theory (Tajfel, 1978; Tajfel &
              | Turner, 1979) and self-categorization theory
              | (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell,
              | 1987) state that people’s identity partly derives
              | from their membership in social groups.

              | Similarly, individuals’ self-esteem derives partly
              | from their success in establishing and main-
              | taining a positive distinction between their own
              | group and others’ (Tajfel & Turner, 1986).
              | Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that people
              | will employ a range of strategies to establish
              | and preserve this positive distinction. The
              | welfare of groups themselves, and not just their
              | constituent members, also depends critically on
              | the esteem in which they are held (Van Vugt &
              | Hart, 2004).
              | Explicit criticism of the ingroup is a very
              | direct and potent threat to the image of the
              | group. However, until very recently researchers
              | have largely ignored the important issue of how
              | people respond to criticisms of their group.
              | Theoretically, a key determinant of how group
              | criticism is received ought to be its source:
              | speciﬁcally whether it comes from an ingroup
              | member (i.e. intragroup criticism) or an
              | outgroup member (i.e. intergroup criticism).
              | Intragroup criticism, although painful, helps
              | the group to identify and rectify its weaknesses,
              | facilitating growth, change, and improvement
              | (see also Nemeth & Owens, 1996). This kind of
              | communication is analogous to intrapsychic
              | processes such as considered reflection and
              | self-criticism (Carver & Scheier, 1999; Kurman,
              | 2003). Subjecting one’s group to reasonable
              | criticism therefore may be a valuable means of
              | furthering its interests. In kind, fellow ingroup
              | members may be willing to entertain intra-
              | group criticisms, regarding them as probably
              | well-informed and well-intentioned. On the
              | other hand, criticism from an outgroup
              | member is more likely to be seen as a malicious
              | attack, perhaps aimed at bolstering the
              | outgroup’s relative status, and as such is likely
              | to arouse hostility (e.g. Bourhis, Giles, Leyens,
              | & Tajfel, 1979; Grant, 1992).
              | There are other grounds to expect that
              | ingroup criticisms will be preferred to outgroup
              | criticisms. For example, leaders who are more
              | prototypical of their group find it easier to
              | achieve influence over their fellow group
              | members, as they are seen to have their group’s
              | interests at heart (Hogg & van Knippenberg,
              | 2003). By analogy, ingroup members also tend
              | to be more prototypical of the group than
meta          | 232
text          | outgroup members. Also, when evaluating
              | persuasive messages (Eagly, Wood, & Chaiken,
              | 1978; Wood & Eagly, 1981) and attempts at
              | ingratiation (Vonk, 1998, 2002), observers are
              | strongly affected by what they perceive to be the
              | target person’s motives. Indeed these ﬁndings
              | are consistent with contemporary theories of
              | communication in which the perception of
              | speakers’ motives is crucial for successful com-
              | prehension and evaluation of their messages
              | (Albright, Cohen, Malloy, Christ, & Bromgard,
              | 2004; Douglas & Sutton, 2004; Higgins, 1981).
              | Hornsey, Oppes, and Svensson (2002) con-
              | ducted the ﬁrst empirical investigation of these
              | issues. They presented criticisms of ingroups
              | (Australians, students), manipulating the
              | source to which those criticisms were attributed
              | —speciﬁcally, an ingroup member (i.e. intra-
              | group criticism) or an outgroup member (i.e.
              | intergroup criticism). Hornsey et al. found that
              | intragroup criticisms were tolerated rather gra-
              | ciously; indeed ingroup speakers were judged
              | as favorably when they criticized the group as
              | when they praised it. However, whereas
              | speakers who praised the ingroup were rated
              | equally as favorably whether or not they
              | belonged to the group, outgroup critics were
              | judged more harshly than their ingroup equiv-
              | alents. In short, criticisms were welcomed when
              | made by ingroup members but met with sensi-
              | tivity and defensiveness when made by
              | outgroup members. Hornsey et al. (2002)
              | found this intergroup sensitivity effect (ISE)
              | (p. 299) to be mediated by perceptions that
              | intragroup criticism is better informed and
              | intentioned than intergroup criticism.
              | These ﬁndings were mirrored by those pub-
              | lished more or less simultaneously by O’Dwyer,
              | Berkowitz, and Alfeld-Johnson (2002). These
              | revealed greater hostility towards the critic,
              | higher levels of anger, and less agreement with
              | the criticism when the critic was a member of
              | the outgroup rather than an ingroup member.
              | Subsequently Hornsey, Trembath and Gun-
              | thorpe (2004) have shown that criticisms are
              | only welcomed from ingroup members who are
              | highly identiﬁed with or committed to their
              | group. This result underscores the importance
              | of the motives that are perceived to underlie
              | 03 Elder (bc-s) 27/6/05 1:47 pm Page 233
              | criticisms. Similarly, Hornsey and Imani (2004)
              | found that outgroup critics were not tolerated
              | even when they were as knowledgeable about
              | the group as ingroup members, suggesting that
              | motives and not experience are strongly pre-
              | dictive of sensitivity.
              | The importance of the context of
              | communication
              | Although internal criticism can be a valuable
              | aspect of group functioning, it carries with it
              | certain risks. Hornsey et al. (2002) suggest that
              | ‘ingroup criticism will be tolerated to the extent
              | that it is not making the group vulnerable to
              | attack from other groups’ (p. 305). This
              | suggests that if ingroup criticism is perceived to
              | make the group susceptible to outgroup dero-
              | gation, then it could evoke as much sensitivity
              | as outgroup criticism. Such an instance might
              | occur when the criticism appears in public to a
              | large audience. The criticism is then available
              | not only to ingroup members, who might make
              | constructive use of it, but is also available to
              | members of other groups whose impression of
              | the ingroup may be adversely affected, and who
              | may use the comments to their advantage.
              | This distinction between public and private
              | communication has generated considerable
              | research in the domain of individuals’ presen-
              | tations of themselves (e.g. Schlenker & Wowra,
              | 2003; Sedikides, Herbst, Hardin, & Dardis,
              | 2002; Tice, 1992). This research has shown that
              | individuals are acutely aware of the strategic
              | implications of communicating publicly as
              | opposed to privately, and adjust their self-
              | presentations accordingly (e.g. Baumeister,
              | 1982; Schlenker, 1980). For instance, indi-
              | viduals consider the group membership of the
              | audience before expressing prejudiced views or
              | opinions (Crandall, Eshelman, & O’Brien,
              | 2002; Klein, Licata, Azzi, & Durala, 2003). Fur-
              | thermore, Tetlock (1981) showed that partici-
              | pants’ public attributions for their actions
              | seemed tailor-made to create favorable impres-
              | sions in others. In the group domain, group
              | members represented themselves as less
              | important than their colleagues in causing the
              | group to succeed while privately they believed
              | Elder et al. audiences of group criticism
              | themselves to be just as important (Miller &
              | Schlenker, 1985).
              | Recent research suggests that as well as
              | managing impressions of themselves, people
              | manage impressions of their group, responding
              | to the communicative context in doing so
              | (Douglas & McGarty, 2001; Lambert, Cronen,
              | Chasteen, & Lickel, 1996; Reicher, Spears, &
              | Postmes, 1995). One reason for this might be
              | that people are aware of the representations of
              | their group held by relevant outgroups; namely
              | ‘meta-stereotypes’ (Vorauer, Main, & O’Con-
              | nell, 1998, p. 917). Individuals have a vested
              | interest in these ‘meta-stereotypes’, because if
              | they are negative, they threaten one’s valued
              | social identity, self-esteem, and the material
              | interests of the group. Individuals may also ﬁnd
              | it harder to create and maintain a positive
              | public presentation of themselves when they
              | are a member of a devalued group (Cialdini &
              | Richardson, 1981; Eidelman & Biernat, 2003).
              | Consistent with these concerns, Klein and Azzi
              | (2001) found that when meta-stereotypes were
              | salient and when individuals thought that their
              | responses would be available to outgroup
              | members, they selected more positive traits and
              | fewer negative traits as descriptors of the
              | ingroup.
              | These ﬁndings raise an interesting and thus
              | far unanswered question. Given the collective
              | interest of members in the image of the group,
              | does the tendency to present one’s group
              | favorably in public settings take on something
              | of the status of a prescriptive norm? That is, do
              | people react adversely to criticism of their
              | group by fellow group members when it occurs
              | publicly? In sociological ﬁeld studies of groups
              | such as hotel workers, Goffman (1959) noted a
              | norm of refraining from criticizing each other
              | in front of outgroup audiences such as hotel
              | guests. He attributed this to a collective desire
              | to cooperate in a dramaturgical presentation of
              | the group to outsiders. According to Goffman,
              | when intragroup criticisms were made publicly,
              | one effect was ‘to provide the audience with a
              | back-stage view’, and another was ‘to leave the
              | feeling that something is surely suspicious
              | about a performance when those who know
              | best do not agree’ (p. 185).

              | of the message (public/private) in a single,
              | between-groups design.1 We reasoned that indi-
              | viduals may tolerate or even value intragroup
              | criticism when it is not available to outsiders,
              | but may resent it when the image of the group
              | is potentially harmed by public criticism. Thus
              | we expect that the ISE will occur for criticisms
              | made in private but not in public contexts.
              | Method
              | Participants and design Participants were 203
              | undergraduate students recruited on Keele
              | University campus while at leisure (64 males,
              | 139 females, M = 19.09 years of age, SD = 1.42).
              | The experiment consisted of a 2 (source:
              | ingroup/outgroup) 2 (context: private/
              | public) between-groups design. Participants
              | were randomly assigned to conditions.
              | Analogously in social psychology, we have
              | indirect evidence that by refraining from
              | endorsing negative stereotypes before
              | outgroup audiences, people exhibit at least a
              | tacit awareness that their words and deeds will
              | affect the image of their group (cf. Klein &
              | Azzi, 2001). They are likely to perceive that
              | public criticism adversely affects the valued
              | meta-stereotype (Vorauer et al., 1998). There-
              | fore when people publicly criticize their group,
              | fellow ingroup members may respond harshly.
              | In the present research, we examine the
              | importance of the context of communication in
              | shaping reactions to intragroup and intergroup
              | criticisms. To date, no research has addressed
              | this issue; manipulations have addressed the
              | group membership of the speaker (Hornsey
              | et al., 2002), the extent to which the speaker
              | identiﬁes with the group (Hornsey et al., 2004),
              | and the extent to which the speaker has
              | personal experience of the group (Hornsey &
              | Imani, 2004). In these studies by Hornsey and
              | colleagues, the context of criticisms has been
              | ambiguous, described as taking place in an
              | interview, but where the audience privy to the
              | interview was not made explicit. In the study by
              | O’Dwyer et al. (2002), stimulus criticisms had
              | allegedly been published in the critic’s school
              | newspaper. This meant that the criticisms were
              | made publicly but to an inclusive ingroup
              | audience (relative to the critic). Although the
              | only intended manipulation was the source of
              | the criticism, the audience differed across
              | conditions as well. The current research aims to
              | systematically examine the role of context in
              | moderating reactions to criticism from ingroup
              | and outgroup members. Specifically, Experi-
              | ment 1 manipulates the context of the
              | audience (criticism appears in private versus
              | public domains) and the source of the criticism
              | (ingroup or outgroup member). Experiment 2
              | breaks down the context of the criticism by
              | separating the size of the audience and the
              | composition of the audience.
              | Materials and procedure As in Hornsey and
              | colleagues’ research (2002), participants were
              | informed that the study was designed to
              | examine people’s perceptions of personality
              | types. On the ﬁrst page participants received
              | identical instructions in all four conditions,
              | except for one line that was speciﬁc for the con-
              | dition assigned, which read ‘these comments
              | were spoken by an undergraduate [someone
              | who didn’t go to university], in a private
              | conversation [and appeared in a national
              | newspaper]’.
              | The ﬁrst line of the second page outlined
              | the group membership of the critic and the
              | context in which the comments were spoken.
              | For example, for the ingroup private condition
              | participants read: ‘David Sanderson is a
              | 20-year-old second year undergraduate student
              | [ofﬁce manager who decided against going to
              | university]. In a private conversation [in a
              | national newspaper], he made these comments
              | about students’ (alternative wording for
              | outgroup critic and public context appears in
              | parentheses).
              | Participants were then presented with
              | comments attributed to the speaker which were
              | Experiment 1 based on negative press comments from the
              | media concerning students’ activities while at
              | Here we manipulate both the source of the university. This criticism was used because of
              | message (ingroup/outgroup) and the context the likelihood that it would tap a salient and

              | commonly held stereotype. Comments from
              | the ingroup member were presented as coming
              | from a 20-year-old undergraduate student
              | called David Sanderson, who said:
              | ‘Most of us are from privileged, middle-class back-
              | grounds, but we expect the taxpayer to support us.
              | Many of us just drift into university because of
              | parental pressure or simply because we want to get
              | drunk and party. About 50% of students show up
              | to the average lecture and seminar; much of the
              | absenteeism is down to the fact that we’re either
              | spending our time and money in the pub, or we’re
              | hungover from the night before.’
              | Speaking about the current controversy on fees,
              | Mr Sanderson said, ‘I strongly support top-up fees.
              | We beneﬁt from our education, and so should pay
              | for it. If fees were increased only those who are
              | really serious about their studies would go to uni-
              | versity. The universities would also be able to put
              | on better classes’.
              | For the outgroup condition David Sanderson
              | used third-person pronouns (‘them’ and
              | ‘they’) instead of ﬁrst-person pronouns (‘us’
              | and ‘we’). The outgroup critic was allocated the
              | status of ofﬁce manager in order to try and
              | match his status with that of a university
              | student. If his title would have been office
              | worker or ofﬁce cleaner then ingroup members
              | may perceive the comments as ‘sour grapes’
              | because his position in society is lower than
              | what they would hope to achieve, making his
              | criticism easier to dismiss.
              | Once participants read the comments, they
              | were presented with Hornsey et al.’s (2002)
              | sensitivity scale. Participants were asked ‘to
              | what extent do you think the comments were’:
              | (followed by the words) ‘threatening’, ‘dis-
              | appointing’, ‘irritating’, ‘offensive’, ‘insulting’,
              | ‘hypocritical’, ‘judgmental’ and ‘arrogant’.
              | Participants responded on a Likert scale (1 =
              | not at all, 7 = very much). The sensitivity scale was
              | reliable = .82.
              | In addition we also measured the anger felt
              | by the participants after reading the comments,
              | using the four-item scale by O’Dwyer et al.
              | (2002), for example: ‘How annoyed do you feel
              | after reading these comments?’ ( = .88). A
              | single item was also included to assess partici-
              | pants’ agreement with the speaker’s comments.
              | This was measured by asking: ‘how much do
              | Elder et al. audiences of group criticism
              | you agree with the comments?’ (Hornsey et al.,
              | 2002).
              | Questions were then asked to tap into par-
              | ticipants’ perceptions of the speaker. These
              | questions related to the morality of the critic,
              | the critic’s motive, competency of the critic, and
              | the effect of the critic’s comments. Morality was
              | measured because it may be possible that par-
              | ticipants believe that by going public with criti-
              | cism of their ingroup the speaker is breaking
              | some form of moral code. The morality items
              | were: ‘the speaker should make comments like
              | these’, ‘it was wrong of the speaker to make
              | these comments’ (reverse coded), and ‘by
              | making these comments the speaker was doing
              | the right thing’ ( = .68). Motive was assessed
              | because when an ingroup member criticizes
              | their group publicly their intentions may be seen
              | as less honorable. Motive was measured using
              | the following four questions: ‘this speaker had
              | students’ interests at heart’, ‘this speaker’s
              | intentions were honorable’, ‘this speaker’s
              | comments were intended to beneﬁt students’
              | and ‘this speaker was trying to be constructive’
              | ( = .75). Competency was included because
              | previous research has shown critics’ group
              | membership to affect perceptions of how quali-
              | ﬁed they are to comment on the group. Com-
              | petency was measured with the following items:
              | ‘the speaker’s comments were well-informed’,
              | ‘the speaker was qualified to make these
              | comments’ and ‘this speaker has enough
              | experience of students to make these
              | comments’ ( = .80). The ﬁrst two items were
              | adapted from Hornsey et al.’s legitimacy scale.
              | The ﬁnal scale was included to measure the
              | perceived effect of the comments, given that
              | public criticism could be perceived as having a
              | more negative effect on the group than private
              | criticism. The effect items were: ‘this speaker’s
              | comments will positively affect students’ image’,
              | ‘this speaker’s comments will have a positive
              | impact on university education’, and ‘this
              | speaker’s comments will beneﬁt students’ ( =
              | .69). These scales appeared together, in
              | random order, and participants responded on a
              | Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly
              | agree). Once participants completed these
              | questions they were thanked and debriefed.

              | Results and discussion
              | Preliminary analyses To verify that our depen-
              | dent measures assessed separate constructs, and
              | to identify any problematic cross-mappings, we
              | subjected our measures to factor analyses. To
              | verify that sensitivity (Hornsey et al., 2002) and
              | anger (O’Dwyer et al., 2002) are different con-
              | structs, we entered all items from both scales
              | into a factor analysis. As these two constructs
              | were interrelated (r = .516), we used oblique
              | rotation. This produced a two-factor solution,
              | with the ﬁrst factor comprising the anger items
              | (eigenvalue = 5.05, 42.10% of the variance
              | explained) and the second factor including the
              | sensitivity items (eigenvalue = 1.65, 13.75% of
              | the variance explained). Therefore, these scales
              | were treated as separate constructs.
              | A similar analysis was used to determine
              | whether motive, effect, competency, and
              | morality scales assessed the intended con-
              | structs. Once more oblique rotation was used
              | given that these constructs tended to be inter-
              | related (r = .003 to .517 with the average corre-
              | lation approximately .30). This revealed a
              | three-factor solution, with the ﬁrst factor com-
              | prising the motive and effect items (eigenvalue
              | = 4.30, 33.09% of the variance explained) and
              | the second factor the competency items (eigen-
              | value = 1.91, 14.72% of the variance explained).
              | Because both effect and motive loaded on the
              | same factor, we combined these scales into a
              | single scale we labelled consequences. This new
              | scale combined the effect of the comments as
              | estimated by the participants and as perceived
              | to be intended by the speaker ( = .80). This
              | close correspondence in motives and effect
              | suggests that participants believe the speaker to
              | have intended or at least to have been aware of
              | the likely effect of his or her comments. The
              | third factor comprised the morality items
              | (eigenvalue = 1.30, 9.29% of the variance
              | explained). We therefore analyzed results for
              | consequences, competency, and morality.
              | Main effects and interactions for evaluations of
              | the comments Results were entered into a 2

              | In many instances the communicative
              | context and the composition of the audience
              | are naturally confounded. Private comments
              | are often accessible only to ingroup members,
              | whereas comments made publicly tend to be
              | accessible to people from different groups.
              | However context and composition are concep-
              | tually separable, and are separable in practice
              | too. Given that we tend to belong to a multi-
              | tude of social groups, it is probably quite
              | common for people to talk about their own
              | group, in private, to outgroup members. To
              | illustrate, it is quite likely that students talk
              | about other students when at home with their
              | families. Further, some communicative settings
              | are importantly public, but at the same time
              | unlikely to be scrutinized by outgroup
              | members. For example, internet sites for
              | special interest groups are available to the
              | public but not likely to be regularly inhabited
              | by outgroup members. Comments made in
              | such contexts are public but may well ﬁnd a
              | purely ingroup audience. So public communi-
              | cation does not always entail intergroup com-
              | munication, even if public communication
              | entails the possibility that outgroup members
              | will receive the message.
              | It is the aim of this experiment to tease apart
              | the variables of audience size and composition,
              | which are somewhat confounded in the ﬁrst
              | experiment. Therefore, it manipulates both the
              | size of the audience (context is public or
              | private) and composition of the audience
              | (audience consists of ingroup or outgroup
              | members), in a fully between-groups design. As
              | there was no effect of context for the outgroup
              | critic in the ﬁrst experiment, all criticism in the
              | next experiment will be presented as intra-
              | group criticism.
              | There are also other methodological changes
              | in this experiment. In both the pilot study1 and
              | the first experiment the critic advocated
              | increased tuition fees as part of their criticism
              | of students. This issue of ‘top-up’ fees was par-
              | ticularly topical at the time and helped to con-
              | textualize the criticism. However, we were
              | concerned that this suggested implementation
              | of a policy that would hurt students’ interests
              | could be responsible for increased sensitivity in
meta          | 238
text          | public contexts. Therefore, the current experi-
              | ment manipulated whether or not the
              | comments about top-up fees were included in
              | the criticisms. We also included an additional
              | scale by Hornsey et al. (2002) to examine
              | whether perceptions of the speaker’s personal-
              | ity would differ depending on the context of
              | the criticism.
              | Method
              | Participants and design Participants were 200
              | undergraduate students (70 male, 130 female,
              | M = 19.80 years of age, SD = 3.31). Of these, 100
              | were psychology students who participated to
              | fulfill course credits and the remainder
              | recruited on Keele University campus while at
              | leisure. The experiment consisted of a 2
              | (audience composition: ingroup/outgroup)
              | 2 (audience size: small/large) between-subjects
              | design. Participants were randomly assigned to
              | the four conditions.
              | Materials and procedure Participants received
              | identical instructions in all conditions except
              | those speciﬁc to the condition assigned. For
              | example, in the large ingroup audience con-
              | dition it stated that: ‘These comments were spoken
              | by an undergraduate student interviewed on student
              | radio [Radio 2] where less than 1% of listeners are
              | non-students [students]’. Alternatively, for the
              | smaller ingroup audience condition the
              | instructions were: ‘These comments were spoken by
              | an undergraduate student, in a private conversation
              | with only other students [non-students] present’.
              | Participants then turned the page and were
              | informed of the audience size and composition.
              | For example, in the small audience condition
              | participants were informed that: ‘Whilst in a
              | private conversation in his halls of residence with only
              | other students present [with his family and friends
              | who are not students], he made these comments about
              | students’. In the large audience condition this
              | read: ‘Whilst being interviewed on student radio
              | [Radio 2], he made these comments about students’.
              | Participants then proceeded to read the same
              | negative script about students as in Experiment
              | 1, except that for half the participants, the com-
              | mentary concerning top-up fees was deleted
              | from the criticism. Measures were also identical

              | to Experiment 1 except for the inclusion of
              | Hornsey et al.’s (2002) personality evaluation
              | scale. This asked ‘to what extent do you think
              | the speaker is’: (followed by the words) ‘intelli-
              | gent’, ‘trustworthy’, ‘friendly’, ‘open-minded’,
              | ‘likeable’, ‘nice’, ‘respected’, and ‘interesting’
              | ( = .88). Participants completed the same
              | sensitivity ( = .90), anger ( = .96), motives
              | ( = .77), morality ( = .70), competency ( =
              | .78), and effect ( = .66) scales, as well as the
              | agreement item.
              | Results and discussion
              | Preliminary analyses Initial factor analyses
              | also replicated the factor structures observed
              | for Experiment 1 and showed Hornsey et al.’s
              | (2002) personality evaluation scale to be
              | distinct from other measures. In order to rule
              | out the possibility that commentary concerning
              | top-up fees in the script was altering reactions
              | to the criticism, we also conducted initial
              | ANOVAs including this factor (top-up fees:
              | included/excluded). For sensitivity, there was
              | no main effect of top-up fees (F(1, 192) = 3.29,
              | Elder et al.
              | audiences of group criticism
              | p = .079), nor crucially any interaction with
              | audience composition (F(1, 192) = .73, p = .39);
              | or audience size (F(1, 192) = .11, p = .74); and
              | no three-way interaction between top-up fees,
              | audience composition, and size (F(1, 192) =
              | .001, p = .98). Similarly, for personality evalu-
              | ations, there was no main effect of top-up fees
              | (F(1, 192) = .10, p = .75), nor any interaction
              | with audience composition (F(1, 192) = 1.42,
              | p = .24); or audience size (F(1, 192) = .002,
              | p = .96); and no three-way interaction between
              | top-up fees, audience composition, and size
              | (F(1, 192) = 2.02, p = .16). Therefore, top-up
              | fees as a variable was dropped from further
              | analyses.
              | Main effects and interactions for evaluation of
              | the comments Results were then analyzed

              | sensitive to criticism of their group when there
              | was an outgroup audience (M = 4.67) than
              | when there was an ingroup audience (M = 4.32)
              | (p = .040, 2 = .022). Ingroup members do not
              | want the group’s shortcomings to be heard by
              | outsiders. However, for sensitivity there was no
              | main effect of audience size. This suggests that
              | the composition of the audience, and not its
              | size, affects sensitivity. The results also show, as
              | in Experiment 1, sensitivity is greatest when the
              | outgroup critic speaks to a small outgroup
              | audience, perhaps because ingroup members
              | are not able to respond to the criticism.
              | Participants were also more angered by
              | the critic’s comments when they were spoken
              | to the outgroup audience (M = 4.04) than to
              | the ingroup audience (M = 3.54) (p = .039,
              | 2 = .022). For agreement, there were no main
              | effects or interactions for audience composi-
              | tion and audience size. Thus, although the
              | source of otherwise identical messages affects
              | agreement (Experiment 1; also see Hornsey
              | et al., 2002), characteristics of the perceived
              | audience do not. Clearly, source and context
              | have different effects on evaluative reactions to
              | comments.
              | Main effects and interactions for evaluations
              | of the speaker As suggested by our factor
              | analyses, motive and effect were combined into
              | a single scale we labeled consequences ( = .83).
              | For consequences of the criticism, there was a
              | main effect of audience composition, with
              | more positive consequences perceived when
              | the speaker addressed an ingroup audience
              | (M = 3.03) compared with an outgroup
              | audience (M = 2.71) (p = .018, 2 = .029). In
              | addition, when the critic spoke to the ingroup
              | audience he was perceived as more moral (M =
              | 4.07) than when he spoke to the outgroup
              | audience (M = 3.82), although this effect was
              | marginal (p = .09, 2 = .014). For morality there
              | was also a main effect of audience size with
              | participants perceiving the speaker as possess-
              | ing greater morality when speaking to a small
              | audience (M = 4.38) than when speaking to a
              | large audience (M = 3.52) (p = .001, 2 = .140).
              | This supports the suggestion that the moral rules
              | or norms governing intragroup communication
meta          | 240
text          | are dependent on the social context in which
              | the comments are expressed. If the speaker
              | goes ‘on the record’ and speaks to a large
              | audience then they may no longer be perceived
              | as doing what is right for the group. The
              | ingroup speaker was also perceived as more
              | competent when criticizing the group to an
              | ingroup audience (M = 3.74) than to an
              | outgroup audience (M = 3.30) (p = .011, 2 =
              | .033). This suggests that although the criticisms
              | presented were identical, the speaker was per-
              | ceived as having greater experience and qualiﬁ-
              | cations to make these negative comments about
              | their own group when they kept the criticism
              | ‘in house’. As predicted, there was a signiﬁcant
              | main effect of audience for ratings of personal-
              | ity evaluations. Finally, participants evaluated
              | the ingroup critic’s personality more favorably
              | when he criticized the group before ingroup
              | members (M = 3.69) rather than outgroup
              | members (M = 3.37) (p = .015, 2 = .030). Again,
              | this is consistent with our rationale that partici-
              | pants will not perceive the speaker favorably
              | when the criticism is taken beyond the conﬁnes
              | of the ingroup.
              | General discussion
              | The current research is the ﬁrst to assess the
              | impact of communicative context on reactions
              | to intergroup and intragroup criticism. Our
              | ﬁrst experiment manipulated both the source
              | of the criticism (ingroup versus outgroup
              | speaker) and the context of the criticism
              | (public versus private) and showed that the ISE
              | only occurred when criticisms were made in
              | private. When the comments appeared in
              | public they were no more welcomed from an
              | ingroup member than from an outgroup
              | member. The second experiment aimed to
              | clarify whether the preference for private
              | ingroup criticism was due to the smaller size of
              | the audience or the fact that it was composed
              | of ingroup rather than outgroup members. The
              | ﬁndings demonstrated that increased sensitivity
              | and derogation of the speaker was associated
              | with taking the criticism to outsiders. There-
              | fore, it seems that an ingroup critic speaking
              | to an ingroup audience is seen as ‘clearing the
              | 03 Elder (bc-s) 27/6/05 1:47 pm Page 241
              | air’ by highlighting the group’s weaknesses,
              | thereby promoting growth and improvement
              | (see Nemeth & Owens, 1996), but when
              | speaking to an outgroup audience, he or she
              | is perceived to be ‘airing the group’s dirty
              | laundry’.
              | Our replication of the ISE supports theoreti-
              | cal claims that there are norms governing inter-
              | group criticism (Hornsey et al., 2002; see also
              | Franco & Maass, 1996). Our demonstration
              | that this effect disappears in public, where
              | ingroup critics are less well received, suggests
              | that there are also norms governing intragroup
              | criticism. The norms governing each kind of
              | criticism appear to be somewhat different;
              | while reactions to intergroup criticism were not
              | greatly affected by the context in which it
              | appeared, participants were clearly more
              | piqued by intragroup criticism that could reach
              | an outgroup audience. Indeed, intragroup criti-
              | cism was judged to be less moral when made in
              | public, showing that people are perceived to be
              | less entitled to criticize their group in public
              | than in private. Furthermore, intragroup criti-
              | cism before an outgroup audience was per-
              | ceived as having more negative consequences
              | and the speaker was judged to be less compe-
              | tent than when the criticism was made to an
              | ingroup audience.
              | These ﬁndings are consistent with a norma-
              | tive expectation that group members should
              | collaborate to foster a desired public image of
              | their group (Goffman, 1959; Klein & Azzi,
              | 2001). Criticizing one’s own group in public
              | may affirm negative meta-stereotypes to the
              | detriment of the group (Vorauer et al., 1998).
              | These ﬁndings also suggest that when people
              | speak to outgroup members about their
              | ingroup’s weaknesses, this can change our per-
              | ceptions of the speaker’s motivations and per-
              | sonality. In this context we no longer see them
              | as well-intentioned and well-informed.
              | The effects of context and source on
              | reactions to criticism found in the present
              | experiments demonstrate the impact of speciﬁ-
              | cally communicative variables on reactions to
              | group criticism. For example, people’s toler-
              | ance of criticism may differ depending on
              | whether the critic is identiﬁable. Identiﬁability
              | Elder et al. audiences of group criticism
              | has a range of implications for how ingroup
              | and outgroup members are perceived and
              | treated. Intuitively, one might expect greater
              | tolerance of identiﬁable critics on the grounds
              | that they are prepared to be accountable for
              | their comments, but in fact this may interact
              | with source and context (Douglas & McGarty,
              | 2001; Reicher & Levine, 1994a, 1994b; Reicher
              | et al., 1995).
              | Another potential moderating variable is the
              | status of the outgroup speaker. In Experiment
              | 1 we described the ingroup critic as a 20-year-
              | old undergraduate student and the outgroup
              | critic as a 20-year-old office manager who
              | decided against going to university. The aim
              | was to try and match the two critics in terms of
              | both age and status. However, recent research
              | suggests that speakers’ perceived status can
              | moderate the ISE (Tarrant, 2005). We therefore
              | acknowledge that it may have been advan-
              | tageous in the ﬁrst experiment to use multiple
              | outgroup speakers of different status random-
              | ized across conditions.
              | To conclude, the present ﬁndings show that
              | reactions to intragroup and intergroup criti-
              | cism depend importantly on the context in
              | which criticism appears. Criticisms seem to be
              | preferred from ingroup members rather than
              | outgroup members, but not when taken into
              | the intergroup domain. This preference strikes
              | us as being, to a large degree, rational; making
              | criticisms of one’s group in public contexts
              | where they are available to outgroup members
              | would indeed appear to put the group’s image
              | at risk, with little beneﬁt to the ingroup relative
              | to more discreet forms of communication. Our
              | results point to a rather subtle set of norms
              | governing the criticism of groups, and high-
              | light the interaction between communicative
              | factors such as source and context. In doing so,
              | they underscore the essentially communicative
              | nature of group processes and intergroup
              | relations.

              | speciﬁed. The purpose of this was to ensure that
              | our different intergroup and national context
              | produced the same results as in the original ISE
              | studies. Participants were 84 undergraduate
              | students at Keele University (26 male, 58 female,
              | M = 19.27 years of age, SD = 1.95). Results were
              | analyzed as a two-group between-subjects design
              | (source: ingroup/outgroup critic). As predicted,
              | criticisms from an outgroup member resulted in
              | greater sensitivity (M = 4.87) than when the same
              | comments were made by an ingroup member
              | (M = 4.34) (F(1, 82) = 4.76, p = .032, 2 = .06).
              | This result shows that the present materials
              | produce an ISE in ambiguous communicative
              | contexts as found by Hornsey et al. (2002).
