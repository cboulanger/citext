              | Abstract
              | The paper analyzes the radical right‘s attitudes toward the EU focusing in particular on the
              | level of congruence between the programmatic statements of the central office and the
              | voting behavior of their MEPs. It shows that although radical right parties represent a source
              | of opposition to the EU, within the EP they express their dissent making use of the rules of
              | the game, voting with the opposition more than the other forces do, but voting almost as
              | much with the majority. The party public office in the EP is inserted in the legislative process
              | and even more collusive with the other parties of both sides of the political spectrum than the
              | Eurosceptical rhetoric and statements of central office makes the public believe.

              | Introduction
              | Many studies show that Euroscepticism has become an ideological pillar of radical right
              | parties. It is a theme that has acquired greater salience within the political discourse of this
              | area, to the point that these parties have become the main stronghold of EU-pessimism
              | (Mudde 2007). Particularly, their political discourse has largely internalized the EU issue,
              | making the radical right the political area where this issue has become more salient (Kriesi
              | 2007). In this paper, I analyze the radical right‘s attitudes toward the EU focusing in particular
              | on the level of congruence between the programmatic statements and the voting behavior of
              | their MEPs. Notably, the aim of the paper is to describe the problem along the following
              | lines:
              | 1) an analysis of the level of congruence of party positions within the programmatic
              | supply of these parties, as well as within the voting behavior of their MEPs;
              | 2) an analysis of the level of congruence between the political discourse of the party
              | central office and the voting behavior of the party in public office.
              | It is an approach that aims at integrating several dimensions of party attitudes toward the EU
              | examined by earlier studies, such as the dimension of the political discourse that was
              | examined through the party manifestos for the European elections (Gabel & Hix 2004), and
              | of the institutional behavior of politicians that was examined through the voting behavior of
              | MEPs (Hix et al. 2007). In sum, through the analysis of party Euromanifestos and roll-call
              | votes in the European Parliament, I will produce a description of what radical right parties
              | say about Europe, what their MEPs do in order to translate the party rhetoric into concrete
              | political action, and how congruent these two dimensions of the party stance on the EU are.
              | From the theoretical point of view, the paper will contribute to understanding politics and the
              | behavior of the radical right in different ways. Firstly, the results of the comparative analysis
              | will allow us to determine whether the radical right behaves cohesively enough to present the
              | character of a real party family. Or, alternatively, it will determine whether the empirical
              | evidence supports the argument – maintained by the founder of the German Republicans
              | Franz Schönhuber among others (in Mudde 2007: 159) – that a genuine European radical
              | right does not really exist.
              | Secondly, assessing the level of congruence between the attitudes of different faces of party
              | organization is a relevant problem that current research has just started to address (Conti, Cotta &
              | Tavares de Almeida 2010). Particularly, assessing the extent to which the official party stance on the
              | EU overlaps with that of party officials holding public office is meaningful for a comprehensive
              | understanding of the broad phenomenon of party attitudes toward the EU. Recent research shows that
              | citizens are way less pro-European than politicians (Best, Lengyel & Verzichelli forthcoming). Given the
              | gap in the support for the EU between citizens and politicians, it is particularly relevant to study
              | 2 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H S
              | whether the party central office pools together with the party in public office or whether it takes more
              | cautious positions. In other words, does the stance of the MEPs within the European Parliament (EP)
              | reflect the party discourse on the EU developed for usage in the electoral market? The comparison
              | between the attitudes of the party central office and those of the MEPs presented in this paper will
              | allow us to answer this question.

              | What the
              | Radical
              | In order to analyze the attitudes of radical right parties toward the EU and to describe the
              | main components of these attitudes (dissatisfaction with the defense of national interests,
              | opposition to EU policies, protest against loss of sovereignty) I will examine the party
              | positions on a set of specific issues. I will start my analysis with a study of party
              | Euromanifestos, the programs that the national parties present for the EP elections. These
              | documents provide a useful representation of the ideological structure and of the policy
              | preferences of parties. Radical parties tend to have a particularly good electoral performance
              | at the EP elections given the second-order nature of the scrutiny, and thanks to the PR
              | nature of the electoral system. Their visibility in these elections tends to be high and their
              | programmatic assertiveness is consequently also high. It is important to note that
              | Euromanifestos are usually issued by the party central office and they present the overall
              | party line for use with the party rank and file and with the electorate. Thus, these documents
              | reflect a unitary vision of the party and do not offer much evidence of any eventual intra-party
              | division. This limitation that is intrinsic to any manifesto analysis is also the starting point for
              | an interesting research question: Is a party cohesive enough in its stance on the EU? As was
              | mentioned in the introduction, this paper begins to address the problem by means of a
              | comparison between the analysis of party manifestos that I present in this section, and that
              | of the voting behavior of the MEPs in the following section.
              | Given the level of complexity and the increasing number of policy areas where the EU is involved, it
              | seems useful to break-down party attitudes across many aspects of European integration. This attempt
              | allows for a disentanglement of party attitudes across different dimensions of the EU process and a
              | determination whether the same stance is confirmed across such dimensions. For this purpose, I will
              | focus the analysis in particular on the dimensions of representation and policy. It is a research strategy
              | that aims at including several functional aspects of supranational integration in the analysis. In the
              | recent past, the theoretical debate (Bartolini 2007; Benhabib 2002; Cotta e Isernia 2009) as well as
              | some empirical studies (Conti & Memoli 2010; Hooghe, Marks & Wilson 2004; Hubé & Rambour 2010;
              | Gabel & Hix 2004) have defined these dimensions as relevant for the analysis of the EU impact on
              | member states and of the response of political actors to such an impact.

              | The data base used for this part of the analysis was created by the IntUne project.1 A group
              | of national experts coded 298 Euromanifestos2 of all political areas in fifteen member states.3
              | Although these documents refer to the 1979-2004 period, the large majority actually refer to
              | 1994-2004.4 One could claim that parties may have changed their attitudes over this period.
              | In fact, this does not seem to be the case for radical parties, as the empirical analysis has
              | already shown that a change in the attitudes toward the EU can be found mainly in the
              | moderate parties (Gabel & Hix 2004). On the contrary, radical parties are not inclined to
              | change their attitudes on the EU, they tend instead to be rather stable in their opposition
              | (Szcerbiack & Taggart 2003, 2008) that, over time, has only become more salient, especially
              | in the case of the radical right (Kriesi 2007). We expect, therefore, variations across time to
              | be quite limited in scope, but I will report them anyway when they are deemed relevant.
              | The analysis starts with an examination of the level of occurrence of the selected themes
              | within the Euromanifestos. In table 2, we find evidence of the fact that, in their documents
              | radical parties generally refer to such themes as often as (or even more often than)
              | mainstream parties do. Certainly, the table does not contain any information about the
              | direction of the positions expressed on the specific issues in the documents. However, it was
              | relevant to find confirmation that the analyzed themes do play an important role in the party
              | discourse on the EU. They are important components of the party stance on the EU.
              | Although across parties some differences can be found in terms of frequency of occurrence,
              | overall, the selected themes recurred frequently in the Euromanifestos (in between 51.7 and
              | 88.8 per cent of Euromanifestos, depending on the theme). Hence, we can be confident that
              | they represent good empirical referents for the analysis of party attitudes toward the EU as
              | they really structured the programmatic supply provided in the Euromanifestos.

              | paper was also supported by the Italian National project ―Il processo di integrazione europea in una fase di stallo

              | The analysis moves now to a more in-depth examination of the direction of party positions.
              | For this purpose, I applied multinomial logistic regression models for the analysis of the
              | content analytic variables drawn from the Euromanifestos. This technique allowed me to
              | estimate the likelihood for radical parties to express Eurosceptical positions as compared to
              | mainstream parties. Subsequently, within the radical party category I separated left from
              | right. The comparison of attitudes between parties of different ideological orientations allows
              | us to understand the phenomenon of Euroscepticism comparatively and to insert these
              | attitudes within the broader context of inter-party competition and of contestation of the EU
              | issue. Precisely, multinomial logistic regression models estimate the likelihood of different
              | cases to belong to each category of the dependent variable when compared to a reference
              | category. For example, in table 3, the ExpB coefficient estimates the likelihood of each
              | category of the dependent variable ‗membership‘ to occur compared to the reference
              | category ‗favourable opportunities‘. In other words, the model estimates how likely it is to find
              | in the Euromanifestos (of the mainstream and radical parties respectively) ‗no reference‘, a
              | ‗mixed‘ or a ‗negative‘ evaluation of the country membership, compared to the reference
              | category ‗favourable opportunities‘. I found that in their Euromanifestos, radical parties have
              | almost eleven times (ExpB=10.75) greater a likelihood to represent membership as a
              | negative constraint than to represent it as a positive opportunity. On the contrary, such
              | likelihood is almost null (ExpB=0.2) for mainstream parties.5 In particular, I found that 70% of
              | the Euromanifestos of the radical right (and 64.7% of those of the radical left) expressed a
              | negative evaluation of the country membership. Consequently, the expectation of a broad
              | Eurosceptism rooted in the radical parties is confirmed by the data.
              | 5 I considered mainstream parties to be those belonging to the following party families: Christian democrats,
              | socialists, liberals, conservatives, regionalists (with the exception of the Northern League), greens and some other
              | moderate parties on indication of the national experts involved in the research. I categorized Communists, extreme
              | left, nationalists and the extreme right as radical parties.

              | With this negative evaluation of membership on the side of radical parties follows their strong emphasis
              | on the necessity for the national government to oppose decisions at the EU level that could constrain
              | the member states. In order to find evidence of this, I analyzed how parties think the national
              | government should behave in the EU arena. In table 4, ‗defence/rejection‘ is the reference category. I
              | found that mainstream parties are eight times (ExpB=8.18) more likely to express a preference for a
              | cooperative behavior, thus for an acquiescent conduct of the national government. Furthermore, they
              | are over five times more likely (ExpB=5.63) to prefer the leadership of the national government within
              | the EU arena, hence to be in favor of a voice option. In the end, as it was easy to predict, mainstream
              | parties are divided on the assertiveness and the role that the national government should have within
              | the EU. On the contrary, the category of radical parties is more focused on the ‗defence/rejection‘
              | solution, while the likelihood for the Euromanifestos of these parties to fall in any other category is not
              | significant.6 However, it is important to highlight the differences in the attitudes of the two extremes.
              | The ‗defence/rejection‘ category occurs in 43.3% of Euromanifestos of radical right parties as
              | compared to 6.7% of those of the radical left whose most recurrent category (38.2%) is instead that of
              | cooperation7 (occurring in only 6.7% of Euromanifestos of the radical right). These results show that,
              | although Euroscepticism is deeply rooted in the radical parties under the form of a broad attitude, for
              | instance when they evaluate country membership, when we break-down the broad stance into more
              | specific attitudes we find that Euroscepticism is definitely more pronounced in the radical right.
              | 6 Changing the reference category does not change the result, as radical parties have a tendency to concentrate
              | their preference in the ‗defence/rejection‘ category.
              | 7 In particular, Izquierda Unida and Synaspimos are the main advocate of this solution within the radical left.

              | Moving the analysis to the policy dimension, we find the same pattern. In particular, we find
              | the same tendency for attitudes toward foreign and defense policy. In table 5, mainstream
              | parties show 9.9 and 9.2 times greater likelihood respectively for the exclusive EU
              | competence and a shared EU-national competence, as compared to the reference category
              | of the exclusive national competence. So, mainstream parties are rather divided in terms of
              | degree of involvement of the EU in foreign policy, something that could explain the difficulties
              | in integrating the ex-Second Pillar of the EU. However, they agree overwhelmingly on some
              | kind of involvement of the EU, while they voice a preference for the exclusive national
              | competence only very rarely. The same tendency can be found for defense policy (tab. 6) as
              | the preference of mainstream parties for the exclusive European competence and for the
              | shared EU-national competence is 12.3 and 10.3 times greater than for the reference
              | category of exclusive national competence. For both policies, values for the radical parties
              | are instead not significant. The reason can be found in the dispersion of their preferences
              | across different categories. Dispersion occurs between radical left and radical right, as well
              | as across countries. Overall, the preference of radical parties for the exclusive national
              | competence exceeds that for any other option. They voice this sovereignist stance in foreign
              | and defense policy in 27% and 25% of their Euromanifestos respectively, without any
              | particular distinction between left and right. However, somewhat unexpectedly, the share for
              | the other categories is also similar. Notably, over time the radical left – but not the radical
              | right – becomes more supportive of the EU competence, until a peak in 2004 when 66.6% of
              | I H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 9
              | the Euromanifestos of the radical left supports the EU competence (either exclusive or
              | shared) in foreign policy and 53.9% in defense policy8.
              | In sum, differences between mainstream and radical parties are remarkable since the EU involvement
              | in these two policy areas is much less popular with radical parties. However, only a minority of radical
              | parties rejects the EU involvement in principle, while on this issue the radical left has become
              | increasingly aligned with mainstream parties over time. In the end, the radical right is the main
              | stronghold of opposition against the communitarisation of foreign and defense policy. However, even
              | for these parties, Euroscepticism is not absolute. Although integration of these policies deeply
              | challenges one of the core values of the radical right, namely the defense of national sovereignty, its
              | national components are divided on what is the best level of competence. In some countries, radical
              | right parties support some EU competence in foreign and defense policy9 as they see the EU as a
              | potential barrier against globalization and U.S dominance that they oppose more fiercely: against both
              | forces, any national scale action would be powerless, especially from countries of small size or
              | reduced strategic power. Ultimately, although at various degrees and certainly more to the left than to
              | the right, the EU has acquired some legitimacy as a level of governance even within the programmatic
              | supply of radical parties. Euroscepticism in this sphere prevails in the radical right, but as we have
              | seen, not unanimously.

              | We move now to the analysis of immigration policy. On the one hand, the likelihood of a
              | preference for the exclusive EU competence or the shared EU-national competence on the
              | side of mainstream parties is almost eight (ExpB=7.75) and five (ExpB=5.13) times greater
              | than it is for exclusive national competence (reference category). However, a lack of
              | reference to immigration issues is the most likely possibility for mainstream parties
              | (ExpB=14.38). On the other hand, the preferences of radical parties are again dispersed
              | among different categories. Even more than for foreign and defense policy, such dispersion
              | is to be attributed mainly to the radical left. As a matter of fact, the position of radical right
              | parties is more univocal as 42.9% of their Euromanfestos support the exclusive national
              | competence in immigration policy. It is evidence of the fact that radical right parties make
              | their programmatic supply on this issue very distinctive from that of the other parties and
              | characterize their stance along the lines of a more openly nationalistic posture. Although less
              | than half of the Euromanifestos of the radical right really favor the most nationalistic solution,
              | the other more recurrent category is the no reference one, especially in the new member
              | states10, while a preference for the EU involvement in the immigration policy is only residual
              | among radical right parties.11
              | 10 For example, in 2004, the Lithuanian National Centre Party and Party of National Progress, and the League of
              | Polish Families did not make any reference to the issue of the favourite level of competence in immigration policy.
              | 11 Only the Italian MSI-National Alliance in 1994 and the German Republicans in 1999-2004 supported the

              | To conclude this part of the analysis, I can summarize that I found confirmation of the fact
              | that the radical right is the main stronghold of party-based Euroscepticism. However, this
              | attitude is broad more than it is absolute, and most importantly, it is not univocal across the
              | European countries. Although still very criticized, the EU has acquired legitimacy by radical
              | right parties in some member states where its role as a policy-maker is relatively welcome.
              | The very existence of the EU is therefore not questioned by these parties. The
              | Euroscepticism of the radical right is still quite strident, especially if one compares their
              | attitudes to those of mainstream parties and even of radical left parties whose opposition
              | against the EU has become more nuanced over time. Still, it would be difficult to talk about a
              | principled opposition of the radical right against the EU when parties are so divided about the
              | role the EU should play in the European system of governance.

              | The paper now moves to the analysis of the institutional behavior of the MEPs of the radical
              | right. Specifically, I will examine whether they vote cohesively within the EP. As a matter of
              | fact, in the previous section it has already been shown that the programmatic supply of the
              | radical right is characterized by some common positions, as well as by some important
              | differences. We now investigate whether these differences also translate into a diverse
              | behavior of radical right MEPs within the EP. In addition, this part of the analysis allows us to
              | shed a light on the problem of the level of coherence existing between the protest-based
              | rhetoric of radical right parties in the election campaign (however mitigated by specific policy
              | positions that, as we have seen, are not so much opposed to the EU) and their institutional
              | behavior after the elections.
              | For the analysis, I have selected the EP group ‗Independence/Democracy‘ (IND/DEM) of the
              | 2004-2009 legislature. The group was created in 2004, when parties from the Eurosceptical
              | ‗Europe of Democracy and Diversities‘ group made an alliance with some parties from the
              | new member states. The most important parties of IND/DEM were the following12: the UK
              | Independence Party (UKIP), the League of Polish Families, the Italian Northern League
              | (suspended in 2006 and then expelled from the group after the scandal of the t-shirt worn by
              | the party member Calderoli showing anti-Islamic cartoons), and the Movement for France.
              | Additionally, some MEPs from Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands and
              | Sweden also took part in the group. However, other important radical right parties such as
              | the French Front National and the Vlaams Belang did not join IND/DEM and decided instead
              | to belong to the ‗Non Attached‘ group. By the end of the legislature, especially after the
              | expulsion of the Northern League, the group could rely on just 2.8 per cent of the seats in the
              | EP. Definitely, this lack of unity within the EP of radical right parties gives evidence of a lack
              | of cohesion of their intents and strategy. So the argument of whether they could be
              | considered a genuine party family finds negative evidence here. At least, these parties are
              | not transnationally organized as most other party families are and this, in turn, creates an
              | impediment for the establishment of greater coherence of action within this political area.
              | This lack of transnational organization also creates a problem for the analysis carried in this
              | paper: due to dispersion of the radical right MEPs in various groups, any result on IND/DEM
              | only partially represents the radical right as a whole. Furthermore, the empirical referent
              | considered in the two parts of the analysis is not identical, as the Euromanifesto data
              | examined in the previous section referred to a larger number of radical right parties than the
              | data on the voting behavior of the MEPs of Independence/Democracy. However, I will show
              | that in spite of these limitations, it is still possible to produce some considerations and to
              | advance some tentative conclusions about the phenomena under analysis.
              | 12 The group ceased to exist in 2009 when some of its components united with the remnants of the ‗Union for a
              | Europe of Nations‘ group to create a new group called ‗Europe of Freedom and Democracy‘.
              | I H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 13
              | The first problem that I am going to explore concerns the internal cohesion within IND/DEM.
              | For this purpose, in table 8 I have reported a measurement elaborated by Hix and Noury of
              | the internal cohesion of the EP groups in the period 2004-2009 based on the roll-call votes
              | (all data in this section are available on-line at http://www.votewatch.eu).13 It clearly emerged
              | that within the EP context, IND/DEM was the group with lower internal cohesion,
              | comparatively as low as the Non-Attached group. To be more precise, their level of cohesion
              | was about half the average level (0.8) of all party groups with the exclusion of IND/DEM and
              | the Non-Attached. On the other extreme of the political spectrum, the European United
              | Left/Nordic Green Left group (GUE-NGL) showed a level of internal cohesion in line with the
              | above mentioned average. Hence, the radical right was internally divided along its national
              | components much more than any other group of the EP was. Indeed, we only need to recall
              | that some ideological diversity also emerged in the Euromanifesto analysis, but strikingly
              | wide divisions emerged in the way the radical right MEPs voted in the EP. It is interesting to
              | note that the low level of internal cohesion of the IND/DEM is also confirmed when we
              | disaggregate votes by policy areas, as scores tend to be close to the overall cohesion rate:
              | 
              | 
              | 
              | 0.5 for budgetary policy, economics, foreign and defense policy, culture and
              | education;
              | 0.4 for justice and home affairs, unemployment, social policy, development,
              | transportation, tourism, fishery, equal opportunities;
              | 0.3 for agriculture, environment, industry, energy, research, internal market.
              | Precisely, among the parties in this group, the UKIP voted against the party line one out of
              | three times and the League of Polish Families one out of five.14 Hence, among the larger
              | parties that formed the group, the latter was the one that contributed more to determine the
              | party line. However, its defection rate of one fifth should not be ignored and it is the sign of a
              | rather undisciplined conduct and lack of leadership within the political group. Since we
              | registered an extremely low level of internal cohesion, this could not be explained by the
              | defections of the British and the Polish MEPS alone. It follows that the other MEPs of the
              | group representing even smaller parties have all together defected the party line more
              | frequently.
              | 13For each vote, the group cohesion was calculated using the index of Rice: (Y-N)/(Y+N+A), where Y = nr. of votes
              | in favour, N = nr. of votes against and A = nr. of abstentions. The cohesion rate of each group is the mean score of
              | all roll-call votes.
              | 14The other parties of IND/DEM have less than five representatives in the group. It is not possible to calculate
              | loyalty scores for national groups with less than five MEPs. A national group is made up by MEPs from the same
              | member state who join the same European Political Group.

              | Having established that radical right parties within the EP are not cohesive, it is now
              | interesting to analyze how they behave vis a vis the other parties. One underlying
              | characteristic of radical right parties is indeed their anti-system rhetoric. For this reason, they
              | have alternatively been labeled as populist, extreme right, fascist, or protest-based
              | organizations (Mudde 2007, 29). Indeed, at the national level, they often reject the system
              | from its constitutional foundations. At the same time, the system tends to exclude them; at
              | the national level several institutional barriers such as those coming from the electoral rules
              | have been built in order to marginalize these parties. So, with only some exceptions and
              | contrary to mainstream parties, radical right parties are usually rooted on the ground of the
              | society more than they are in public office. As a consequence, they are also largely excluded
              | from public resources - consisting mostly of state financing - that are instead largely
              | available to cartel parties (Katz & Mair1995). Hence, at the national level radical right parties
              | can successfully represent themselves as separate from the system and their distinctiveness
              | as a form of non-collusion and disinterestedness. They can do so especially when they
              | criticize the state elites, one of the main arguments in their rhetoric. What happens then
              | when we shift the focus of the analysis to the EU system? Is their anti-system protest also
              | transferred to the EU level? We found that the Euromanfestos are rich in criticisms to the
              | country membership in the EU. (table 3). Now we analyze whether such a broad stance also
              | corresponds to an institutional practice of outsiders within the EP.
              | In reality, the tendency of IND/DEM, as well as of the radical left, to a participatory and even
              | collusive behavior within the EP should not be underestimated (table 9). Although the
              | number of times this group was part of a majority in the EP was the lowest among all party
              | groups, the total rate (46.2 per cent) is still considerable and certainly higher than we could
              | expect from any anti-system force. Hence, in almost half of the cases, IND/DEM was part of
              | a parliamentary majority. To be sure, their votes only converged with large majorities
              | composed of at least two large parties (the European People‘s Party [EPP], the European
              | Socialist Party [PSE], or the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe [ALDE]).
              | Therefore, their vote was not necessary to build minimum winning coalitions, and
              | consequently their blackmail potential and coalition power remained very limited even when
              | they joined a majority. Just as at the national level (where only few exceptions can be found
              | in countries such as Austria and Italy), also in the EP the radical right is largely non-influent
              | for the formation of coalitions. For this reason, it is surprising that they voted along the lines
              | of a parliamentary majority so many times. Especially when we consider that only a fraction
              | I H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 15
              | of the votes of IND/DEM converged with those of parliamentary majorities of centre-right
              | leaning parties (either EPP, ALDE or Union for the Europe of Nations [UEN]) and could
              | therefore be justified on the bases of some common ideological inclinations. In most cases,
              | the majority also included (to a greater or lesser degree) the PSE, the Greens, and the GUE-
              | NGL. An in-depth analysis of the contents of the bills passed with the support of IND/DEM
              | would be necessary in order to discover the motivations for their institutional behavior – one
              | that could certainly not be labeled as the behavior of outsiders. It is, however, a research
              | goal that goes beyond the scope of the analysis presented in this paper, but one that future
              | research should consider in order to shed light on this interesting phenomenon concerning
              | the institutional behavior of the public office of radical right parties.

              | Certainly, convergence with the EP majority is also due to the consensual nature of the EP
              | where decisions are often lowest common denominator agreements among the different
              | forces that are represented in this assembly. However, even from this perspective, we could
              | not avoid defining the strategy of the radical right in the EP as either one of voice, or one of
              | acquiescence. Being that their votes converged with those of large coalitions and were
              | therefore not necessary to form a majority, we can hypothesize that the blackmail potential of
              | IND/DEM was really limited on those occasions, as well as their capacity to influence the
              | final outcome in the decision-making process. Hence, their strategy should really be
              | characterized by acquiescence more than by a real capacity to voice their preferences and
              | force the other parties to compromise with them. In the end, it seems that radical right parties
              | are rather maximalists on the EU in their rhetoric (although even in this respect the analysis
              | of Euromanifestos has shown that in some countries they accept the EU as a level of
              | governance) but they tend to exclude the most maximalist option of exit when they operate
              | within the EU institutions. This result is also confirmed by the attendance rate (82.5%) to the
              | plenary sessions of the EP by the MEPs of IND/DEM, a rate that is very close to the average
              | of the other (mostly mainstream) groups (84.6%). As we have seen, a vote with the majority
              | corresponds to this high attendance rate in almost half of the cases and a vote against (or
              | abstention) in the remaining part. Only when they vote against the majority do they express
              | their protest against the main groups, usually by voting with parties on the extremes of both
              | left and right (Hagemann 2009). It is evident that radical right parties collect votes in the
              | 16 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H S
              | European elections based on a broad Eurosceptical stance (with policy specific positions
              | that are sometimes not as much Eurosceptical). However, once in the EP, it is important to
              | note that they express their dissent making use of the rules of the game, voting with the
              | opposition more than the other forces do, but voting almost as much with the majority. If
              | these figures were known by the larger public, it would not be surprising if the protest-based
              | electorate of these parties felt dissatisfied with their institutional conduct.
              | It seems that the public office of these parties is way less anti-EU than the political discourse
              | of their central office. There may be several explanations for this behavior. On the one hand,
              | there might be a search for legitimacy on the part of these parties. They want to participate in
              | the decision-making process and they want to be considered credible coalition partners. This
              | could be achieved more easily in an assembly such as the EP where coalitions are formed
              | on an issue-by-issue basis, rather than following pre-arranged coalition agreements between
              | either the groups or the national delegations. On the other hand, radical right parties might
              | be aware of the advantages which come with representation in the EP. They can have a
              | public office that is often lacking at the national level where they are frequently excluded
              | from institutional representation due to electoral rules, the impact of strategic voting in first
              | order elections, or the marginalization by mainstream parties. The advantages of
              | representation in the EP are not negligible, especially for small radical parties. Notably, from
              | a financial point of view, parties represented in the EP have access to public financing, which
              | has become so relevant for the survival of parties in contemporary times (Katz & Mair 1995,
              | Aucante & Dézé 2008). Such funds come directly from the EU budget, in order to allow the
              | organizational functioning of the EP. As well, they come from the national budget under the
              | form of ordinary contributions or reimbursements of the electoral expenses. Ultimately, either
              | directly or indirectly, the EP is doing a lot for the financial and organizational survival of small
              | radical parties. Alternatively, we could look for other non-strategic explanations of the
              | institutional behavior of radical right MEPs. Just like any other actor who is inserted in the
              | European decision-making system, they become gradually socialized to the practices and
              | principles of the EU governance, through forms of interaction oriented toward consensualism
              | that in the long term create a sense of trust and identification with the institution and with the
              | system at large (Schimmelfennig 2000). This could also explain why the radical right often
              | takes a more pragmatic stance in the EP than the rhetoric of their central office would
              | anticipate. None of these potential explanations can be examined in-depth in this paper, but
              | certainly knowledge on the radical right, as well as on EU politics, would greatly benefit from
              | the analysis of these possible determinants of the party conduct in the EP. In the meanwhile,
              | although it is not yet possible to talk about a radical right in the EU that is anti-establishment
              | but open to government it seems there is already enough evidence to talk about a radical
              | right that is anti-establishment and part of the system.

              | Conclusion
              | The analysis that was carried out in this paper shows that the radical right is the party block
              | characterized by the lowest levels of internal cohesion in the whole context of the European
              | party families. This finding holds true both in the analysis of ideology that was examined
              | through party Euromanifestos, and in that of institutional behavior shown by the data on the
              | roll-call votes of the MEPs. The Euroscepticism of the radical right is well-known, however
              | after an accurate analysis, it showed that it is discontinuous and lacks a common vision
              | across its national party components. If this diversity was verified not only with respect to the
              | European issue but to other issues as well, there would be reason to question whether the
              | radical right could be defined as a party family, or if it should instead be considered a
              | disordered aggregation of national parties of erratic ideological positions.
              | The analysis of two different arenas, namely a second-order national electoral arena and the
              | EP institutional arena, very clearly show that the radical right in Europe is divided into a
              | plethora of stances and policy preferences and by reciprocal enmities and political
              | antagonism. From the analyses, it emerged that their ideological foundations, programmatic
              | supply and organizational features are so diverse that it even seems hard to group them
              | under a distinctive party family name. This finding reinforces Mudde‘s (2007) argument about
              | the necessity to classify parties that common wisdom tends to pinpoint within the radical right
              | with more accuracy. Certainly, this paper shows that in Europe, a famille spirituelle grouping
              | the main parties of this political area is, in reality, hardly discernible and even the use of the
              | concept of party family could be incorrect when referring to the radical right.
              | At the same time, a clear tendency toward a greater pragmatism and moderation of the
              | MEPs of the radical right emerged in the paper as compared to the party programmatic
              | announcements. Although radical right parties represent a source of opposition within the
              | EP, some of them also take part in parliamentary majorities in almost the same proportion.
              | This phenomenon shows that there is a remarkable distance between the central office and
              | the public office of these parties, at least in terms of coherence between the statements of
              | the former and the institutional conduct of the latter. Whether this is a conscious, or even a
              | strategic game played by these parties, is a question that this paper has not addressed.
              | Certainly, their conduct raises many questions that future research may address. Overall, the
              | party public office in the EP is more institutionalized, more inserted in the legislative process
              | and even more collusive with the other parties of both sides of the political spectrum than the
              | rhetoric and statements of central office makes the public believe. The paper documented
              | the ambivalence between a more Eurosceptical party central office and a more collusive EP
              | public office. This conflicting valence between central office and public office could be a sign
              | of difficulty for these parties in playing the role of legislators and, at the same time, represent
              | a protest-based electorate. Especially in an assembly like the EP where there is not a clear
              | government to oppose and so the temptation to collude with the other parties can be
              | 18 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H S
              | amplified. Whether or not this phenomenon limits the capacity of radical right parties in the
              | EP to represent their electorate - as they fail to deliver firm opposition against the
              | mainstream parties - is an interesting problem. At the same time, however, the level of
              | information of citizens about the activities in the EP is so low that a disappointing behavior of
              | the MEPs would hardly result in a sanction vote in the following elections. So, it was
              | interesting to document that in an assembly characterized by limited popular scrutiny as is
              | the EP, the conduct of some radical right parties is not one of principled opposition, it is
              | actually less extreme than many would expect.
