              | Contemporary power relations implicate animals in complex ways, which
              | have yet to be fully appreciated by sociocultural theorists. Like the popular
              | British candy after which the book is named, Franklin approaches Dolly
              | the cloned sheep as a novel mixture: at once a living creature, a rich cultural
              | symbol, a viable example of recombinant biotechnology, a commodity, a
              | cyborg, and the outcome of intersecting lineages. With Dolly Mixtures, an
              | ethnographic monograph instantiating the “animal turn” in social studies
              | of health science, Franklin makes a watershed contribution.
              | Dolly Mixtures is a public ethnography, for several key informants have
              | published inﬂuential scientiﬁc papers, some of these scientists have become
              | public ﬁgures, and cloning is hotly debated in academic ﬁelds such as
              | bioethics as well in the mass media. Against this backdrop, Franklin must
              | have faced some daunting challenges in carrying out this project, from
              | negotiating access through to writing up. The very public status of Dolly and
              | of the topic of cloning certainly forces Franklin to specify her contribution.
              | She addresses, head-on in the introduction and discreetly throughout in
              | her referencing practices, the role of science writing by sociocultural
              | scholars. Ultimately, Dolly Mixtures exempliﬁes a sort of science writing
              | that sociocultural scholars can and arguably should aim to do. Perhaps one
              | of the Franklin’s most important contributions is the deceptively simple
              | conversational style in which she has written Dolly Mixtures. Deeper
              | dialogue, versus dogmatic debate, is sorely needed to come to grips with
              | shifts in the range of roles played by animals in human lives.
              | Franklin (pp. 9–10) ardently defends society and culture as objects to
              | be analyzed through material refractions, Dolly being a case in point.
              | Thus, she explicitly rejects several inﬂuential scholars’ directives on how
              | to approach nonhuman entities. She is chieﬂy concerned with elucidating
              | and demonstrating how, in the course of exerting control over the lives
              | of sheep, people impose or otherwise bring about order in their own lives
              | and in the lives of other people. That is why she adopts “the in some ways
              | very conservative idiom of genealogy” (p.10).
              | Drawing from cultural studies, anthropology, gender and kinship
              | theory, science studies, postcolonial criticism, the history of agriculture,
              | and the history of biology, Franklin foregrounds Dolly so as to investigate
meta          | 133
text          | health: 12(1)
              | the intersection between the materiality and representation. Although
              | scholarly attention to such entwinings of ‘nature / culture’ has a long history,
              | Franklin’s analysis offers a novel perspective in that she deftly illuminates
              | how Dolly stems from but also disrupts lineages of capital, nation, empire,
              | and science. In accounting for Dolly’s life and times, Franklin considers the
              | just-past alongside the longue durée and the emerging present. For while
              | Dolly herself was cloned into existence, domesticated sheep attained their
              | various bodily forms in relation to people’s desires for something warm
              | to wear and for something good to eat, and in relation to imperial desires
              | too. Nowadays, the frontiers straddled by animals akin to Dolly include
              | science and aspirations for longevity. Ultimately, Franklin’s attention to
              | genealogy in context is what makes her analysis so textured, dynamic, and
              | interesting.
              | Franklin does not offer a problem-and-solution analysis, whether on
              | moral, political, or economic grounds; rather, similar to Donna Haraway’s
              | contributions to critical theory, she aims to create new critical sensibilities
              | that allow us to make sense of Dolly’s coming into being, and of her passing.
              | Although somatic cell nuclear transfer, the technology central to the Dolly
              | technique, is both inefﬁcient and expensive, Dolly nonetheless represented
              | an innovation. Franklin shows that animals animate health politics not only
              | as disease models, but also as sources of food and therapeutics. The use of
              | animals and animal parts to produce therapeutics intended to enter human
              | bodies is sometimes called pharming, and indeed the products derived
              | from animals include pharmaceuticals. For example, most insulin products
              | used to treat human diabetics still derive from porcine insulin. As Franklin
              | (p. 195) points out, Dolly was used not as livestock but as lifestock; in other
              | words, Dolly was not necessarily a viable agricultural commodity but was
              | a principle or base biotechnology that helped inaugurate a postgenomic
              | future/present rooted in stem cell science and tissue engineering. These
              | technologies carry transformative implications for agriculture, medical
              | research, and embodiment. These implications are why, Franklin argues,
              | we desperately need new critical language to make sense of Dolly, not to
              | celebrate ‘Dollymania’ nor to condemn emergent biotechnologies but to
              | understand what such ovine-machines imply for future human/nonhuman
              | associations and collectivities.
              | Dolly Mixtures comprises an introduction followed by ﬁve chapters
              | and conclusion bearing titles made up of a single word: “Origins,” “Sex,”
              | “Capital,” “Nation,” “Colony,” “Death,” and “Breeds.” One way to read
              | Dolly Mixtures is as an analytic reﬂection on how meanings and practices
              | have shifted since Raymond Williams’s (1983 [1976]) Keywords was last
              | revised. Franklin expressly pays homage to Williams: “The ability of the
              | rural farm animal to evoke what Raymond Williams calls ‘whole ways
              | of life and whole ways of struggle’ captures one of the most important
              | sources of emotional attachment to sheep as embodiments of human labor,
              | industry, and accomplishment” (p. 193). Later, Franklin turns to Williams
              | for an epigraph on “production and reproduction” in the concluding
meta          | 134
text          | Book Review
              | chapter entitled, “Breeds” (p. 195) Keywords contains entries on “Sex,”
              | “Capitalism,” “Nationalist,” and “Imperialism,” but not on origins or on
              | death. The absence of entries on “origins” or on “death” or, for that matter,
              | on “life” in Keywords may imply that, over the past 25 years or so, cultural
              | politics has come to be more about efforts bent on exerting control over
              | cells, organisms, and entire populations. But if so, Franklin’s focus on
              | Dolly gives pause, for Dolly’s body was a nonhuman one, even if created
              | and shaped in relation to human desires.
              | Not one monograph can ever be said to wholly complete, and as we have
              | already noted, one of the main contributions that Franklin makes is to
              | invite rather than foreclose further research, theorizing, and commentary.
              | Franklin (p.. 9–10, 15–16) “sheepishly” owns up to a number of limitations,
              | including this telling comment: “As an astute reader of noted of its
              | meandering path and stupefying accumulation of ovine detail, the problem
              | with following sheep around is that they get everywhere” (p. 8–9).
              | Yet one place Franklin does not tread is scrapie, a disease caused by an
              | infectious protein (or prion) that afﬂicts sheep. Her inattention to this ovine
              | prion disease is somewhat unfortunate as connections have been drawn
              | between scrapie, BSE, and cases of Creuzfeldt Jacob disease in people.
              | (Not long ago, brain and spinal tissue from sheep routinely entered cattle
              | feed. This practice is now banned in the United Kingdom and in many
              | other jurisdictions, on the grounds of preventing BSE.) Foot-and-mouth
              | disease, however, is nicely covered in Dolly Mixtures, Indeed, the “Death”
              | chapter could be read alongside research documenting the recent impact
              | of foot-and-mouth disease (e.g., Mort et al., 2005). As Franklin helps to
              | show, just because a disease cannot spread from animals to people does
              | not mean it cannot affect people.
              | Franklin’s approachable language makes this text suitable for upper-level
              | undergraduate and graduate-level analysis. She provides much ‘fodder’ for
              | thought, opening avenues for empirically grounded and theoretically astute
              | discourses to help make sense of contemporary human-animal relations.
              | Following on from some of the pathways that Franklin has highlighted or
              | opened up, we look forward to reading new work on the importance of
              | animals for human bodies and for people’s lives.
