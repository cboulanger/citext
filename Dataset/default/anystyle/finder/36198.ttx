              | Abstract
              | Two questionnaire studies try to answer the question if different social roles lead
              | to different decisions and justifications concerning ethical problems. In study I
              | participants were asked to decide either on an economic or a medical problem while
              | going into a related social role, in study II role expectations were asked for. The
              | decision had to be justified by weighing the importance of four classical ethical
              | positions: hedonism, intuitionism, utilitarianism, and deontology. The results show
              | that decisions and their justifications are dependent on social roles and partly on the
              | context. The effect which is interpreted as stemming from social standardization is
              | greater for role behavior. The differences between role behavior and expectation
              | indicate a misunderstanding crucial for group decisions.
              | Keywords: social role, social standardization, ethics, justification
              | Introduction
              | Ethical questions are demanding answers more urgent than ever. Recently, the
              | Schiavo case agitated people all over the world and split them up into advocates and
              | opponents of euthanasia. Not only medical questions and questions due to ever
              | advancing biotechnological feasibilities (Mitcham, 1990) keep the world busy but also
              | problems of politics and society, environment and business: How can the war on Iraq
              | be ethically justified? How should war prisoners be treated? Should the Kyoto
              | convention on climate change be ratified? Is it right to begin a trade war on textiles
              | with China? It is not surprising that commissions deliberating ethical problems are
              | more and more common and increasing in number. Although they decide, or at least
              | give recommendations, about live and death, peace and war, just and unjust, next to
              | nothing is known about their way of working and factors influencing their decisions. A
              | look back into history shows that groups in general are vulnerable to mistakes. And
              | wrong decisions can have serious consequences (Janis, 1972; Tuchman, 1984).
              | When forming a commission, members representing special professions, fields of
              | expertise or ideologies are selected. The gathering of people who keep different
              | social roles is a common attempt to try to handle ethical uncertainty and to gain
              | rational argumentation. The question is whether such a procedure is an adequate
              | one or if it rather strengthens social standardization carried over by the social roles
              | commission members keep. What if people do not feel free to decide individually but
              | will orientate themselves on social norms? Do people assume potential norms or do
              | such norms really exist? What would standardizations mean for decisions and their
              | ethical justifications? The general question is: How could decisions be ethically
              | justified at all? Normally, decisions are explained giving intellectual reasons (Janis,
              | 1972). Ethical justifications, however, are relatively rare and so far not in the focus of
              | active research, with one exception: the research on justice (Tyler, Boeckmann,
              | Smith & Huo, 1997).
              | The above mentioned questions are to be answered with two questionnaire
              | studies that try to determine the influence of social roles on decisions und their
              | justification concerning different ethical problems. Two different perspectives are
              | taken up: an internal and an external one. The first study focuses on role simulations.
              | Participants were asked to go into a defined social role and to act correspondingly.
              | The second study puts the questions which way of acting people expect from
              | keepers of different social roles.
meta          | 1
text          | Before describing the survey, theoretical basics to the factors involved into the
              | study are displayed: ethics commissions, social roles, and ethical positions.
              | Ethics commissions
              | Ethics committees and commissions are multidisciplinary composed ethical
              | advisory bodies in the form of small groups; they work in a defined institutional
              | context and should meet a special advisory need; they especially reflect the morally
              | problematic part of issues and problems. Ethics commissions can be characterized
              | concerning several factors with different specifications:
              |  political level or institutional dependence: from panels of individual hospitals up to
              | national commissions (e.g. President´s Council on Bioethics, 2001)
              |  composition of their members: representatives of different sciences, sometimes
              | of political parties
              |  topics: often problems concerning medical practice or bio-/gene technology
              |  application: e.g. advice, recommendation, information, control of norms, and
              |  type of statement: consensus, votes for several voices, or neutral option
              | catalogues.
              | Ethics commissions have various faces. Albeit the committees´ variety and
              | increasing number (McGee, Spanogle, Caplan & Asch, 2001), the knowledge about
              | them tends towards zero. The group processes within, their way of working, and the
              | quality of their results are more or less a “black box” (Witte, 1991).
              | From a social psychological point of view, the work of ethics commissions is a
              | complex group task (Witte, 2002a; Witte & Heitkamp, 2005). To the basic elements
              | of groups – and therefore of ethics commissions as well – belong group members
              | (Arrow, McGrath & Berdahl, 2000). Their composition can influence many aspects of
              | group life, including group structure, dynamics, and performance (Moreland, Levine
              | & Wingert, 1996).
              | Social roles
              | Here, the studies performed focus on another salient and influencing
              | characteristic of commissions´ members: the social role. The social role is a well
              | established category of every-day life with stereotyped images like doctor, priest, or
              | housewife (Goffman, 1961) which are dimensions of the social identity (Deaux, Reid,
              | Mizrahi & Ethier, 1995). Tacit ground rules form social identities and make everyday
meta          | 2
text          | life possible (Chriss, 1999). While there seems to be a tendency towards a
              | consensus about the contents of roles (Coser, 1991; Turner, 1972), the definitions of
              | “role” diverge. On the one hand, social role is defined as “the typical response of
              | individuals in a particular position” (Goffman, 1961, p. 93), a definition which
              | concentrates on behavior. On the other hand, there are definitions which focus on
              | the expectation towards role keepers (Woodland, 1968). Role is the “expectation
              | held by the group for how members in particular positions ought to behave” (Kenrick,
              | Neuberg & Cialdini, 2005, p. 400). Because each definition alone forms a stereotype
              | (Turner & Colomy, 1993), the synthesis of both seems to be adequate: the role is the
              | point of intersection between the behavior orientations of actors, the expectations of
              | others and the functional requirements of the society (Sarbin & Scheibe, 1983).
              | Close to social roles are social norms. Compare the above mentioned definition
              | of role by Kenrick, Neuberg and Cialdini (2005) with their definition of social norm: “A
              | rule or expectation for appropriate social behavior” (p. 4). Each role seems to be
              | defined through social norms which thus have an impact on the behavior of role
              | keepers.
              | Normally a social role is identified as an entity (Turner, 1972). In contrast to that,
              | Turner and Colomy (1993) propose a role differentiation. They sketch three
              | principles: functionality, representation, and tenability, which are highly interactive in
              | their effects. Thereby, role conflict resulting from ethical situations is significantly
              | greater than that of any other source (e.g. job, family) (Chonko & Burnett, 1983).
              | Every differentiating principle can be detected in the context of an ethics
              | commission. Functionality seems to be the main principle for the composition of the
              | committeés members. Different competencies and dispositions are associated with
              | different professions or offices. In contrast to Turner and Colomy, conflicts of
              | interests are thereby not avoided but wanted. An example is the committee on local
              | water management that comprises representatives of the water works, politicians,
              | and residents of the affected area (McDaniels, Gregory & Fields, 1999).
              | Another differentiating principle is representation. It is able to cover functionality
              | (Turner and Colomy, 1993). A current example is the decision of the German
              | National Ethics Council on cloning for reproduction or for biomedical research. Fields
              | of expertise or offices of the commission´s members ceased to play a role; they were
              | superseded by three divergent positions which had emerged during discussion. In
              | the end, it only mattered how many members opted for (i.e. represented) which
meta          | 3
text          | option (see German National Ethics Council, 2004). As the members of the German
              | National Ethics Council were not able to form a consensus, the importance of the
              | third differentiating principle comes into consideration. This means, if a consensus
              | had been achieved, some of the members would have given up their roles. This
              | obviously too costly alternative must have been against the third principle: tenability.
              | In sum, social roles can be detected and their influence can be esteemed as to
              | be highly probable. But if and how they work is fully open. The differentiation
              | between functionality and representation of roles (e.g. profession and decision of a
              | committee member) appears to be noteworthy. It has to be shown how far social
              | roles are functional as schemes and models for personal behavior (Athay & Darley,
              | 1982). Because social roles are associated with duties, norms, and expectations
              | (Donahue, Robins, Roberts & John, 1993), the influence of social roles is especially
              | crucial in the area of ethical decisions and their justification: Is everyone able to
              | decide freely and rationally or can roles lead to standardized decisions and
              | judgments which do not mirror the real situation?
              | Definitions of social role stress role behavior, role expectations, or both. It is not
              | clear to what extent role expectations and role behavior go together. It is likely that
              | there are differences between role behavior and role expectation because of the
              | differences of cognition and conation.
              | Ethical positions
              | Ethical research can be compared to a medal with two sides: one side refers to
              | ethics theory, which means to thousands of years of philosophy (Mac Intyre, 1976),
              | the other one refers to empirical psychology. Both sides can be conjoined in one of
              | our research question that is if theoretical ethical positions of practical philosophy
              | can be found empirically. The psychological perspective should be value-free.1 In
              | contrast to philosophy, psychology is not interested in ascertain the however based
              | superiority of one position. Psychology is only in the given facts of empiricism. The
              | question behind is not how people should justify their actions but rather how they do
              | it in practice and what factors influence their justifications. For example the
              | connection between identity, moral cognition (e.g. justification) and behavior (e.g.
              | decision) is of interest (Aquino & Reed, 2002).
              | 1 An exception is Kohlberg (e.g. Colby & Kohlberg, 1987) who put different ethical positions in
              | hierarchical order.
meta          | 4
text          | Normative ethical positions which are empirically stated are hedonism,
              | intuitionism, utilitarianism, and deontology, (Witte, 2001, 2002b, 2002c; Witte & Doll,
              | 1995). The meanings of these value attitudes have also been similarly found
              | (Barnett, Bass, Brown & Hebert, 1998; Forsyth, 1980, 1992; Forsyth & Nye, 1990;
              | Forsyth & Pope, 1984). Hedonism goes back to Aristippos and contains that an
              | action has to be performed when it brings pleasure to oneself. This could be
              | intermingled with egoism but it does not have to be. To put it more neutral, the action
              | performed should not be in opposition to the individual human dignity (Witte & Doll,
              | 1995). Intuitionism considers the reason for an action to stem from individual insight
              | or individual feeling regarding it as self-evident. Intuitionism prevents justifications
              | from running to a dead end, to an endless regress (Rawls, 1971; Witte & Doll,
              | 1995).Utilitarianism prescribes to perform that action which brings the greatest
              | happiness for the greatest number (of feeling beings). It is associated with the names
              | of J. Bentham and J. S. Mill. In contrast to utilitarianism, from a deontological point of
              | view the end does not justify the means, but the means themselves underlie the
              | need of justification. According to deontology, justifications should match universal
              | principles such as the categorical imperative (see I. Kant). Empirically, people assign
              | various degrees of importance to all four ethical positions (Witte, 2002b, 2002c). The
              | four ethical positions can be included in a taxonomy, which takes two dimensions
              | into account: content matter and the level of the judgment (table 1).

text          | It is essential that “different ethical judgments do not imply different ethical
              | frameworks and similar ethical judgments do not imply similar ethical frameworks“
              | (Hunt & Vitell, 1986, p. 14). In line with this statement ethical positions have been
              | found empirically in different contexts. The importance of different value attitudes
              | varies with culture (Maeng, 1995), with the quality of the actions that have to be
              | justified (individual, interpersonal, social actions) (Witte & Doll, 1995), with social
              | identity (Gollenia, 1999), and with professional socialization (Hackel, 1995).2
              | The variation with profession is especially important for our study, which puts its
              | stress on different social roles or professions members of (ethics) commissions have,
              | respectively. Gollenia (1999) asked people of three different professional
              | backgrounds, economic, medical, and, juridical, how they justify the germline
              | therapy. She found that economists prefer hedonistic positions, but that physicians
              | and jurists favor utilitarian and deontological positions. Many studies empirically
              | found connections between ethical decisions, actions, and ethical positions in an
              | economic context (e.g. Akaah & Riordan, 1989; Barnett et al., 1998; Tansey, Brown,
              | Hyman & Dawson, 1994). It is proved that economists prefer utilitarianism when it
              | comes down to economic decisions (Fritzsche & Becker, 1984; Premeaux & Mondy,
              | 1993).
              | It is likely that these results can be transferred to the contexts of (ethics)
              | commissions: members of distinct fields of expertise or professions should come to
              | dissimilar decisions and emphasize varying ethical positions as being important for
              | their decision. On the one hand, this would strengthen the claim for gathering people
              | of various backgrounds because only in this way optimal results could be attained in
              | a commission. On the other hand, a new question arises: If people actually decide
              | and justify according to their social roles, would this mean that the decisions made by
              | (ethics) commissions are not only predictable but also suggestible? Thus, the
              | decision depends on the role keepers represented in the committee and might be
              | manipulated by the organizer.
              | Research question and hypotheses
              | The studies try to answer the question, if there is a connection between the social
              | role someone holds and the decision and its justification concerning an ethical

text          | problem. Thereby it is of special interest whether decisions and their justifications are
              | socially standardized.
              | Two studies are to shed light on the influence of social roles from two different
              | perspectives which are known from the definitions of social role: behavior and
              | expectation. Study I tries to determine this connection whilst participants had to go
              | into a social role (role behavior). Study II tries to explore this connection whilst
              | participants had to think of the behavior of a typical role holder (role expectation). A
              | second question of investigation refers to the match between actual behavior of
              | someone holding a special social role and the expectations against him.
              | The following general hypotheses are to be tested:
              | H1: Social standardizations influence ethical decisions and their justifications by
              | means of context (medical, economic), thereby weighing the four ethical
              | positions differently.
              | H2: Social standardizations influence ethical decisions and their justifications by
              | means of social roles and these standardizations can be made explicit by the
              | different weighing of the four ethical positions.
              | H3: There are differences concerning ethical decisions and their justifications
              | between the conditions role behavior and role expectation measured through
              | the importance ratings of the four ethical positions.
              | Additionally, it is a finding of its own value to know the different forms of
              | justification depending on context, role behavior, and role expectation.
              | Research and analysis design
              | The hypotheses were tested in two research contexts because values and
              | decisions are dependent on the situation (for a review of different models see Jones,
              | 1991; Kurtines, 1984; Stead, Worrel & Stead, 1990, for an economic background).
              | Thus, it is possible to compare possible role effects and the emphasis on ethical
              | positions in both contexts. An ethical problem of a medical and one of an economic
              | context were provided, since ethical problems of these two fields are fervidly
              | discussed (for example in the media). The medical problem is: “Should genes be
              | manipulated to prevent hereditary diseases from breaking out?” The economic one
              | is: “Should the production be transferred abroad and thus jobs being cut in order to
              | save the company as a whole?” Each participant had to decide on either the medical
              | or the economic question while going into a related social role (study I) or while
meta          | 7
text          | expressing expectations for the behavior of someone holding a special social role
              | (study II). Each participant is linked to one social role, so that both studies follow a 2
              | x 6-design. The social roles are: member of an ethics commission, someone affected
              | by the decision, social scientist, jurist, politician, and health professional in the
              | medical context. They are member of the board of management, member of the
              | supervisory board, labor union representative, employee of administration, external
              | consultant, and politician in the economic context. These 12 roles comprise a broad
              | spectrum of positions and opinions, but at large, they were chosen at random. Partly,
              | they include contrarian advocacy groups. There are no parallels between the medical
              | and the economic roles.
              | Each participant had to fill out a questionnaire containing
              | a) a general decision on the main question,
              | b) 20 questions on the justification of the decision using ethical positions, and
              | c) personal data.
              | The 20-questions-part comprises four to six statements to every ethical position
              | whose importance had to be marked with a cross on a five-point-scale (from 1 = not
              | important to 5 = very important). Examples of items are “I am concerned for my
              | personal well-being.” for hedonism, “I am sure that this is the right behavior.” for
              | intuitionism, “In my opinion, one has to consider the consequences for everyone.” for
              | utilitarianism, and “In my opinion, general values are decisive for behavior.” for
              | deontology.
              | There is empirical evidence of the quality of the questionnaire which has been
              | tested repeatedly (Gollenia, 1999; Hackel, 1995; Maeng, 1995; Witte & Doll, 1995).
              | Our scope of interest comprised three different levels of analysis. Each level and
              | research question is associated with particular methods of analysis (figure 1).

              | Study I
              | 682 subjects took part: 383 females and 288 males. 11 persons did not mention
              | their gender. On the average the age was 27.4 years. The youngest subject was 17
              | of age, the oldest one was 81. 21.7% of the subjects mentioned a university grade as
              | their highest educational achievement. 66.7%
              | mentioned a university-entrance
              | diploma. It is not possible to determine the proportion of students. The subjects were
              | assigned randomly to the roles.
              | Study II
              | 551 subjects took part: 275 females and 256 males. 20 persons did not mention
              | their gender. On the average the age was 30.5 years. The youngest subject was 15
              | of age, the oldest one was 70. 24.8% of the subjects mentioned a university grade as
              | their highest educational achievement. 54.2%
              | mentioned a university-entrance
              | diploma. 49.1% of the participants were students. 74 participants filled out an online-

text          | questionnaire, which was exactly like the paper-and-pencil version. The subjects
              | were assigned randomly to the role expectations.
              | Results
              | Because study I and II were similar apart from their perspectives and to be able
              | to compare their results directly, their findings are described one straight after the
              | other.
              | Results concerning ethical positions
              | In study I, a factor analysis of the 20 items could educe the four ethical positions.
              | 47.5% of the variance could be explained. Hedonism cleared up 14.0% of the
              | variance (eigenvalue = 3.24), intuitionism 10.5% (eigenvalue = 1.38), utilitarianism
              | 11.0% (eigenvalue = 1.48), and deontology cleared up 11.9% (eigenvalue = 2.92)
              | after varimax rotation.
              | In study II, a factor analysis of the 20 items could educe the four ethical positions,
              | too. Totally, 60.3% of the variance could be explained. Hedonism cleared up 15.4%
              | of the variance (eigenvalue = 4.98), intuitionism 10.2% (eigenvalue = 3.28),
              | utilitarianism 12.8% (eigenvalue = 1.60), and deontology cleared up 13.9%
              | (eigenvalue = 1.17) after varimax rotation.
              | In study I, final scale reliabilities (Cronbach´s alphas) for hedonism, intuitionism,
              | utilitarianism, and deontology were .63, .60, .61, and .65, respectively. To reach an
              | alpha of .60, the item “One cannot justify every decision.” had to be eliminated of the
              | intuitionism scale.
              | In study II, final scale reliabilities (Cronbach´s alphas) for hedonism, intuitionism,
              | utilitarianism, and deontology were .79, .60, .75, and .73, respectively.
              | There is empirical evidence of the four ethical positions derived from practical
              | philosophy. The results suggest that the subjects accounted on all four ethical
              | positions in both studies. These results go in line with the findings of other studies
              | and proof to be stable.
              | Results concerning ethical positions and the research context
              | One has tested whether there are differences in the weighing of the ethical
              | positions between the medical and the economic context. To proof the mean
              | differences analyses of variance were used. First, the mean differences of ethical
meta          | 10
text          | positions for each context and within each scale were examined. We used a
              | repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with context as betweensubject
              | factors and the four ethical scales (hedonism, intuitionism, utilitarianism, and
              | deontology) as innersubject factors. The dependent variable is the weighing of
              | importance of the ethical positions related to the decision made. The results of the
              | repeated-measures ANOVA in study I indicated significant effects for the ethics
              | scales (F = 318.03, p < .00) (table 3). About 32% of the variance could be explained
              | by the ethics scales. The interaction between ethical positions and context could be
              | neglected because it explained less than 1% of the variance (F = 2.63, p = < .05).
              | The results suggest that despite different contexts comparable patterns of
              | justifications have been applied. In our culture there is a clear differentiation which
              | ethical positions are important for justification, also independent from the context and
              | the roles. (Which ethical positions are more or less important see below, table 2.)
              | The results of the repeated-measures ANOVA in study II indicated significant
              | effects for the ethics scales (F = 72.34, p < .00) (table 3). About 12% of the variance
              | could be explained by the ethics scales. The interaction between ethical positions
              | and context explained about 8% of the variance (F = 44.52, p = < .00). The results
              | suggest that somehow similar patterns of justifications have been applied which are
              | in parts independent of the context. But the influence of the context on this pattern
              | could not be neglected. The role expectation is less standardized than the role
              | behavior.
              | Secondly, we examined separately for each context to what extent variance
              | could be explained by roles. We used a repeated-measures ANOVA with roles as
              | betweensubject factors and the four ethical scales as innersubject factors. The
              | results of the repeated-measures ANOVA in the medical context in study I indicated
              | significant effects for the ethics scales (F = 181.57, p < .00) (table 5). 37% of the
              | variance could be explained by the ethics scales. The interaction between ethical
              | positions and roles could be neglected because it explained less than 1% of the
              | variance (F = 1.78, p = < .05). The results suggest that despite different roles
              | comparable patterns of justifications have been applied. This, however, does not
              | mean that the decisions favored are similar (see below).

              | than 1% of the variance (F = 2.23, p = < .00). The results resemble the ones in the

text          | Table 9 shows that most of the differences between the roles dated from
              | hedonism, followed by deontology, utilitarianism, and intuitionism (only significant
              | results of the t-tests performed are listed).
              | The weighing of different ethical positions for the justification of a decision varied
              | with the context (in parts in study I). The findings suggest that ethical positions were
              | significant for a differentiation between the justifications of diverse role keepers
              | whereas the effect was greater in the medical than in the economic context.
              | Subject of the next section was if there are differences in the weighing of the
              | ethical positions between the conditions “role behavior” (study I) and “role
              | expectation” (study II) within each research context. In the medical context in study I,
              | more variance of the factor “ethical position” could be explained than in study II (37%
              | vs. 28%), but in study II, the interaction between ethical position and context
              | accounted for an at least median amount of the variance (8%). The comparison
              | between the conditions “role behavior” (study I) and “role expectations” leads to the
              | conclusion that for role behavior the independence of the context of the justifications
              | applied is greater than for role expectations. This also means that patterns of ethical
              | positions for the justification of onés own behavior seem to be more rigid than the
              | expected pattern which to a greater part allows options.
              | In study I and II the justifications of diverse role keepers could be differentiated
              | by different ethical positions. The effect was greater for the condition of role
              | expectations (study II): more social roles and more ethical positions contributed to
              | the overall influence of roles than for the condition of role behavior (study I).
              | In the economic context in study I, more variance of the factor “ethical position”
              | could be explained than in study II (27% vs. 5%), but in study II, the interaction
              | between ethical position and context accounted for an at least median amount of the
              | variance (8%). The comparison between the conditions “role behavior” (study I) and
              | “role expectations” leads to the conclusion that for role behavior the independence of
              | the social role is greater than for role expectations. This also means that patterns of
              | ethical positions for the justification of onés own behavior seem to be more rigid
              | than the expected pattern which to a greater part takes the scope of roles into
              | account.

              | The interaction of ethical positions and social roles was greater on the condition
              | of role behavior (study I) than on role expectations (study II) (27% vs. 5% of variance
              | explained). In study I, the interaction could be stated as a median effect (10% of
              | variance explained), in study II as a minor effect (3% of variance explained).
              | Taken together there are differences in the weighing of the ethical positions
              | between the conditions “role behavior” (study I) and “role expectation” (study II)
              | within each research context.
              | Results concerning the connection of decision, justification, and role
              | Question of the next step was if there is a connection between decision,
              | justification, and role within a context. So we used multiple correlations with decision
              | as dependent variable and the four ethics scales and the roles as independent
              | variables. We wanted to determine to what extent the individual decisions within a
              | context could be predicted by the individual importance weights of the ethical
              | positions. Significant multiple correlations indicate individual freedom to choose and
              | justify the decision between roles and in roles. If instead social norms dictate a
              | decision the variance will be small and thus lead to an insignificant correlation.
              | Table 10 shows the results of a multiple correlation for the medical and the
              | economic context, respectively, in study I. Hedonism and deontology could explain
              | the individual decisions in the medical context, utilitarianism and deontology could
              | explain the individual decisions in the economic context. These ethical positions
              | could contribute significantly to the prediction of the individual decision. In the
              | medical context the individual decision depends on the amount of weighing the
              | individual ends and the common means. The other two predictors are socially
              | standardized without explanation of the individual choices. In the economic context
              | only general means and ends could predict the individual choices. In contrast to that,
              | the role did not contribute independently to the prediction in both contexts. The
meta          | 19
text          | interpretation is interindividually standardized, as expected from the theoretical
              | position and the definition of a role. Evidently, only the non-individual part of the role
              | interpretation was important as can be gathered from the interaction of role and
              | ethics. The effect for the medical context (ε² = 0.11) as well as the effect for the
              | economic context (ε² = 0.15) can be interpreted as median effects, whereas Cohen
              | (1977) determines a median effect as ε² = 0.15.
              | Table 10 shows the results of a multiple correlation for the medical and the
              | economic context, respectively, in study II. Intuitionism, utilitarianism, and deontology
              | could explain the individual decisions in the medical context, utilitarianism and

              | contexts. The individual interpretation of the role did also contribute independently to
              | the prediction in both contexts. Evidently, the individual part of the role interpretation
              | was important in the part of role behavior expectation. The effect for the medical
              | context (ε² = 0.11 and 0.24) as well as the effect for the economic context (ε² = 0.16
              | and 0.59) can be interpreted as medium effects with ε² = 0.15 and ε² = 0.35 as large
              | reference values.

              | However, ethical decisions and ethical positions were connected significantly in
              | both studies. By the means of the pattern of justification the decision could be
              | predicted in both contexts.
              | In study I, the individual interpretation of the social role did not contribute to the
              | prediction of the decision. The subjects are able to form a consistent interpretation of
              | the role behavior in both contexts. This was possible for the standardized part of the
              | role, which means that the behavior was prescribed by social norms that are
              | connected with a social role. In study II, the social role contributed to the prediction of
meta          | 20
text          | the decision. Standardization could not be stated. The individual interpretation of the
              | social role was responsible for its influence on the decision.
              | It was tested whether there are differences in the connections between decision,
              | justification, and role between the conditions “role behavior” (study I) and “role
              | expectation” (study II) within each research context. The above mentioned
              | differences between the findings of study I and II lead to acceptance.
              | Results concerning the connection between decision and justification
              | It was to be tested if there is a connection between decision and justification. It
              | was proofed on an interindividual level whether the decisions could be predicted by
              | the means of the justifications within the roles. For both contexts separately multiple
              | correlations with the decision as dependent and the four ethics scales as
              | independent variables were used. Study I: Table 11 shows that intuitionism which
              | had been able to differentiate between roles on the basis of mean differences could
              | neither contribute significantly to the prediction of the decision in the medical context,
              | nor when considering all roles together. That leads to the conclusion that individually
              | different interpretations of a role did not contribute to the prediction of the decision.
              | This applied to utilitarianism, too. Only hedonism and deontology were able to predict
              | the decision of politicians (ε² = 0.22) and members of an ethics commission who are
              | affected by the decision (ε² = 0.43). Both roles had a negative beta-weight for
              | hedonism (which means affirmation in this case) and a positive one for deontology
              | (which means denial). This finding suggests that people who act as politicians or as
              | members affected by the decision and interpret their role individually, would rather
              | accept gene manipulation if they preferred hedonic positions and refused
              | deontological positions. These roles tolerated individual decisions in contrast to the
              | other roles. Their decisions and justifications were standardized to a much greater
              | extent. Further predictions were not possible.
              | Study II, medical context: Table 11 shows that intuitionism which had been able
              | to differentiate between roles on the basis of mean differences could neither
              | contribute significantly to the prediction of the decision (exception: jurist), nor when
              | considering all roles together. That leads to the conclusion that individually different
              | interpretations of a role did not contribute to the prediction of the decision. This
              | applied to hedonism, too. Just utilitarianism and deontology were able to predict the
              | decisions when all roles were taken together. In detail, utilitarianism was able to
meta          | 21
text          | predict the decisions of social scientists and jurists. Deontology was able to predict
              | the decisions of ethics commission members who are affected by its decision and
              | jurists. To predict decisions within single roles deontology seemed to be most
              | suitable. The decisions of members of ethics commissions, members affected by the
              | decision, and jurists could be predicted. The three roles had a positive beta-
              | coefficient for deontology which means in this case that they would rather reject gene
              | manipulation if they preferred deontological positions. For jurists it is the same with
              | intuitionism. Social scientists had a negative beta-coefficient for utilitarianism. They
              | would rather accept gene manipulation the more they stress the importance of
              | utilitarian arguments. The four roles
              | mentioned possess individual scopes of
              | decision. The expected decisions and ratings were not as much determined as they
              | were for the other roles. For the residual roles reliable predictions were not possible.

              | weight for deontology (which means denial). This finding suggests that people who

              | individually, would rather deny the production transfer abroad if they preferred

              | significantly to the prediction of the decision when considering all roles together
              | (table 12).Utilitarianism, and deontology contributed significantly to the prediction of
              | the decision, too, which supports the results of the multiple correlation concerning the
              | differentiation between roles. On the level of single roles deontology was able to
              | predict the decisions of members of the board of management and employees of
              | administration. Both roles had a positive beta-weight for deontology (which means

              | The decision could be predicted by the interindividually different justification of
              | the decision. But the finding is narrowed referring to single roles and ethical
              | positions. The decision could be predicted for two of six roles each in the medical

              | this applied to hedonic and deontological positions and to a deontological position in
              | the economic context. The interindividual differences in these ethical positions
              | influence the decision within specific roles. In study II the scope of the results is
              | limited again: the decision could be predicted for four of six roles in the medical

text          | In study I, the economic context provided similar findings as to the ratio of
              | frequencies. Table 14 shows the frequency distributions. The decision against job
              | transfer was at a ratio of about 3:1 at large. Three-fourths of the people voted against
              | the production transfer abroad. The labor union representative is an exception:
              | almost all of them deny a production transfer abroad (94.1%). This time the chi-
              | square-test we used to determine whether there is a connection between decision
              | and role became significant (Chi² = 12.89; p < .05).
              | In study II, the economic context provided similar results as under the medical
              | context for role expectation, an equal probability distribution. Table 14 shows the
              | frequency distributions. The decision for or against job transfer was at a ratio of
              | about 1:1 at large. The labor union representative is an exception: almost all of them
              | deny a production transfer abroad (95.7%). The chi-square-test we used to
              | determine whether there is a connection between decision and role became
              | significant (Chi² = 54.10; p < .00). That means that the decision is dependent on the
              | role in the economic context.

text          | In general, the decision was dependent on the role. Only in study I in the medical
              | context, the frequency distribution was independent of it. This exception suggests
              | that all roles have the same standardization to accept gene therapy (which is
              | outlawed in Germany). Whilst this seems to be the case for role behavior, the
              | expectations against role keepers does not seem to be that strict.
              | Subject of the next paragraph was whether the frequency distributions of the
              | decisions made is dependent on the role and differs between the conditions “role
              | behavior” (study I) and “role expectation” (study II). To test this, a chi-square-test was
              | calculated. Table 15 shows a comparison of frequencies of denial and acceptance
              | between study I and II. For each context or role a single chi-square-test was
              | calculated. Observed frequencies refer to study II. Anticipated frequencies are
              | calculated on their basis and are the frequencies which would be anticipated if the
              | results of study I had been exactly replicated. This procedure was necessary to
              | adjust the different numbers of subjects and frequencies between study I and II. Data
              | and results have been written in a row in each case to save space. Frequencies
              | differed significantly between study I and II in the medical context (chi² = 21.37; p <
              | .00) and in the economic context (chi² = 122.39; p < .00). On the level of roles, only
meta          | 26
text          | two comparisons did not become significant (member of the ethics commission who
              | is affected by the decision in the medical context and labor union representative in
              | the
              | economic context). For these roles, similar standardizations seem
              | to
              | be
              | expressed in role expectations and behaviors. For the two contexts in general and
              | the other roles, expectations and behavior differed and suggest misunderstandings in
              | committees if the role is known and a specific decision expected.

              | Discussion
              | The first results of both studies refer to the ethical positions questionnaire which
              | has once again proved to be a reliable and efficient instrument for the survey of
              | ethical positions.
              | The
              | scales
              | have
              | a suitable internal consistence
              | and
              | the
meta          | 27
text          | fundamental positions of practical philosophy - hedonism, intuitionism, utilitarianism,
              | and deontology - could be confirmed via factor analysis.
              | Study I and II give evidence for the importance of all four ethical positions when it
              | comes to justifying a decision. The positions could be stated for a medical and an
              | economic context and seem plausible to be detectable on other contexts, too.
              | As regards content the studies try to answer the question if there is a connection
              | between the social role someone is holding and the decision and its justification
              | concerning an ethical problem. Thereby it was of special interest whether decisions
              | and their justifications are socially standardized. The results of the studies gave the
              | following answers:
              |  The justifications were in parts independent from the context (medical und
              | economic). Different roles showed similar patterns of justification mostly
              | independent of the context. The ethical differences were greater for role behavior
              | than role expectation. The direction of the decisions was dependent on the
              | context. Each context forwarded socially standardized decisions which were to
              | agree to gene manipulation and to deny production transfer. Social
              | standardizations were more influential for role behavior.
              |  Different social roles led to different justifications which meant social
              | standardization through roles. The effects were irregular concerning different
              | roles and different ethical positions. More differentiations and thus less
              | standardization could be stated for the economic context in the condition role
              | expectation.
              |  Social roles influenced the direction of the decisions which could be interpreted
              | as influence of social norms. An exception was role behavior in the medical
              | context: the influence of the context was more powerful and overlaid the one of
              | social roles.
              |  Differences between role behavior and role expectation could be stated. They
              | headed for the direction of greater influence of social norms in role behavior.
              | The findings have an important impact on the composition and treatment of
              | groups discussing an ethical problem, especially ethics commissions. In general, it is
              | helpful to include the role when differences in the justifications are considered. This
              | also means that it is possible to guide discussions better if the importance of ethical
              | positions for the justification of a role keeper is known. It may also be promising to
              | lead group members to take a perspective contrary to their own (Rutherford, 2004)
meta          | 28
text          | because group discussions can lead to a polarization as well as to stereotypes
              | (Brauer, Judd & Jacqueline, 2001). Especially disagreements increase stereotyping
              | (Kunda & Spencer, 2003) and can thus lead to “rigid fronts” during discussions. Role
              | keepers should be able to express the self and connect with group members
              | (Bettencourt & Sheldon, 2001; Davis, Conklin, Smith & Luce, 1996) without having
              | misguided perceptions about parties to a negotiation or conflict (Ames, 2004). If
              | different justifications can actually be found and ethical positions are variously
              | weighted, respectively, then it must be assured that not only all important positions
              | are represented (Scanlon, 1999; Schönecker, 2005) but equally considered during
              | the ethical discussion. In this way, the influence of the composition of members could
              | be decreased and the quality of the group´s performance and the finding of a
              | consensual result could become easier. Last but not least the equal consideration of
              | different ethical positions meets the demands of our value pluralistic society.
              | As to the decisions: In the condition “role behavior” (study I), the chosen contexts
              | retain socially determined decisions, independently from the roles. A great majority
              | votes for gene manipulation and against the transferring of jobs. Thereby, the ethical
              | justifications clearly differ in their importance. Individual perspectives and opinions
              | can only accomplish with special roles and problems when deciding on an ethical
              | problem. From a rational point of view the connections between decision,
              | justification, and social role should not be fixed but should be extinguished. This
              | could be done best by a process of discussing an ethical problem based on reason.
              | In the condition “role expectation” the decisions are less standardized. The
              | differences between role behavior and expectation give evidence for a
              | misunderstanding between the two perspectives. People behave in a way they mean
              | to meet the expectations linked to their roles but actually they do not meet them.
              | Again, the uncertainty concerning the “proper behavior” and the “right decision”
              | should be solved by the means of a discussion process which puts a stress on open-
              | mindedness, rationality, and balanced argumentation.
              | Further research is necessary as to the standardization of role behavior and
              | decisions. To speak with Turner and Colomy (1993) the functional, representational,
              | and tenable part of social roles should be determined in its influence. Not only further
              | evidence for the mechanisms of role standardizations is needed but also the
              | development of group procedures which are able to prevent the influence of
              | standardizations. In addition to questionnaire studies, field studies and experiments
