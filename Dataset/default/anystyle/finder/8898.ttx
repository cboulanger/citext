              | Abstract: Elite physicians have been portrayed as opposed to the use of laboratory science in the
              | hospital. In this paper John Harley WARNER's research regarding use of the terms "natural" and
              | "normal" in case notes in the U.S., as representative of the growing influence of laboratory science
              | in the hospital, is compared to use of these words at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and Adden-
              | brooke's Hospital, Cambridge, England. Discourse at Bart's appears to support the view of elite
              | opposition to the laboratory. However, the case notes reveal that the bacteriological laboratory was
              | used at least as often as at Addenbrooke's. This apparent contradiction is investigated by examin-
              | ing how the words "natural" and "normal" were used, and the reception of experimental physiology
              | at the hospitals. Samuel GEE, a physician at Bart's in the late nineteenth century, who also, at first
              | glance, had contradictory views on the use of the laboratory in the hospital, is examined through his
              | practice and writings in order to understand that representations of reception of laboratory science
              | are not straightforward. Analysing changes in language over time shows that rhetoric and practice
              | are not always aligned, and that language cannot always be seen as an indicator of the latter.

              | Elite London physicians have presented themselves as both opposed to laboratory
              | science and specialisation, and as embracing these new developments in the age
              | of the rise of laboratory biomedical sciences. Current historiography has
              | concentrated on the former representation of these elite physicians, portraying
              | them as considering medicine an art rather than a science. This case has
              | especially been put forward for the physicians at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in

              | FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,
              | London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920
              | London1. An analysis of discourse in the case notes from Bart's between 1880
              | and 1920 appears to confirm the idea that physicians were reluctant to fully
              | support the changes in ideology that experimental laboratory science brought to
              | medicine. This is especially highlighted when Bart's is compared to
              | Addenbrooke's Hospital, at the time the unofficial teaching hospital for the
              | University of Cambridge, and to hospitals in the United States of America.
              | However, the idea that elite physicians were not opposed to the laboratory has
              | recently been raised regarding the practice of elite physicians who used
              | commercial bacteriological laboratories, as only elite practitioners with wealthy
              | patients could have afforded the prices charged by these institutions
              | (WORBOYS, 2004). Looking at medical practice at Bart's confirms this view, and
              | shows that the elite physicians who worked there welcomed the new science of
              | bacteriology. [1]
              | The understanding of discourse in this paper is informed by work on the U.S..
              | One of the major findings in John Harley WARNER's (1997a) pioneering study of
              | patient records is the change of language from "natural" to "normal" over time. He
              | shows, with examples of two U.S. hospitals, that the use of the word "natural" to
              | describe a state of well-being had been "almost completely replaced" by "normal"
              | by the mid-1870s. "Natural" related to an individual's well-being, which could differ
              | with the seasons, or with ethnicity, location or sex, for example (WARNER,
              | 1997a, pp.85-86). The term "natural" refers to disease as non-specific, and as
              | "systemic imbalances in the body's natural harmony" (WARNER, 1997a, p.86)2.
              | "Normal" is a word from experimental physiology which belongs to the second
              | half of the nineteenth century, when "universalized norms defined by laboratory
              | science" became the way to consider well-being (WARNER, 1997a, pp.86-87).
              | This is reflected in the graphical and quantitative representation of temperature,
              | pulse, respiration and urinalysis—matching measurements to "normal standards"
              | (WARNER, 1997a, p.87). Machines used in experimental physiology such as the
              | kymograph recorded graphical images of the pulse or the respiration of an
              | animal, and this recording of information in a graphical form took off in clinical
              | medicine. [2]
              | 1 The physicians of Bart's are particularly well represented in Christopher LAWRENCE's (1985)
              | first article as advocates of character being highly important for the practice of medicine,
              | including Patrick BLACK, Dyce DUCKWORTH and Sir James PAGET; a high prominence for
              | Thomas HORDER in his second article on the subject, alongside Samuel GEE, Sir Percival
              | HORTON-SMITH-HARLEY, and Sir Walter LANGDON BROWN (LAWRENCE, 1998); the 1999
              | article being entirely focused on the Bart's physicians GEE, HORDER, and BROWN (LAWRENCE,
              | 1999); and the chapter of 2000 once again looking at GEE, HORDER, BROWN, the surgeon,
              | D'Arcy POWER, and even William HARVEY, amongst other examples from the London and
              | Oxford elites (LAWRENCE, 2000). In LAWRENCE's (1985, pp.516-17) first article on this topic,
              | though, Thomas Lauder BRUNTON is portrayed as an advocate of diagnostic technologies
              | such as the sphygmograph and sphygmomanometer, and fan of continental science, without
              | mentioning he was a Bart's physician. Tensions between the laboratory and elite physicians in
              | the clinic have also been examined for other countries (MAULITZ, 1979; GEISON, 1979;
              | JACYNA, 1988).
              | 2 I use the word "specificity" with the opposite meaning to WARNER. He uses "specificity" and
              | "universalism" to mean opposite ways of understanding disease. "Specificity" means
              | "individualism" for him—the specificity of the patient—whereas in my research this term is used
              | with reference to specific diseases (WARNER, 1997b).

              | London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920
              | The main sources for this study are clinical case notes from Bart's and
              | Addenbrooke's Hospitals in order to compare use of language with use of
              | bacteriological methods of diagnosis. As a sampling method, all of the existing
              | case notes for pulmonary tuberculosis, typhoid fever and diphtheria have been
              | examined from the years between 1880 and 19203. This paper challenges the
              | existing secondary literature in the field of history by using sources depicting what
              | actually happened, written at the time of these everyday events. Discourse can
              | help to reveal the mindset of the physicians, and whether they were ready for the
              | appropriation of laboratory science, and how much they believed in the worth of its
              | techniques and products. [3]
              | There will be slightly more focus on Bart's in this paper, as this is the hospital
              | which shall be shown to not fit with the pattern of the clear transition through time
              | from the use of the word "natural" to the word "normal". In order to examine the
              | differences between the hospitals I shall first examine how Bart's and
              | Addenbrooke's have been represented by historians. The creation of case notes
              | at each hospital shall be considered, and then the use of language at both of the
              | English hospitals will be compared with use of language in the U.S. Differences
              | will be considered in light of the use of laboratory sciences at the two English
              | hospitals, and the "double lives" which Bart's physicians appeared to lead,
              | focusing on Samuel GEE as an example of the latter. [4]
              | Although being linked by the theme "Time and Discourse" to the other papers in
              | this volume, this contribution is different in that it looks at change in discourse
              | over a long time period of forty years. Also, it looks at the late nineteenth and
              | early twentieth centuries whereas the other papers examine contemporary events
              | or the very recent past. However, MOREIRA and especially MOTZKAU, ground
              | their work historically. The paper also differs from almost all of the others by
              | examining the use of particular words to examine changing concepts, rather than
              | a wider framework of discourse. The use of these words is, however, analysed to
              | examine the more general change in ideology regarding the use of laboratory
              | science in medicine. There are similarities to ELGAARD JENSEN's paper, which
              | looks at a single word in examining the construction of the "future" in discourse in
              | a study of representation of a new kind of office space, analysing how this word is
              | used to persuade "witnesses" and how it is then replicated. The identity of the
              | company is constructed through this word, and in this paper on the history of
              | medicine, words are also seen to illustrate a changing identity of physicians over
              | time. Although this paper considers the discourse of a hundred years ago, one of
              | the main sources for this work overlaps with that used by other studies in this
              | volume which partly focus on documents and their creation to empirically examine
              | time and discourse, such as those by KONTOPODIS and ELGAARD JENSEN.

              | 2. St. Bartholomew's Hospital—An Elite London Institution
              | St. Bartholomew's Hospital is the oldest continually open hospital in Britain, and
              | perhaps was the most prestigious in the country between 1880 and 1920.
              | Historian of medicine, Christopher LAWRENCE, focuses on the physicians at this
              | hospital, especially in his article on the interwar years (LAWRENCE, 1998), giving
              | the impression that at this hospital the physicians would not have routinely used a
              | diagnostic laboratory with specialist pathologists diagnosing patients away from
              | the bedside (LAWRENCE, 1985; 1998; 1999; 2000). [6]
              | Roy PORTER, Jeanne PETERSON and Christopher LAWRENCE have all
              | examined how London hospital physicians differed from those in the rest of the
              | country, except perhaps Oxford. Roy PORTER (2001, p.255) describes London's
              | elite physicians of the nineteenth century as having "plush positions of professional
              | authority and eminence." One of Christopher LAWRENCE's (1985; 1998) main
              | themes in his articles on the London medical profession and their clinical practice
              | from 1850-1939, is the idea of gentility amongst the elite. He attributes this
              | mentality to the "distinguished lay governors" who selected physicians by "class
              | attributes rather than medical skill"; the importance of "character more than the
              | pursuit of expertise" (LAWRENCE, 1985, pp.503-504). Elite London physicians
              | also controlled the professional institutions, holding the highest offices of the
              | Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons (PETERSON, 1978, p.137). Jeanne
              | PETERSON (1978, p.136) perhaps best sums up the status of these physicians:
              | "Those who practiced in London hospitals and in private practice were rewarded with
              | high social connections, prosperity if not wealth, and … [the] pleasures of the upper
              | ranks of Victorian society. Knighthoods or baronetcies, country houses, lavish
              | entertaining, foreign travel, Alpine mountain-climbing, membership at the Athenaeum,
              | art collecting—all were possible for the select few who were numbered among the
              | London medical and surgical elite. They often married well, sent their sons to public
              | school and university; they owned carriages, hired servants, and donned the morning
              | coats and top hats that daily bespoke their elevated status." [7]
              | In the 1960s, the London teaching hospitals were "still the seats of power", in the
              | words of commentator Paul FERRIS (1965, pp.61-62), especially St.
              | Bartholomew's Hospital and St. Thomas's Hospital, which had the "best social
              | standing and the nicest upper-class nurses." [8]
              | Despite the eminence of the London teaching hospitals, they have not been seen
              | as the most progressive of hospitals in their use of scientific knowledge and
              | medical technology by some historians and commentators. According to
              | LAWRENCE (1985, p.507), for gentlemen physicians clinical medicine was
              | "based on science" but was an "art which necessitated that its practitioners be the
              | most cultured of men and the most experienced reflectors on the human

              | London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920
              | condition." He examines the delayed use of medical instruments such as the
              | sphygmograph and sphygmomanometer, as described in published medical
              | literature (LAWRENCE, 1985, pp.515-516). The gentlemen physicians of the
              | interwar years were apparently "anti-mechanization and standardization" due to
              | their holistic worldview (LAWRENCE, 1998, p.94). The London teaching hospitals
              | of the 1960s were still "stiff with protocol, old-fashioned and due to lose their grip
              | on the central mysteries of medicine" (FERRIS, 1965, p.62). FERRIS (1965,
              | p.64) wrote:
              | "Medicine as a whole is becoming so complex that the individual performer will soon
              | seem an archaic figure, mumbling the magic formula, 'bedside medicine,' obsessed
              | with the gentlemanliness of his profession. But the London system is still rooted in
              | this archaic individualism of the part-time gentleman." [9]
              | LAWRENCE (1998, p.95) considers that the interwar gentlemen physicians
              | approved of the laboratory for diagnostic and experimental purposes but "were
              | determined to integrate it into their preferred social order"—an order which
              | opposed specialisation. Apparently, physicians like St. Bartholomew's Thomas
              | HORDER believed that all clinical pathology should be carried out by the clinician
              | himself, and Sir Walter LANGDON-BROWN worried about the division of labour
              | in society in general (LAWRENCE, 1998, pp.98 and 105). Joel D. HOWELL
              | (1987, p.58), who has examined the use of technology in the hospital in the U.S.,
              | considers that in the early twentieth century, British physicians as a whole did not
              | accept "[t]he bacteriologist and his gram stains; the physiologist and his
              | kymograph" as part of "normal" clinical medicine, and that these techniques were
              | for "training purposes in an academic setting." Apparently specialisation in
              | medicine was also not accepted throughout the country (HOWELL, 1987, p.59).
              | This appears to be the current prevailing view in the secondary literature, and
              | partly so in the physicians' published primary literature. [10]
              | 3. Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge—Unofficial Teaching Hospital
              | to a Medieval University
              | At the beginning of the period of this study, the University of Cambridge's
              | department of Medicine was developing a reputation to rival the London medical
              | schools. The status of the school had been very low in the early nineteenth
              | century. From 1833 to 1858 an average of less than four students per year
              | studied Medicine at the University, and the qualification obtained was not highly
              | regarded within the medical profession (ROOK, CARLTON & CANNON, 1991,
              | pp.118-119). Medical journals compared Cambridge unfavourably with the
              | London medical schools with regard to size of hospitals and lack of dissecting
              | rooms (WEATHERALL, 2000, p.15). However, bedside clinical instruction had
              | been given to Cambridge medical students from 1819 (WEATHERALL, 2000,
              | p.63). By the late nineteenth century the reputation of the school had changed
              | with 70 students joining the medical course in 1880 (WEATHERALL, 2000,
              | p.110) and Cambridge having one of the largest medical schools in the country
              | by 1891. At this time the degree was regarded as "one of the highest professional
              | qualifications" (ROOK et al., 1991, pp.118-119). However, Addenbrooke's

              | London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920
              | Hospital continued to be too small to cope with all the medical students for their
              | whole degree, so London hospitals, amongst others, were used for student
              | placements during the late nineteenth century (WEATHERALL, 2000, p.131).
              | According to WEATHERALL (2000, p.116), the aim of the Cambridge medical
              | school was to attract physicians who had "clinical ability and scientific curiosity"—
              | people like John BRADBURY who was Physician to Addenbrooke's for fifty years
              | and who also published on pathological and clinical subjects in the BMJ and the
              | Lancet. Cambridge is also an interesting case to study in comparison to Bart's, as
              | Gerald GEISON (1978, pp.9, 81 and 96) considers that Cambridge was a
              | university in transition from the 1870s. University professors were taking their
              | jobs more seriously, considering an academic career could be for life, and both
              | transmitting and producing knowledge. He demonstrates this changing
              | environment by linking the growth of Michael FOSTER's physiological school with
              | that of the rise of the Cavendish Laboratory for physics. He considers that without
              | this change at Cambridge, English physiology would have been very different
              | (GEISON, 1978, p.47). In suggesting that biology in Cambridge would have been
              | transformed by George HUMPHRY, the surgeon, if FOSTER had not come to
              | Cambridge, GEISON (1978, p.123) shows that he considers that the town and
              | university were perhaps more important than the person. Therefore, the general
              | milieu in Cambridge in the late nineteenth century with regard to laboratory
              | science is very important to consider when examining changing discourse and
              | practice. [11]
              | The connection between the University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's
              | Hospital appeared assured as, from 1785, it had been the tradition that a
              | physician at Addenbrooke's Hospital was appointed the Regius Professor of
              | Physic at Cambridge (ROOK et al., 1991, p.238)4. Other physicians at the
              | hospital included Downing Professors of Medicine, Fellows of various colleges
              | and one Lucasian Professor of Mathematics (ROOK et al., pp.60, 61, 83, 85,
              | 101). However, when Clifford ALLBUTT (a supporter of the value of experimental
              | science for the practice of medicine) was appointed as the Regius Professor in
              | 1892, this relationship came into question. Clifford ALLBUTT was, according to
              | Sir Walter LANGDON-BROWN, appointed as it was too hard to choose between
              | the three physicians at Addenbrooke's (ROOK et al., 1991, p.238)5. ALLBUTT
              | was not to receive a position at the Hospital until 1900, although he did deputise
              | for Dr Donald MACALISTER in the summers of 1896-97 (ROOK et al., 1991,
              | p.247). In 1895, the Vice Chancellor asked the Hospital for a conference to
              | establish "a closer and more regular connexion between the Hospital and the
              | University Teachers in the Department of Medicine." All members of staff at the
              | Hospital, except one, were also professors or teachers at the university, and
              | clinical lectures were given in the wards, the Board Room, and the Operating
              | Theatre, but there was still no official link (ROOK et al., 1991, pp.238-239). In
              | 1896, it was agreed in the Committee that Lecturers could use the hospital, and
              | 4 The hospital was opened in 1766, with the Regius Professor of Physic, Russell PLUMPTRE, as
              | a physician to Addenbrooke's (ROOK et al., 1991, p.58). So there must only have been a small
              | gap when the Regius Professor incumbent was not physician to the hospital.

              | was agreed that the University would pay the hospital £300 per year, and the
              | Regius Professor could be a Physician, with the Professor choosing whether he
              | would like beds to supervise, or whether he would only like them for teaching
              | purposes. ALLBUTT declined the offer of beds to supervise, telling the Hospital
              | he already had enough for teaching purposes (ROOK et al., 1991, p.248). He did
              | not take over the care of any beds until staff shortages during the First World
              | War (ROOK et al., 1991, p.315). However, the links between the hospital and the
              | university were also practical in the nature of diagnosis of patients.
              | Addenbrooke's' X-rays were initially carried out at the Cavendish Laboratory, by
              | members of staff there—Mr. W.H. HAYLES and Mr. EVERETT—as early as
              | 1896. Indeed, Mr. HAYLES was, according to some Cambridge medical
              | historians, probably the "first man in England to take an X-ray" (ROOK et al.,
              | 1991, p.332). Addenbrooke's got its own machine in 1903, firstly with surgeons
              | unsuccessfully taking their own photographs, and subsequently in 1907 with Mr.
              | FIELD, the dispenser, learning how to use it from staff at Bart's. This is
              | interesting considering the view discussed earlier of Bart's and technological
              | instruments (ROOK et al., 1991, p.332). The Hospital and University were also
              | closely connected in geographical terms. In the late nineteenth century,
              | Addenbrooke's Hospital and the New Museums site, which began construction in
              | 1863, were closely situated in Cambridge (WEATHERALL, 2000, p.98). The
              | location of the Cavendish Laboratory on Free School Lane would have enabled
              | close interaction between Hospital and University.

              | consultation in the proposed election of a professor for physiology at Trinity
              | College and how this typified the importance given to natural sciences compared
              | to medicine (GEISON, 1978, p.108)6. In 1883-4, the scientists at the University
              | were officially given more power than the physicians who had positions at the
              | University. A university-wide decision was made to give more power in decision-
              | making to residents of the University, as opposed to non-residents. This meant
              | that the Board of Medicine came to have a clear majority of pre-clinical scientists,
              | and led to the first Professor of Pathology, Charles Smart ROY, being a
              | physiological pathologist, rather than a clinical pathologist (WEATHERALL, 2000,
              | pp.133 and 139)7. The Lancet announced at the news of this appointment that it
              | would "blight the hopes of those who were looking forward to the establishment of
              | a practical medicine school at Cambridge" for ROY was really an experimental
              | physiologist (WEATHERALL, 2000, p.143)8. GEISON (1978, pp.365-366)
              | considers that FOSTER had a key part to play in the appointment of Clifford
              | ALLBUTT. This loss of control of Medicine in the University angered the
              | physicians at Addenbrooke's and perhaps contributed to the delay in ALLBUTT
              | being accepted at the Hospital (WEATHERALL, 2000, p.189). [13]
              | 4. Life on the Wards
              | From the clinical records at Bart's it is clear that the internal medicine case notes
              | were not actually completed by the physicians examined in this paper, but by
              | clinical clerks. Their names always begin with "Mr." rather than "Dr." in the
              | internal medicine case notes. However, there are indicators that the physicians
              | had a heavy influence on the case notes. Geoffrey BOURNE (1963, pp.35 and
              | 123), a student and subsequently physician at Bart's, has written an
              | autobiography which tells in detail the procedures followed. The "Clinical Clerks"
              | mentioned in the case notes were medical students in the clinical years of their
              | degree. Clerking involved taking histories and physical examinations. Physicians
              | were involved in this process though. BOURNE describes how John DRYSDALE
              | led students to describe the condition of the patient through his "Socratic method
              | of careful questioning", and then led them through "examination, inspection,
              | palpation, percussion and auscultation." These notes were read out to the
              | consultants and were criticised by them as to length, content, and style of writing
              | and language (BOURNE, 1963, pp.36-37 and 78). [14]
              | In a couple of instances in the casebooks, physicians' involvement is illustrated.
              | For example, physicians signed requests for the pathologist to undertake a
              | Widal's test (invented in 1896). This is in the same case book, in 1898, but
              | signed by two different doctors—CHURCH and MOORE (SBH 16/41/141;
              | 16/41/181). There are common characteristics in case notes supervised by the
              | 6 The professorship was not created at this time due to agricultural depression lowering Trinity
              | College's income (GEISON, 1978, p.108).
              | 7 The vote was actually tied between ROY and the clinical pathologist, David James HAMILTON,
              | but the Vice Chancellor of the University showed where his allegiance lay, voting for ROY
              | (WEATHERALL, 2000, pp.139-140).

              | Illustration 2: Symbol for Typhoid [15]
              | The symbol was used frequently in 1893 (in five out of ten cases) and in 1897 (in
              | two out of four cases). The phrase "Typhoides Febris" was only used under the
              | care of Dr. TOOTH for all three cases examined on his ward in 1911 and 1913
              | (SBH 16/39 and 16/43). This again shows the influence of physicians on their
              | clerks' notes, as it happened over three years. It seems, judging by handwriting,
              | that Samuel GEE wrote part or all of 69 out of 90 sets of case notes between
              | 1882 and 18999. [16]
              | The case notes for Addenbrooke's Hospital are not uniform like those at Bart's.
              | Case notes from Bart's are almost always complete and include in order a front
              | sheet with the patient's personal details and a summary of the case and usually a
              | diagnosis, the notes taken during the patient's stay, graphs documenting
              | temperature with accompanying charts with information about urinalysis, for
              | example, and a sheet detailing diet and treatments prescribed. Later, extra pages
              | such as pathology and X-ray reports were included. These are not in specific
              | places in the notes. Addenbrooke's case notes contain similar sources of
              | information, but on many occasions they are not all present. Addenbrooke's case
              | notes are signed by "House physicians" rather than "clinical clerks". It appears
              | that either standards and expectations of completion of case notes were much
              | higher at Bart's, or that students were more conscientious than junior doctors
              | when completing case notes in order to impress their teachers and pass their
              | degree. The influence which physicians had on students' notes at Bart's may
              | mean they show a previous generation's views when compared to notes compiled
              | by junior doctors at Addenbrooke's. [17]
              | 5. Science and Standardisation: Exploring the Mindset of the
              | Gentlemen Physicians
              | WARNER shows the transition from "natural" to "normal" with his study of the
              | records of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Commercial Hospital of
              | Cincinnati. WARNER's (1997a, pp.104 and 113) sample of cases—about 4000—
              | compared to the 405 cases examined at Bart's and 1418 at Addenbrooke's is
              | more significant for trends. However, there are noticeable differences which can
              | be seen between St. Bartholomew's Hospital and the two hospitals in the U.S..
              | Illustration 3 shows the percentages of cases in which WARNER found these two
              | words at each hospital.

              | handwriting from looking through his private casebooks which are discussed later in this paper. I
              | have not attempted this kind of analysis for any other physician as I do not have enough
              | familiarity with their handwriting.

              | years of the four decades shown. As "natural" and "normal" were used

              | profitable.

              | Illustration 5 shows the percentages of cases in which either "natural" or "normal"
              | were used the most, revealing that "natural" was more predominant in use than
              | "normal" throughout most of the period. WARNER considers that the use of
              | language in medical records reflects the change in "cognition" of the physicians.
              | Although the sample is small compared to WARNER's, the word natural was
              | evidently very much in use at Bart's throughout the period 1880-1920, indicating
              | that medical practice would, like language, not be affected as much as other
              | hospitals by new scientific knowledge produced in the laboratory. [21]
              | At Addenbrooke's, as would be expected with the influences the hospital had
              | from the University of Cambridge, "normal" superseded "natural" from an early
              | stage, as shown in Illustrations 6 and 7.

              | "Natural" and "normal" were often written close together in case notes, even for
              | the same types of descriptions. For example, in an Addenbrooke's' case note it was
              | written in 1902, "Cor. natural and in normal position" (AH 025/8-9/208). A Bart's'
              | case note states in 1896, "Knee jerks nat." and then in the same handwriting the
              | next day, with only two lines in between, it was written, "Knee jerks normal" (SBH
              | 16/042/028). This could be used to question the change in use of "natural" and

              | "normal," especially for Bart's where both terms were used commonly until 1920.
              | However, often the way in which both terms were used in the same case note
              | was when there was a reference to the temperature being normal. WARNER
              | (1997a, pp.89-90) found in U.S. case notes that quantitative measurements were
              | described as "normal" before qualitative descriptions. This was especially the
              | case for evidence gained using instruments such as the "stethoscope,
              | thermometer, or time-piece". [23]
              | Illustration 8 shows the proportion of case notes in which temperature is referred
              | to as either "natural" or "normal". As I have counted the total number of times
              | each term is used in each case note, the result is sometimes above one hundred
              | per cent—therefore this is a relative representation of the use of "natural" and

              | that temperature was nearly always referred to as "normal" at Bart's.

              | At Addenbrooke's temperature was never referred to as "natural" in the sample
              | case notes. This use of the term "normal" for a quantitative measure correlates
              | with WARNER's study. However, Bart's does not follow the same pattern when
              | heart sounds are examined (Illustration 9):

              | However, at Addenbrooke's doctors used predominantly "normal" to describe
              | heart sounds, right from the beginning of the period, and exclusively so from
              | 1907. Therefore, the relationship between language and possibly quantitative
              | measures at Bart's is not simple. However, surely temperature is easier to
              | consider as "normal" than heart sounds, as there was a set figure in the graphs in
              | the case notes determined as normal, with a printed line drawn across at that
              | point. [26]
              | The way in which a qualitative, subjective description of organs or parts of the
              | body (such as shape, position, what was palpable) was made demonstrates that
              | Bart's staff and students used "natural" for this type of assessment (Illustration 10):

              | This analysis of the way in which "natural" and "normal" were used in general,

              | 6. Experimental Physiology and Bacteriology—The Laboratory and
              | Clinical Practice
              | WARNER (1997a, pp.5-6, 85-7) framed the change from "natural" to "normal" as
              | coinciding with the gradual growth of experimental physiology as a model science
              | for medicine. The use of therapeutics changed from acting on the body as a
              | whole to restore the patient's individual "natural" balance, to working on specific
              | parts of the body in line with knowledge gained from experimental physiology,
              | with the aim of returning the body to universalised "measured, quantified norms"
              | determined or influenced by the laboratory. The influence of experimental
              | physiology may point to why changes in language were so different at
              | Addenbrooke's than at Bart's. [30]
              | Mid to late nineteenth century German experimental physiology is associated with
              | "biophysics" and the use of instruments (and also chemistry), sometimes
              | resulting in graphical representation such as the recording of the pulse by the
              | kymograph and sphygmograph (CRANEFIELD, 1957, p.407; FRANK, 1988,
              | pp.215-16). This influence can clearly be seen in the case notes of the two
              | English hospitals, where it is unusual for there to not be a graph in each case file
              | showing temperature in the period examined in this paper. Chemical assaying, of
              | urine for example, also showed the influence of chemical physiology. By the late
              | nineteenth century, the University of Cambridge was arguably the "leading center
              | of physiological research in England, if not the world" (GEISON, 1978, pp.183-4).
              | The style of experimental physiology was not perhaps as exacting as in Germany,
              | with less emphasis on graphical representation, and more on the senses. In
              | 1874, however, FOSTER did receive money for recording apparatus for his
              | laboratory which GEISON (1978, p.106) speculates was a kymograph.
              | GASKELL, one of Foster's protégés, spent a year working with LUDWIG in 1874,
              | the man who chiefly created the kymograph, and other students from Cambridge
              | spent time in German laboratories (GEISON, 1978, pp.180-3 and 253). GEISON
              | (1978, pp.253-6) discusses GASKELL's work on vaso-motor action and its
              | continuation on his return to Cambridge, comparing the "Leipzig method" with the
              | "Cambridge method". In Leipzig, under LUDWIG, GASKELL had conducted
              | experiments using a larger dog, and the kymograph for measurement of blood
              | flow, whereas in Cambridge he used the smaller frog ("as if in imitation of his
              | smaller and less elaborate surroundings") and used the "Cambridge method" of a
              | micrometer eyepiece for direct measurement of arterial diameters. GASKELL did
              | later use the kymograph in Cambridge, though, in an experiment on the heart of a
              | tortoise in 1883 (GEISON, 1978, p.295). However, the importance of
              | experimental physiology in general and the numbers of students educated in its
              | methods may have had an impact on the use of vocabulary at Addenbrooke's
              | Hospital. Huge numbers of students studied elementary physiology, with an
              | intake of 130 in 1885, and 190 in 1889 (GEISON, 1978, pp.306 and 308).

              | FOSTER, HUMPHRY, and ALLBUTT at Cambridge thought it was preferable to
              | the old system of students going straight from the mathematical tripos to clinical
              | studies, for students to have training in pre-clinical natural sciences, with
              | FOSTER thinking they should undertake the natural sciences tripos including
              | physiology (GEISON, 1978, pp.365-6). [31]
              | Practical physiology teaching in England began in the late 1860s, with FOSTER's
              | elective course at University College London (GEISON, 1978, p.330). England in
              | general did not at all compete with German "biophysics". FOSTER remembered
              | his mentor, William SHARPEY, at University College London, having to use a
              | cylinder hat to explain the kymograph in the 1850s (GEISON, 1978, p.56). In
              | 1870 the Royal College of Surgeons introduced a requirement that thirty classes
              | of "practical" anatomy and physiology should be a requirement of the licentiate,
              | with students themselves partaking in experiments, and the University of London
              | adopted this requirement in 1871 (GEISON, 1978, pp.329). GEISON considers
              | this development led to the growth of physiology in Britain (GEISON, 1978,
              | pp.150-1). The discipline of physiology in Britain as a whole expanded between
              | 1870 and 1900, at least arresting the flow of physiologists to the Continent
              | (GEISON, 1978, p.150). [32]
              | Keir WADDINGTON (2003, pp.125-6) has presented physiology at Bart's as
              | being taught reluctantly10. However, many of the initial problems which physiology
              | faced were also present in Cambridge, such as lack of space for students
              | (GEISON, 1978, pp.171-2). Although Bart's did not have the reputation of the
              | Cambridge school of physiology, Thomas Lauder BRUNTON was very
              | enthusiastic about experimental pharmacology and physiology, publishing widely,
              | and working on treatments which had practical applications such as the action of
              | digitalis. Like contemporaries at Cambridge, he spent time at the University
              | College London laboratories, and in laboratories in Vienna, Berlin and at
              | LUDWIG's laboratory in Leipzig in the early 1870s. However, rather than
              | specialising in experimental physiology like GASKELL, he combined research
              | with hospital medicine (WHITE FRANKLIN, 1974, pp.180-83; LAWRENCE, 1985,
              | pp.516-17). Therefore, the impact of physiology at Bart's is not straightforward
              | and requires further investigation, but no doubt did not have the same influence
              | on medical practice as the famous laboratory at Cambridge. [33]
              | Bacteriology, and its forerunners from the 1840s (ideas of "specific chemical,
              | fungal, and animalcular causes of disease"), also had an effect on ideas of
              | universalised and specific disease causation (WARNER, 1997a, p.87). Examining
              | use of bacteriological laboratory techniques shows different pictures of the
              | reception of experimental science at Bart's and Addenbrooke's. [34]
              | Contrary to use of language, bacteriological methods can be shown to have been
              | accepted slightly more enthusiastically at Bart's than at Addenbrooke's. For
              | typhoid fever, the diagnostic Widal's test was discovered in 1896. This
              | 10 WADDINGTON (2003, p.131) also presents bacteriology as being negatively received at Bart's
              | in the 1880s and presents a picture of Samuel GEE being opposed to the use of the laboratory, so
              | it is worth reconsidering his representation of the reception of experimental physiology at Bart's.

              | London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920
              | agglutination test was widely used from 1898 at Bart's, with it being documented
              | in all of the eight surviving case notes from 1898, and thereafter regularly used in
              | surviving case files, only for one year in 1902 dropping below 60 per cent of
              | cases. The bacteriological test for pulmonary tuberculosis, of looking for tubercle
              | bacilli in sputa, was not used as routinely as the test for typhoid, though it was still
              | used regularly. It was probably not used as often due to fairly effective existing
              | methods of percussion and auscultation. The most convincing of the sample
              | diseases for illustrating routine use of the bacteriological laboratory at Bart's is
              | diphtheria. There was a slow acceptance of the bacteriological examination for
              | diphtheria (the bacillus was isolated in 1883) due to widely acknowledged
              | problems with reliability and staining (HAMMONDS, 1999, pp.50-52;
              | ANDREWES, 1928, p.116). However, by 1896 it was routine, with 72 out of 84
              | surviving case notes showing patients received the test11. This evidence leads to
              | the question of whether discourse does show change in cognition and calls for
              | further analysis of practice and rhetoric at Bart's. The following detailed study of a
              | Bart's physician may help to illuminate why discourse was so different from
              | practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. [35]
              | 7. Double Lives?—Samuel GEE
              | The concept of "double lives" can be used as a device to try to understand why
              | physicians' images were presented differently at different times, and why practice
              | was different to language at Bart's. Samuel GEE is an ideal character to use as a
              | case study as his representation in the secondary literature, and in the extracts of
              | his own writings used within this, shows him to be apparently leading a
              | completely different life to that shown by his medical practice on the wards at
              | Bart's. [36]
              | Samuel GEE began his professional career at Bart's in 1870, becoming a full
              | physician in 1878. He was Physician to the Prince of Wales from 1901. With his
              | Headmasters' Conference school education at University College School, a
              | London medical education, his interest in the history of medicine and a position in
              | the royal household, GEE was a gentleman physician in LAWRENCE and
              | PETERSON's definitions (BROWN, 1955, pp.183-4). [37]
              | GEE has been portrayed as an advocate of medicine as an art. Indeed,
              | LAWRENCE (1998, p.96) quotes him as saying, "When you enter my wards your
              | first duty is to forget all your physiology. Physiology is an experimental science—
              | and a very good thing no doubt in its proper place. Medicine is not a science, but
              | an empirical art"12. [38]
              | GEE "declined the honour of delivering the Harveian Oration at the Royal College
              | of Physicians due to his disapproval of HARVEY's injunction to 'search and study
              | out the secrets of nature by way of experiment'" (BODLEY SCOTT, 1974, p.185).
              | 11 The STATISTICAL REPORT (1896) shows that there were 92 cases of diphtheria admitted in
              | 1896, so this is a very indicative sample.

              | As well as apparently being against laboratory science at the bedside (he was not
              | opposed to physiology as a subject in its own right), he was quoted as being
              | opposed to specialisation, proclaiming, "There is a name that I hate, yea there
              | are two names that my soul abhoreth, the name of specialist and the name of a
              | consultant" (BODLEY SCOTT, 1974, p.186)13. [39]
              | However, evidence from the clinical case notes from GEE's wards show that his
              | patients received diagnostic assistance from the laboratory, therefore using
              | experimental science performed by a specialist. Pathology had become
              | specialised from 1893, when a full-time lecturer in pathology was appointed who
              | lay the foundations of the Pathology Department during his four years at Bart's
              | (WADDINGTON, 2003, p.117). GEE's patients were diagnosed with Widal's tests
              | in six out of seven surviving typhoid records in 1899 (these are his earliest and
              | only case files surviving after the discovery of the Widal's test). This shows an
              | early and convincing acceptance of the worth of Widal's testing in cases of
              | typhoid fever, which completely contradicts GEE's public image. For pulmonary
              | tuberculosis and diphtheria, GEE's patients also increasingly received
              | bacteriological laboratory tests from 1894-6. [40]
              | GEE's private notebooks show his use and opinions of bacteriology. These
              | notebooks include notes from other authors, his own aphorisms, and also
              | selected transcriptions of his case notes. In his extracts from case notes, it can
              | also be seen that GEE (MS36, pp.135-6, 305 and 306) used the bacteriological
              | laboratory for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis between 1885 and 1891. [41]
              | GEE did not keep his use of the bacteriological laboratory secret. As well as
              | carrying signs that GEE thought of medicine as an art, his Medical Lectures and
              | Aphorisms, which went through at least four editions, includes the following
              | examples of his use of bacteriology: GEE (1915a, p.74) included in an
              | assessment of a case of chronic pituitous catarrh, read in front of the Royal
              | College of Physicians, that "[t]ubercle Bacilli were not found." In discussing diag-
              | nosis of Bronchitis and Pulmonary Tuberculosis in the same lecture he mentioned
              | the problems sometimes encountered using auscultation, but "since KOCH's
              | discovery of the tubercle bacillus we have a potent auxiliary to diagnosis in the
              | microscopic examination of the sputa" (GEE, 1915a, p.91). In his Aphorisms GEE
              | (1915b, pp.244 and 266) said of cavernous bronchial breathing, that if it was
              | caused by "tuberculous disease … discovery of tubercle bacilli would confirm it",
              | and again concerning phthisis, that amongst all the methods of diagnosis, the
              | most important was, "above all, detection of tubercle bacilli in the sputa". He even
              | advised his medical students to tell patients suspected of being "phthisical" to
              | "[s]ave your sputa to be tested (for bacilli)" (GEE, 1915b, p.246). Concerning
              | typhoid accompanied by delirium, he considered that "testing the blood by
              | cultivations of typhoid bacilli (Widal's test) must be employed as an additional
              | means of diagnosis" (GEE, 1915b, pp.290-291). He also said, comparing himself
              | with the empirical physician, in front of the Abernethian Society at Bart's in 1889, "I
              | am ready to accept help from any source, from physiology and pharmacology, but
              | 13 See a similar comment in his private notebook (GEE, MS36, p.345).

              | He wrote a very similar comment privately, showing his conviction about the worth
              | of other disciplines (GEE, MS34, pp.123-4). In discussing the process of the
              | lungs becoming emphysematous, in a lecture to the Royal College of Physicians,

              | GEE was not frightened to discuss its worth in front of eminent audiences. [43]
              | GEE's advocacy of opposing ideas was part of his personality. LEGG (1915,
              | p.359) wrote that "GEE's character was exceedingly complex, and it is very
              | difficult to unravel." GEE (1915c, pp.216 and 229; MS35, p.241) wrote publicly
              | and privately about his dislike of dogmatism. In spite of these attacks on
              | dogmatism, GEE (1915c, p.236) had a "kindly feeling" towards the "Empiric sect",
              | which was, apparently, although in his category of dogmatic sects, "much less
              | dogmatic" than his other examples. GEE is not the glowing example of an
              | advocate of empiricism which he has been portrayed as though, as he states that
              | "the empiric … is the ant which gathers facts but does not transmute them … his
              | harvests are scanty. Well for him that all physicians are not empirics" (GEE,
              | 1915c, pp.239-40)14. Indeed, LEGG (1915, p.363) considered GEE a sceptic15.
              | GEE's lack of conviction about anything is demonstrated by LEGG's recollection
              | that GEE's
              | "opinions on one subject, books or men, rarely last the same for any time. One would
              | have talk with him, and a fortnight after resume the conversation at the point where it
              | was left off and then it would be found that the whole tone of his thought had
              | changed" (LEGG, 1915, p.380). [44]
              | Indeed, his aphoristic style of writing, privately, and publicly in HORDER's
              | collection of his aphorisms, is perfect for GEE's undogmatic and eclectic way of
              | thinking. GEE wrote privately, "[t]he advantage of the aphoristic way of writing is
              | that no pretence of completeness is made; facts may be added without
              | disarranging the structure" (GEE, MS34, p.124). GEE (MS34, pp.126 and 140-
              | 141) also doubted the reliability of new "facts", and wrote twice about this problem
              | in his notebook. [45]
              | This doubt in GEE's thinking helps to explain why he may have been slightly
              | reticent about the new experimental sciences infiltrating clinical medicine. He
              | appears to have considered many innovations and new ideas, not accepting any
              | belief in particular. He did not wholly accept empiricism or experimental science.
              | LEGG's (1915, p.363) comment, "[t]hough he knew so much, yet his scepticism
              | was very deep" sums up what is clear about GEE—he was interested in
              | 14 See LAWRENCE (2000, pp.47-49) for GEE being represented as "revering" empiricism.
              | 15 This is in GEE's opposing group to dogmatism (GEE, 1915c, p.242).

              | London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920
              | everything, accepted ideas and technologies on his own terms, and was ready to
              | change his mind. [46]
              | Not surprisingly, GEE's discourse in his case notes was as complex as his
              | writings and medical practice. In case notes supervised or written by him,
              | "natural" and "normal" were used fairly equally in the 1880s and 1890s. However,
              | use of "normal" for temperature far outweighed use for qualitative descriptions of
              | organs and parts of the body. Therefore, GEE's notes are representative of
              | patterns of use of language at Bart's in general. [47]
              | Recently, Lorraine DASTON and H. Otto SIBUM (2003) have discussed the
              | possibility of scientists, and people in general, having different personae
              | depending on the context. However, the traditional idea of double lives considers
              | people have secrets to hide (GOFFMAN, 1969, especially Chapter 4). The case
              | study of GEE questions this idea, showing that he did not hide his use of
              | bacteriology. However, in this paper the use of the concept of "double lives" is a
              | heuristic device in order to examine how gentlemen physicians were able to
              | integrate the specialist laboratory into their clinical practice. The way in which
              | GEE presented ways of using bacteriology to eminent audiences demonstrates
              | that this was entirely possible. [48]
              | Part of the confusion regarding GEE's attitude towards experimental science may
              | stem from his self-representation in the wards. In one of his notebooks, GEE
              | (MS34, p.169) wrote:
              | "Always remember that the work in the Wards, so far as students are concerned, is
              | simply the education of their senses. Pathology they can read at home. Waste no
              | time over it. The pulse is dicrotous. What does dicrotism signify? Never mind, feel
              | that it is dicrotous, + when you get home refer to your books." [49]
              | GEE may have given people the impression that laboratory science was not
              | important to him by not "wasting time" discussing it on the wards. [50]
              | Gentlemen physicians may have presented various images of themselves in
              | order to defend their profession. Diagnosis was perhaps the most important
              | technique for a physician. Thomas HORDER and his colleague at Bart's, A.E.
              | GOW (1952, p.xiii), considered diagnosis was the "be-all and the end-all" of
              | medicine. Bacteriology was quite a threat to physicians, as their major role was
              | being challenged (MAULITZ, 1979, p.92)16. There was reason for the physicians to
              | be cautious about the impact of bacteriology, in order to defend their status. [51]
              | In the 1920s and '30s, HORDER (1937a, p.32; HORDER, 1937b, pp.174-5 and
              | 181) seems to have been worried about the profession of the clinician due to the
              | attitude of the public. In his experience, patients were growing increasingly
              | convinced of the power of machines and experts. In 1924 he remarked on how
              | 16 LAWRENCE (1999, p.427) comments on diagnosis as the "cornerstone of medicine", repeated
              | in LAWRENCE (2000, p.49). HAMMONDS (1999, p.11) also considers that change in
              | diagnostic practices of diphtheria was seen as a threat to the medical profession of New York.

              | London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920
              | lay people were treating doctors as though they had "no expert knowledge
              | whatever", putting forward ideas such as possible causes of cancer (HORDER,
              | 1924, p.822). Patients were coming to see him armed with X-rays and ideas
              | about the reasons for their illnesses (HORDER, 1937b, p.183). He defended his
              | profession, stressing the importance of "human judgment" (HORDER, 1937b,
              | p.174). Patients were coming to him having already had diagnostic tests to save
              | time and money. One patient would not allow HORDER to even examine him,
              | saying, "please give me something for my headache: I don't want a diagnosis, it
              | costs too much" (HORDER, 1937b, p.184). [52]
              | Professionally, however, the position of pathologist was not as grand as being a
              | physician. Indeed, ANDREWES (1928, p.116) expected to become a physician at
              | Bart's as he already held a position at the Royal Free Hospital. Giving this up was
              | "a big change in one's life", but he realised he "loved laboratory work more than
              | Out-Patients." The income of a pathologist was much lower than that of a hospital
              | physician. Although the physicians had campaigned for £600 a year for the Bart's
              | pathologist, he only received £100 with no time for private practice. The physi-
              | cians were paid under 100 guineas at Bart's, but through private practice they
              | could achieve huge salaries (SBH Ha 6/5 1895; SBH Ha 1/27 1895). The Bart's
              | practitioners, Sir James PAGET and John ABERNETHY, from earlier in the
              | nineteenth century, earned in excess of £10,000 a year at their peak (WADDING-
              | TON, 1984, p.32). In a meeting between the Treasurer and the Medical Council
              | at Bart's in 1895, the Treasurer said regarding the Medical Council's proposed
              | salary for the Pathologist, "[o]f course £600 a year is not a large or even an
              | adequate payment, but still all that class of work is not highly paid" (SBH Ha 6/5
              | 1895). So, this low status of the bacteriologist shows why the physicians may
              | have thought it safe to discuss the value of bacteriology in public. [53]
              | 8. Conclusion
              | Case notes have been shown in this paper to have considerable worth in
              | discovering what actually happened everyday in the life of the elite London
              | hospital in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. They reveal the
              | change in rhetoric used in the hospital over time, and what this may have
              | indicated for the "double life" of the physician—conflicted between the old world
              | of bedside medicine and the new world of the laboratory, and holding onto the old
              | world by continuing to use its language. [54]
              | Although Addenbrooke's Hospital was more similar to the U.S. in its reception of
              | the laboratory, "natural" was still used more frequently at later dates than in the
              | U.S. The difference in the domination of the term "normal" in Cambridge from the
              | U.S. deserves further investigation, especially due to the prominence of
              | experimental physiology in Cambridge. Differences between Bart's, and
              | Addenbrooke's and the U.S., can be explained more easily. Older physicians had
              | more of an influence on the creation of case notes at Bart's, the reputation of
              | physiology teaching and research did not rival Cambridge, and the examination of
              | GEE shows that medical practice was perhaps torn between an old and a new
              | world for medicine, with physicians wanting to utilise the laboratory for the benefit

              | of their practice, but perhaps afraid of the threat to their profession. It may also
              | simply be that at Bart's there was a cognitive distinction between a quantifiable
              | measure and a qualitative description meaning that though temperature was
              | almost universally described as "normal", organs and features such as colour
              | were not. This distinction can be further supported as the use of bacteriological
              | methods was enthusiastically received so there was not an opposition to
              | laboratory science. [55]
              | An examination of case notes based on language alone would represent Bart's as
              | reluctant to accept the fruits of the experimental laboratory. So, at first glance,
              | language does not mirror practice. However, using cluster analysis, especially of
              | temperature, this is shown not to be the case, and perhaps this slight
              | conservatism regarding language at Bart's relates to the confusing
              | representations of the gentlemen physicians torn between a world based on
              | bedside experience and one based on experimental science. [56]
