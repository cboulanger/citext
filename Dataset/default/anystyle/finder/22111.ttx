              | Abstract
              | F
              | We oconsider a non-stationary regression type model for stock returns in which the
              | innovations are described by four-parameter distributions and the parameters are as-
              | sumed to be rsmooth, deterministic functions of time. Incorporating also normal distri-
              | butions for modelling the innovations, our model is capable of adapting to light-tailed
              | innovations as wPellas to heavy-tailed ones. Thus, it turns out to be a very exible
              | e
              | approach. Both, for the tting of the model and for forecasting the distributions of
              | future returns, we use local likelihood methods for estimation of the parameters. We
              | apply our model to the S&eP500 return series, observed over a period of twelve years.
              | We show that it ts these datraquite well and that it yields reasonable one-day-ahead
              | forecasts.

              | O
              | During the past twenty years remarkable e orts were made to develop and investigate models
              | n
              | for time series of stock returns, i.e. for time series Xt = log(Pt=Pt 1), t = 1; : : : ; n, where
              | Pt represents the price of a stock (or a stock index) at time t. In doing so the ARCH and
              | GARCH models of Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986) were in the centrleof interest. The
              | basic GARCH(p; q) model takes the form y
              | (1.1)
              | Xt = t"t;
              | with white noise f"tg and volatilities given by
              | t2 =
              | p
              | 0 + X
              | i=1
              | q
              | iXt2 i + X j t2 j :
              | j=1
              | There have been various modi cations on this approach, which led to more sophisticated but
              | on the other hand also more complicated models. For an overview see for example Bollerslev

              | et al. (1994) or Gouriéroux (1997). These models succeed in reproducing various stylized
              | facts. However, especially when dealing with long time series, they also have some draw-
              | backs, such as the occurence of the so-called IGARCH e ect in the popular GARCH(1;1)
              | model. (A critical discussion of this model can be found in St ric , 2003.) Mikosch and
              | St ric  (2003, 2004) argue that this e ect could be due to the fact that time series of log
              | returns are actually not stationary, which is one of the basic paradigms of the GARCH class
              | models. Furthermore, they show that also the so-called long range dependence e ects in the
              | second moment structure can be explained if the underlying time series is non-stationary.
              | The assumption of stationarity might also seem questionable especially for long nancial
              | time series, because the nancial markets and the general economic framework may change
              | over long Ftime periods. Consequently, the concept of stationarity might not be adequate
              | o
              | for a nancial time series model. A weakening of the strong requirement of stationarity
              | might be the concept of a locally stationary behaviour of the time series: this means that for
              | small time intervrals the time series is nearly stationary, whereas over longer time intervals
              | P
              | its (stochastic) behaviour changes gradually.
              | Drees and St ric  (2002) propose a very simple regression-based model that drops the
              | assumption of stationarity. eFor the returns Xt Drees and St ric  presume a multiplicative
              | e
              | structure, similar to that of (1.1). The di erence to the GARCH models lies in the mod-
              | elling approach for the volatilities t. In the GARCH class models these are determined by
              | endogenous factors, namely by parstvolatilities as well as past returns. In contrast to that,
              | R
              | Drees and St ric  assume the volatilities to be driven by some unknown (presumably rather
              | complex) market conditions, and hence to be determined exogenously. However, this exte-
              | rior mechanism might be too complex to deevelop a realistic stochastic model for it. For this
              | v
              | reason Drees and St ric  simply model the volatilities as a smooth, deterministic function
              | of time. Thus, their basic model is the following:
              | i
              | e=const:;
              | 8> Xt = + (t)"t; t = 1; 2; : : : ; n;
              | >
              | <> f"t : t = 1; : : : ; ng IID(0; 1); w
              | >: (t); t = 1; 2; : : : ; n; a smooth, deterministic function of time.
              | (1.2)
              | Considering the centered returns Rt = Xt , we have O
              | Rt2 = (t)2 + (t)2("t2 1):
              | n
              | Hence, (1.2) can be interpreted as a regression model for the squared volatilities, and non-
              | l
              | y
              | parametric regression techniques can be applied for estimating the volatilities. The innova-
              | tions "t are modelled by asymmetric Pearson Type VII distributions, which generalize the
              | class of t-distributions (see below), and thus allow for heavy tails. Drees and St ric  t this
              | model to the daily returns of the closing prices of the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500)
              | stock index from 2 January 1990 to 21 February 2002, depicted in Figure 1.1. They esti-
              | mate the volatilities by a simple Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator and they use a maximum
              | likelihood (ML) estimator to determine the parameters of the t-distributions. They show
              | that their model is competitive to the conventional GARCH(1;1) and EGARCH(1;1) models
              | concerning the tting of the data as well as the forecasting of future return distributions.
              | In this paper (which can be regarded as a continuation of the work of Drees and St ric ,
              | 2002) we take up and re ne the above regression model. However, instead of the assump-

              | The corresponding cdf is denoted G( ; u+; u ; v+; v ), or sometimes just G. The parameters
              | u+ and u essentially determine the shape of the density g: for u > 0 the term 1=2g( ; u; v)
              | equals the right tail of the density of a t-distribution with 2=u 1 degrees of freedom and
              | scale parameter v=(2 u)1=2 (which is sometimes also referred to as a Pearson Type VII
              | distributFion, cf. Johnson and Kotz, 1970, p. 114 .), and for u = 0 it equals the right tail of
              | the density of a normal distribution with mean zero and variance v2=2. The parameters v+
              | and v behave olike scale parameters for the positive and negative parts of the distribution,
              | respectively. It irseasily seen that G has nite variance i u+; u < 2=3. This modelling
              | approach is more exible than that of Drees and St ric  (2002), who always assume u+; u >
              | 0. In contrast, our mPodel can adapt to heavy-tailed as well as light-tailed innovations as
              | we shall see later on. e
              | Note that for each x we have g(x; u; v) ! g(x; 0; v) as u ! 0. Hence, g(x; 0; v) can
              | also be considered an approxiemation to g(x; u; v) for small values u. In the following this
              | property is often referred to as threnormal approximation of the tails.
              | Another nice property of the law G is that it allows for asymmetry in the tails, and thus is
              | quite exible. It may appear somewhat Rinconsequent to model the innovations (and thus the
              | e
              | centered returns) presumed to have mean zero by a class of distributions that in general
              | do not have this property (the distributions G are in general not centered, but only have
              | median zero). However, for practical applicativonsthis is not of great importance: indeed,
              | the model assessments in Section 4 will show that ithe means of the tted distributions are
              | approximately equal to zero. e
              | We further re ne the model of Drees and St ric  by dwropping their assumption of identi-
              | cally distributed innovations. Instead, we assume the parameters to be smooth, deterministic

              | Bandwidth selection. A crucial point in local likelihood estimatinonis the choice of an

              | a bandwidth that minimizes the asymptotic mean squared error of the estimates, which
              | is a function of h and also depends on some unknown constants. The latter ones have

              | (xi; yi). The resulting parameter estimates denoted ^[i](xi) are then plugged into the log-
              | likelihood function. Doing these computations for varying bandwidths h yields the cross-
              | validation function

              | which is then maximized with respect to h. This cross-validation approach is easy to im-
              | plement and we will also consider it later for our estimation problems in Sections 4 and
              | 5.
              | ApplyinFgthe asymptotics to our model. For applying the above asymptotics to our
              | modelling approach, we have to consider some minor modi cations to our model. After
              | centering the oreturns (cf. (2.1)), we are given observations f(t; Rt) : t = 1; : : : ; ng. For the
              | purpose of asymrptotic investigations, now we consider a rescaling of the time points by the
              | transformation
              | (3.4) Pes 7! ns 11 =: s~; 1 s n;
              | e
              | which maps the time points into the unit interval. These rescaled design points ful ll
              | the assumption on the points xi from the above paragraph on asymptotics with fX (x) =
              | [0;1](x). The parameter functiorncan be rescaled in the same way, setting ~(t~) := (t).
              | R
              | Note that this transformation is only necessary for the application of the asymptotic results
              | and the computation of the con dence intervals. It has no e ects on practical aspects of
              | the estimation. Therefore, when it is obvioeusthat an assertion is correct for the original
              | points of time (i.e. for t = 1; : : : ; n) as well as for the rescaled ones (i.e. for the points t~), for
              | v
              | ease of notation we often silently omit the notation for the rescaling. Especially, we do so
              | when considering the parameter function and the liocal polynomials.
              | e
              | In addition, we have to check whether the regularity conditions on the densities hold
              | for our model. Actually, this is the case for a suitable wsubmodel, namely for the family
              | fG : 2 g. Here the parameter space is de ned as := (u; u)2 ( ; )2, with arbitrary
              | values 0 < u < u < 2=3 and 0 < < < 1. The veri cation of Otheregularity conditions is
              | lengthy but quite standard. It is based upon showing diverse interchangeability conditions
              | for integration and di erentiation of the densities and rough estimatinoninequalities for the
              | derivatives of the (log-)densities; it also uses the fact that is compact. The complete
              | proof is given in Jönck (2005). Consequently, for estimations within thislsubmodel we can
              | y
              | calculate approximate con dence intervals for the true parameters according to Section 3.
              | Since 7! (Var G )1=2 is di erentiable in , an application of the Delta method yields
              | approximate con dence intervals for the volatilities, too.

              | v
              | odd-degree polynomial ts reduces boundary e ects. (For details see Aerts and Claeskens,
              | 1997.) Our choice of local linear ts takes account of both aspects and at the same time

              | e
              | In addition, we use the normal approximation from Section 2 in the following way: if for
              | some x the local likelihood estimation yields an estimate wu^+(x) = u, we can assume the true
              | value u+(x) to be very close to zero, thus implying a very light right tail of the corresponding
              | return distribution L (Rt). According to the above ideas, then Owe can approximate the
              | right tail of the return distribution by that of a N (0; +2 =2)-distribution, and thus u^+(x)
              | is assigned the value zero. Likewise we proceed if u^ (x) = u. In canseof either u^+(x) or
              | u^ (x) being zero, the conditions for the asymptotic results by Aerts and Claeskens (1997)
              | are violated. Therefore, in such cases we do not provide asymptotic con dleynceintervals for
              | any of the four paramters u+(x), u (x), +(x) and (x).
              | Numerical results. The estimates for the parameter functions are shown in Figure 4.1.
              | Apparently, the normal tail approximation is widely employed, and so it seems a valuable
              | tool to enhance the model's ability of assessing light-tailed distributions.
              | One can clearly see that for most points of time we have u^+ < u^ , i.e. the left tails of the

              | usually larger in absolute value than the extremely large positive returns. Furthermore, the

              | whenever the left tails of the distributions eget heavier, i.e. u^ increases, the parameter
              | v
              | function u^+ also tends to increase and vice versa. Apparently, such a symmetric behaviour
              | can be observed in the estimated scale parameters ^+ and ^ , too, where this symmetry
              | seems even much more distinctive. Remember thiat we de ned (t) = (t)v (t). Thus,
              | e
              | due to the symmetric behaviour of the scale parameters one might try to simplify the
              | model in such a way that only the volatility (t) is prewsumed a smooth function and the
              | parameters v+(t) and v (t) are presumed global constants. However, it turns out that the
              | O
              | quotient ^+(t)=^ (t) is strongly uctuating with varying t and that the con dence intervals
              | for +(t)= (t) (which can be derived easily from the use of the Delta method) are nearly
              | disjoint for many points of time. n
              | The estimates u^+ and u^ also seem to exhibit a certain kind of periodicity, which ex-
              | presses through the fact that the periods between two consecutive points lof ymaximum (and
              | minimum, respectively) are approximately of the same length. This e ect might be due to
              | the choice of the rather small bandwidth h for the estimation of the parameters at any point
              | of time less than 185 observations are taken into account. Indeed, for larger bandwidths this
              | periodicity appears much less distinct.
              | Figure 4.1 also shows the pointwise con dence intervals for the true parameters, as
              | derived in Section 3 (depicted in dotted lines). Since we can only provide such asymptotic
              | con dence intervals for those points of time for which no use of the normal approximation
              | is made for either tail (see above), we also compute 95%-bootstrap con dence intervals for
              | each of the estimated parameters (depicted in thin solid lines in Figure 4.1). To this end,

              | val for the parameter ^k(t). This is a very Rsimple procedure for the construction of bootstrap
              | con dence intervals. However, the resulting intervals should be interpreted carefully, because
              | we do not know anything about their (asymeptotic) properties and thus their accuracy. In
              | v
              | addition, we do not know the e ects on these intervals which occur due to the fact that for
              | parameter values u+ or u close to zero our model switches from t-distributions to normal
              | tails. Nevertheless, these bootstrap con dence inteirvals are helpful to get a rst impression
              | e
              | on how the local likelihood estimates in our modelling approach behave.
              | For u+ and u the asymptotic con dence intervals (as wwell as the bootstrap con dence
              | intervals) are rather wide, in some cases they cover nearly all of the space (u; u). This
              | is somewhat unsatisfying, because it yields little information Oabout the accuracy of our
              | estimated functions for the parameters u+ and u : these con dence intervals would as well
              | allow for parameter functions u+ and u of a di erent shape, for examnple they would allow
              | for globally constant parameter functions. It might therefore be worth thinking about a
              | simpli ed approach, modelling u+ and u as global constants, like Drees alnd ySt ric  (2002)
              | do. We shall come back to and further discuss this idea at the end of this section. For
              | the scale parameters + and the asymptotic con dence intervals as well as the bootstrap
              | con dence intervals are rather narrow. Indeed, they seem to coincide more ore less.
              | Figure 4.2 shows the estimated annualized volatilities ^a(t) := p250^(t), where the ^'s
              | are computed as the standard deviations of the estimated distributions. The corresponding
              | con dence intervals for the estimated volatilities result from the use of the Delta method.
              | The estimated annualized volatilities resemble very much the corresponding estimates from
              | Drees and St ric , concerning both, the oscillation behaviour and the magnitude of the
              | estimates, as can be seen from the right image in Figure 4.2. Only the double-peak in the
              | middle of 1995 appears a bit strange, in particular, since the time series is very calm during

              | they can be avoided by chosing a larger bandwidth, which on the other hand might lead to
              | an over-smoothing of some parts of the curve. To completely prevent such problems, the use
              | of a local, data-driven bandwidth (as proposed by Fan et al., 1998, Section 6) may be helpful,
              | which is however computationally very intensive and therefore not always recommended.
              | Assessment of the model. Summarizing so far, one can say that the local likelihood
              | estimators in our model, together with the normal tail approximation seem to yield rea-
              | sonable results for describing the development of the time series. Next we want to check
              | whether the model assumptions are really ful lled. Of course, this also gives some answer
              | to the qFuestion of the goodness of our modelling approach. We have to check whether
              |  the (ceontered) returns are independent,
              |  the estimatred distributions G^(t) are good approximations to the real distributions of
              | the returns, i.e. approximately we have Rt G^(t), and
              | P
              |  the estimated distributions G^(t) have approximately mean zero (i.e. the centered
              | returns Rt are really ecentered).
              | For this purpose we mainly uesethe same techniques as Drees and St ric  (2002). Further-
              | more, we check whether r
              |  the asymptotic con dence intervRalscover the true parameter with probability 0.95.
              | e
              | First we check whether the innovations or, equivalent, whether the centered returns
              | Rt are independent. This is one of the basic assumptions of our model. As the common
              | tests for independence always demand for a savmple of identically distributed observations,
              | we rst standardize the centered returns. Assumiing the estimated distributions are good
              | approximations for the return distributions, i.e. we ehave approximately Rt G^(t), the
              | variables w
              | (4.3) Vt := 1 G(Rt; ^(t)) ; t = 1; : : : ; n;
              | O
              | in the following referred to as standardized returns should be standard normal, and thus
              | in case of independence of the returns should be Gaussian white nonise.To check this, we
              | investigate the SACFs of the time series of standardized returns and of their absolute val-
              | ues; see Figure 4.3. For almost all lags both of the SACFs stay within thle y95%-con dence
              | intervals, given by the dashed lines, thus strongly supporting the independence assumption.
              | In addition, Figure 4.3 shows the p-values of the Portmanteau tests for the corresponding
              | time series for the rst 100 lags. While for the standardized returns the hypothesis of inde-
              | pendence is rejected for almost all lags at the 95%-level, the test supports the hypothesis of
              | uncorrelated absolute standardized returns for almost all lags. (For general information on
              | the con dence intervals or the Portmanteau test cf. Brockwell and Davis, 1987, Section 7.2
              | and p. 300 ., respectively.) This surprising e ect occurs in a similar form also in the original
              | model of Drees and St ric  (2002). To nd an explanation for this e ect, we consider the
              | SACFs of the returns and the absolute returns of the S&P 500, respectively, which are given
              | in Figure 4.4: the SACF of the absolute returns exhibits some long range dependencies (Fig-

              | within the second moment structure of the time series. They argue that the locally station-
              | ary modelling approach describes these non-svtationarities quite well. Consequently, the
              | absolute standardized returns behave nearly like uincorrelated random variables, as can be
              | seen by the evaluations of the corresponding SACF aendthe Portmanteau test (Figure 4.3,
              | bottom). However, this does not necessarily hold true for wthe standardized returns them-
              | selves. Actually, there also might be some non-stationarities (for instance in the mean of
              | the time series), which mainly manifest through the SACF of the returns, and which are
              | not taken into account by our modelling approach. Because the Ostandardization (4.3) itself
              | n
              | only changes the absolute values of the returns, but not their signs, the SACFs of both,
              | the returns (Figure 4.4, left) and the standardized returns (Figure 4.3, top left) do not dif-
              | fer very much, and thus our modelling approach cannot capture these e lects, which might
              | be a reason for the negative outcome of the corresponding Portmanteau tyest. Neglecting
              | this aw, we conclude that the standardized returns (and thus the returns) can at least
              | approximately be regarded as independent, in accordance to our model assumptions.

              | aproximately centered.
              | Our approach of evaluating the estimated model is not unproblematic, as it has two
              | major shortcomings: when testing for independence of the returns, we assume the estimated
              | distributions to be good approximations for the true return distributions. Whereas the
              | goodness of t tests used for checking normality of the standardized returns presume the
              | returns to be independent. We adopt this approach, because (to the best of our knowledge)
              | there is no reasonable method for testing independence and the goodness of t separately.
              | Consequently, the outcomes of the above evaluations should be interpreted carefully.
              | The second shortcoming of our approach concerns the p-values of the above goodness of
              | t tests. What we did above, was computing the estimates ^(t) on the basis of the centered
              | returns aFndthen applying the tests for normality on the standardized returns. These depend
              | on the estimates ^(t) and thus, again, on the centered returns (cf. (4.3)). So, actually, we use
              | o
              | the same data for estimating the model as we use for checking their goodness of t. Hence,
              | the accuracy of trhe p-values seems questionable. Due to the high dependency on only one
              | P
              | single set of data, they may not be very accurate and there might be some need for adjusting
              | them. Therefor let us remind how the p-values are calculated for the case of the KS, JB and
              | SW tests: each of these teestsis based on a test statistic, say T . It will reject the hypothesis
              | then de ned as p = P fT tg. eThus, we can redress the problem of an inaccurate p-value by
              | of standard normal Vt's if the realization of T , denoted t, takes large values. The p-value is
              | recalculating the law of T in considreration of the standardization (4.3). To this end, suppose
              | we are given J time series samples fRt j : t = 1; : : : ; ng, simulated according to (4.2). For
              | R
              | each of these simulated samples we compute the likelihood estimates f^ j(t) : t = 1; : : : ; ng
              | and the resulting standardized returns, given eby Vt j = 1 G(Rt j; ^ j (t)) . Consequently,
              | we have J + 1 realizations of T given by
              | v
              | t = T (V1; : : : ; Vn) and tj =iT (V1 j; : : : ; Vn j):
              | e
              | Then, from the empirical cdf FJ ( ) = J 1 PjJ=1 ftj g we get an approximation for
              | the law of T under the assumption that the distributions wofthe centered returns are really
              | given by the family fG^(t) : t = 1; : : : ; ng. Consequently, for the p-value we have as an
              | approximation the Monte Carlo p-value pMC = 1 FJ (t). For mOoregeneral information on
              | this Monte Carlo testing approach cf. Davison and Hinkley (2003), especially Chapter 4. (Of
              | course, for the same reasons that we already mentioned in the discussinonof the construction
              | of bootstrap con dence intervals, such a Monte Carlo p-value has to be considered carefully
              | rst of all it is a heuristic approach to assess the quality of the model t.l)y
              | We do this computationally intensive method for the KS, JB and SW tests with J = 1000
              | simulated times series. The results are given in the second line of Table 4.1. All three pMC-
              | values assert the good results from the simple tests, the Monte Carlo version of the JB
              | and SW tests, surprisingly, having even a higher p-value than their simple versions.
              | Finally we want to check whether the approximate con dence intervals actually cover
              | the true parameter with probability 0.95. Suppose that at time t neither u^+(t) nor u^ (t)
              | equals 0 or 2=3, such that we can construct con dence intervals for the true parameters,
              | according to Section 3. Again, we consider the simulated time series fRt j : t = 1; : : : ; ng
              | and the resulting local likelihood estimates f^ j(t) : t = 1; : : : ; ng, j = 1; : : : ; J . Assume

              | unexplainable doruble-peak of the volatilities (cf. Figure 4.1 and the comments thereon), and
              | thus should not be too surprising. Note that, although we have taken J = 1000, of course
              | the quantity Jt is less Pthan that for all t, due to the fact that also during the simulations
              | the normal approximation efor the tails is used. However, except for very few points of time,

              | The model with globally constant parameters u+ and u . In our rst discussion
              | R
              | of the estimates for the parameter functions u+ and u (see p. 10), we pointed out that an
              | alternative approach might be to model theesetwo parameters by global constants. We want
              | to brie y investigate how this simpli ed modelling approach behaves. To this end we take the
              | estimated scale parameters ^+ and ^ from the avbove local likelihood estimation and then we
              | rst re-estimate u+ and u as global constants, usiniga maximum likelihood (ML) estimator.
              | Based on these ML estimates, then the parameter funections + and are re-estimated with
              | local likelihood estimates, using again local linear ts. Cwonsidering the S&P 500 data this
              | yields globally constant parameter estimates u^g+lob = 0:209 and u^glob = 0:315, the newly
              | O
              | estimated parameter functions ^+ and ^ resemble very much the corresponding functions
              | from Figure 4.1, the plots are therefore omitted. The same model assessment procedures
              | n
              | that are used above can now be applied to the standardized returns resulting from these new
              | parameter estimates: the assessments of the SACFs and the Portmanteau tests look exactly
              | the same as those from Figures 4.3 and 4.5 (and are therefore omittedl),thus indicating
              | y
              | that the parameter estimates describe the data quite well. This is further supported by
              | the p-values and the Monte Carlo p-values based on J = 1000 simulated time series of
              | the goodness of t tests, which are given in Table 4.2. The p-values from the simpli ed
              | modelling approach even seem to slightly outperform the results from Table 4.1.
              | Of course, the above mixed modelling approach, where global constant ts for u+ and
              | u and local linear ts for + and are used, comes with the drawback that nearly two
              | times as many parameter estimates are needed in order to t the model. However, it has
              | the advantage that if once tted the model can be updated more easily, because only
              | the scale parameters + and have to be updated regularly, which thus also saves on
              | computing time. This is in particular interesting for real-time observation of a time series.

text          | Forecasting with local likelihood methods
              | We now want to provide an approach for forecasting future return distributions, the basic
              | idea of which is the same as in Drees and St ric  (2002). Subsequently, we provide numerical
              | results for one-day-ahead distributional forecasts, and discuss them.
              | Distributional forecasts in the regression model. Assume we are given the data
              | available up to time t which we interprete as the present and we try to forecast the
              | distribution of the next d-day return Xt;d = Pid=1 Xt+i. In our model this is given by
              | 8 d
              | >>< Xt;d = d + X Rt+s;
              | s=1

              | (5.1) F
              | o >:> Rt+s Rt+s independent, s = 1; : : : ; d.
              | Thus, we have tornd reasonable estimates for the future parameter values (t + s) that are
              | based only on the data available at time t. Presuming the forecasting horizon d is not too
              | large, an extrapolation Pof the Taylor polynomial in (3.1) using the notation from Section 3,
              | e
              | especially the vector notation from (3.2) yields

              | r
              | The unknown coe cients kj (t) can be estimated by local likelihood methods. Therefor we
              | employ a one-sided kernel, i.e. we use RK() f 0g instead of K( ). Again, the estimations
              | are based on the centered returns, which in the forecasting context are given by R~s = Xs Xt,
              | s t, where Xt = 1=t Pit=1 Xi. (Note that ethese centered returns have to be re-computed
              | for di erent values of t.) These two modi cativonsassure that the resulting local likelihood
              | estimates ^kj (t) only depend on the information available at time t. Plugging these initial

              | For each of the two tting schemes (a) and (b) we imiplement the cross-validation method (cf.
              | e
              | Section 3), computing the corresponding cross-validation functions for bandwidths ranging
              | from 0:040 to 0:200. In case of tting scheme (a) the resuwlting function is close to constant,
              | with a maximum at hCV 0:13, which is however not very distinct. For tting scheme
              | (b) the corresponding cross-validation function is strictly increasOingfor all considered band-
              | widths. On the basis of these results it seems hard to choose an appropriate bandwidth, in
              | both cases the cross-validation method yields large bandwidths. Indened,it is plausible that
              | for the prediction of future parameters a larger degree of smoothing is needed than for the
              | tting of the model. However, in case of tting scheme (b) this is somelwhat critical: the
              | y
              | bigger we choose h the more restrictive becomes the second constraint in (4.1), and thus the
              | smaller in absolute value the estimates ^k(1) for the rst derivatives of the parameter functions
              | have to be, which runs contrary to the idea of local linear ts for the parameter functions.
              | Therefore, in this situation it seems questionable if cross-validation is the best approach for
              | the choice of an appropriate bandwidth. Instead, we choose a smaller bandwidth for our
              | computations, taking h = 0:095, which is then rescaled for each t, as described above. This
              | bandwidth choice is essentially based on trial and error, doing parameter estimations with
              | di erent bandwidths.
              | We use the one-sided version of the Epanechnikov kernel. Otherwise, the same setting
              | i.e. same parameter space, optimization procedure, etc. as in the simple model tting
              | = p4 = 1.
              | However, they can easily be carried over to our forecasting context. To this end, for each
              | xed t we interpret t as the right boundary point of the interval [1; t] and we do the rescaling
              | proposed in (3.4) with n replaced by t. The bandwidth is rescaled in a similiar way, taking
              | ~h = h n=t for the estimation of (t), with h xed. The rescalation of the bandwidth ensures
              | that the number of observations used for the estimation does not change with varying t.
              | With this interpretation of t as right boundary point, it makes no di erence if we use the
              | above one-sided kernel or its two-sided version, because there are no observations at times
              | larger than t that could have in uence on the estimate. Consequently, the asymptotics,
              | which hold true for the right boundary point t when using a two-sided kernel, do so for
              | the use of the one-sided kernel as well. That is, the estimates ^(t) are consistent and
              | asymptoFtically normal, which enables us to provide approximate con dence intervals for the
              | o
              | true parameters (as proposed in Section 3). Again, it is favourable to use local polynomials
              | of the same degree for all parameters, i.e. p1 = = p4, in order to keep the expression
              | for the asymptotricbias to a minimum. For the tting of the model it was also preferable
              | P
              | to chose odd degree local polynomials to ensure that the expression for the bias is of the
              | same order for boundary points and inner points. Since in this situation we always consider
              | the estimation of the pareameter function in a boundary point, the question whether the
              | details). e
              | pi's should be even or odd is of minor importance (cf. Aerts and Claeskens, 1997 for more
              | We apply the above forecastinrgapproach to the S&P 500 daily returns, and we do one-
              | R
              | day-ahead distributional forecasts, i.e. we take d = 1. Two di erent computations are done,

              | that are used for the initial likelihood estimations (represented by one of the above cases
              | (a) and (b)), and with respect to the kind of extrapolation that is used for predicting future
              | distribution parameters (either (5.3) or (5.4)):
              | F1: The initial local likelihood estimates are computed with local constant ts for all
              | F
              | parameters. In this case (5.3) and (5.4) are the same.
              | o
              | F2: For the initial likelihood estimates local linear ts are used for all parameters, the
              | parameter forecasts are given by (5.3).
              | r
              | F3: Same as F2, but with parameter forecasts according to (5.4).
              | P
              | We now want to analyse the quality of the distributional forecasts provided by the random
              | variables X~t;1. Essentially, ethe analysis is based on the same ideas and testing devices that
              | we used for the assessments of the quality of the model tting in Section 4. Suppose for
              | e
              | a moment that the forecasting distributions L (X~t;1) perfectly match the laws of the true
              | future returns L (Xt;1), i.e. for trhecorresponding cdf's we have F~t;1(x) = Ft;1(x) for all
              | x 2 . Then the variables
              | R
              | (5.6) Zt;1 := 1 F~t;1(Xt;1) ; t = 301; : : : ; 3061;
              | e
              | in the following referred to as standardized vforecasts should be i.i.d. standard normal.
              | To check whether this holds true, we have to test for both, independence and normality of
              | the standardized forecasts. We do so for each of thieforecasting methods F1 F3.
              | e
              | In a rst step to check for the normality of the standardized forecasts, we apply the
              | goodness of t tests (KS, JB ans SW tests) to the time sewriesfZt;1 : t = 301; : : : ; 3061g. The
              | corresponding p-values for each of the three forecasting approaches are given in Table 5.1.
              | Considering only the p-values resulting from the simple versions Oof the three goodness of
              | t tests does not allow for an answer to the question whether the standardized forecasts
              | are (at least approximately) standard normal: as can be seen from tnhetable, the KS test
              | supports the hypothesis of normality of the standardized forecasts for all three forecasting
              | approaches, whereas the JB and SW tests nearly always reject the hypothlesyis.This con ict
              | might be a consequence of the standardization (5.6) and its e ects on the values of the
              | di erent test statistics (compare the discussion in Section 4), thus indicating the inadequacy
              | of these simple goodness of t tests. For this reason, again, we consider Monte Carlo
              | tests. The basic idea is the same as described in Section 4: we simulate J time series
              | fR~t j : t = 301; : : : ; 3062g, with independently simulated random variables R~t j G^t(t).
              | Based on these simulated time series we re-compute the initial local likelihood estimates
              | f ^ j(t) : t = 601; : : : ; 3062g, and we compute the corresponding forecasting parameters
              | ^t j (t + 1) and the simulated standardized forecasts fZt;j1 : t = 601; : : : ; 3061g. Repeating
              | these operations for j = 1; : : : ; J , and computing the KS, JB and SW test statistics for
              | these simulated standardized forecasts, nally yields approximate Monte Carlo p-values.

              | v
              | We do these Monte Carlo tests for each of the forecasting approaches F1 F3, where each
              | of the computed pMC-values is based on J = 1000isimulated time series. The results are
              | e
              | given in Table 5.1, too. Without exception, the tests strongly support the hypothesis of
              | normality of the standardized forecasts, and thus the idea wofa good forecasting. Apparently,
              | there are only small di erences in the pMC-values for Methods F2 and F3. Thus, for the
              | quality of one-day-ahead parameter forecasts it seems not of great Oimportance whether these
              | incorporate a trend component or not. This is due to the fact that in our special case the
              | values of the forecasting parameters ^k;t(t + 1) only vary at an order nofmagnitude of 10 3,
              | depending on whether they are computed according to (5.3) or (5.4). Consequently, for the
              | one-day-ahead distributional forecasts it has nearly no e ects which of tlhese two methods
              | y
              | is used for the computation of ^k;t(t + 1). For the same reason one can anticipate that the
              | forecasting results will not improve signi cantly by chosing higher order polynomial ts, and
              | therefore for one-day-ahead forecasts the use of local constant ts seems favourable since
              | it is computationally least intensive.
              | Next we consider the QQ-plots of the standardized forecasts. For the cases F1 and F3
              | these are depicted in Figure 5.2. (The QQ-plot for the standardized forecasts based on fore-
              | casting method F2 looks very similar to that of F3, so we omit it.) As can be seen from the
              | gure, the data roughly t the main diagonal, thus underpinning the normality hypothesis
              | for the standardized forecasts. Solely in the tails there seem to be some deviations, especially
              | when considering the standardized forecasts resulting from method F3 (Figure 5.2, right).

              | Altogether, taking into account both the QQ-plots and the results of the Monte Carlo
              | goodness of t tests, Pthedata seem not to directly contradict the hypothesis of normal-
              | ity of the standardized forecasts regardless of which forecasting approach F1, F2 or F3
              | e
              | is considered. Thus, at least approximately the standardized forecasts can be considered
              | normal. This supports the asseumption that the distributional one-day-ahead forecasts F~t;1
              | are reasonable approximations for rthe true distributions Ft;1.
              | It remains to investigate the dependence structure of the standardized forecasts. To
              | this end, we consider the SACFs of the Rtime series fZt;1g and fjZt;1jg. For the forecasting
              | e
              | approach F1 these are depicted examplarily in Figure 5.3. The corresponding SACFs for the
              | standardized forecasts based on the other forecasting approaches look very similar to the
              | ones showed in Figure 5.3 and thus are omittedv.Under the assumption of independence of
              | the standardized forecasts, the absolute values of bioth SACFs should be very small for all
              | lags. The SACF of the standardized forecasts fZt;1g eclearly exhibits such a behaviour and
              | thus might be evidence for the independence assumption wtobe true. However, the SACF
              | of the time series fjZt;1jg clearly seems to di er from that. For about the rst 30 lags the
              | SACF exceeds the upper 95%-con dence bound. In addition, the Portmanteau tests for
              | both, the standardized forecasts as well as for their absolute vaOlues, reject the hypothesis
              | of independence for almost all lags. The corresponding p-value plots look exactly the same
              | as the top right image in Figure 4.3, and thus are omitted. (The nstatements just made
              | also hold true for the other forecasting approaches F2 and F3.) Thus, thelhypothesis of the
              | standardized forecasts to be independent seems a bit questionable. y

              | above can also be used for larger forecasting horizons, say d = 20 or d = 40. Drees and
              | St ric  (2002) do such examinations. However, with a larger forecasting horizon there
              | occur several di culties: one major problem is that the distributions of the forecasting
              | variables X~t;d cannot be described in a closed form. Hence, simulations are needed to nd
              | good approximations for the convolution given in (5.5). Furthermore, the variables Xt;d

              | critical assumption, as we have seen in the above examinations the forecasting variables

              | needed for computing the distributions of the variables Xt;d. Hence, an assessment of the

              | Concluding remarks
              | o
              | Based on a work rof Drees and St ric  (2002), we considered a simple regression type model
              | for stock returns. The Pinnovations were modelled by four parameter asymmetric distribu-
              | tions, and the parameters were modelled as smooth, deterministic functions of time. In
              | addition, we considered aenappropriate normal approximation for the tails, enabling the
              | model to adapt to both, heaevy-tailed as well as light-tailed return distributions. By the
              | r
              | example of the S&P 500 daily returns, observed over a period of twelve years, the principle
              | of local likelihood estimation (in connection with local linear ts) prove to be a reasonable
              | method for tting our model to real-Rlifedata. In addition, approximate con dence inter-
              | vals for the true parameters could be given. The assessment of the model via the (Monte
              | Carlo) KS, JB and SW tests argued for a geood tting of our estimated model to the given
              | data. Solely the assumption of independence of vthe innovations seemed somewhat critical:
              | although the investigation of the SACFs of the (standardized) returns and their absolute val-
              | ues supported the hypothesis of independent innoviateions, the outcome of the Portmanteau
              | tests partly spoke against that. We also considered a simple device for forecasting future re-
              | w
              | turn distributions, and we did one-day-ahead distributional forecasts, using local likelihood
              | estimators with several forecasting approaches. Actually, an evaluation of these estimates
              | pointed out some minor aws, concerning the independence assOumption of the returns and
              | the results of the simple versions of the goodness of t tests. However, the results of the
              | Monte Carlo tests as well as the QQ-plots for the standardized forecnasts clearly argued for
              | our modelling approach to yield reasonable distributional forecasts.
              | l
              | Summarizing, one can say that our simple modelling approach, in connyection with the
              | local likelihood estimators, seems to succeed in describing nancial time series and giving
              | reasonable one-day-ahead forecasts. The results clearly underpin the adequacy of the idea
              | of a local modelling approach.
