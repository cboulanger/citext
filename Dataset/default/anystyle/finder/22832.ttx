              | In a series of three studies, we investigated the validity of implicit theories that the German
              | public holds regarding Muslims. German participants expected Muslims to be more aggressive
              | than Christians, and therefore be more supportive of terrorism than Christians. Furthermore,
              | Muslims were assumed to be more intrinsically religious and to hold a stronger identity with
              | their religion than Christians (Study 1). However, self-assessment surveys of Muslims and
              | Christians in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS: ex-Soviet Union) revealed that
              | Muslims were not more aggressive, more intrinsically religious, or more supportive of terrorism
              | than Christians. In contrast, Muslims reported a stronger religious identiﬁcation than Christians
              | (Study 2). Correspondingly, threat to religious identity was found to affect only Muslims’, but
              | not Christians’, attitudes toward terrorism conducted by outgroup perpetrators. In contrast to
              | Germans’ implicit theories regarding Muslims, it was the importance of religious identity and
              | not increased aggression potential that mediated this effect (Study 3).

              | and suicide bombings in Iraq and Israel) against
              | Western interests and rival Islamic groups
              | have dramatically changed the global political
              | climate and are likely to have heavily impacted
              | on the general perception that Westerners hold
              | regarding Muslims. As a consequence of these
              | frequent and recent terrorist attacks conducted
              | by Islamic fundamentalists, in addition to other
              | factors such as frequent media reports on ter-
              | rorist attacks or political justiﬁcations of West-
              | ern counterterrorist activity (e.g. ‘War on terror’
              | in Afghanistan and Iraq; ‘Operation Enduring
              | Freedom’), speciﬁc implicit theories and stereo-
              | types of ‘how Muslims really are’ relative to
              | Christians may have emerged within western
              | Christian societies. First of all, Muslims might
              | be expected to be more intrinsically religious
              | than Christians because many fundamentalists
              | have died (and are willing to sacriﬁce them-
              | selves) as suicide bombers in the name of their
              | religion. Second, religious identity might be
              | more important to Muslims than Christians,
              | because many Muslim nations do not distinguish
              | between church and state and thus try to prevent
              | secularization. Third, because of frequent suicide
              | bombings in Israel and Iraq, the broadcast exe-
              | cutions of Americans and hostages of other
              | nationalities in Iraq, and public proclamations by
              | Muslim terrorist leaders (e.g. Osama Bin Laden)
              | to ﬁght the enemies of ‘the true faith’, Christians
              | might expect Muslims to be extraordinarily
              | aggressive. Fourth, and ﬁnally, because most of
              | the recent spate of terrorist attacks were con-
              | ducted by Islamic extremists, and due to other
              | powerful media images such as those showing
              | Muslims celebrating the attacks on the World
              | Trade Center, Muslims might be expected to
              | be more supportive of terrorism as a justiﬁed
              | political instrument than Christians.1
              | Why is it important to know more about
              | Westerners’ implicit theories of Muslims?
              | Implicit theories are construction frameworks
              | that people use in everyday life to interpret and
              | evaluate their social world (Dweck, Chiu, &
              | Hong, 1995; Hong, Levy, & Chiu, 2001), guide
meta          | 374
text          | social judgments, and develop social actions
              | (Levy, 1999; Levy, Plaks, Hong, Chiu, & Dweck,
              | 2001). If members of Western Christian societies
              | really subscribe to the above-mentioned implicit
              | theories on Muslims, it could have far ranging
              | and serious consequences for the understanding
              | of and social interaction with the Islamic world.
              | An assumption by Christians that Muslims are
              | extraordinarily aggressive or inclined towards
              | terrorism could be expected to lead to a different
              | attitude toward Muslims than an assumption that
              | they are placid people who generally condemn
              | terrorism.
              | Because religiously motivated terrorism is
              | one of the biggest social challenges facing
              | modern Western societies at the present time,
              | in this study we primarily focused on expected
              | and actual attitudes of Muslims and Christians
              | toward terrorism, as well as the underlying psy-
              | chological mechanisms propelling these percep-
              | tions and attitudes. We report on three studies
              | that investigated: Germans’ implicit theories
              | on Muslims and Christians (Study 1); tested
              | their validity with self-assessment surveys of
              | Muslims and Christians in the Commonwealth
              | of Independent States (CIS: ex-Soviet Union)
              | (Study 2); and ﬁnally pointed out the speciﬁc
              | role of religious identity in attitudes toward ter-
              | rorism as a political instrument (Study 3).
              | Study 1
              | Germans in Munich, Bavaria—a predominantly
              | Catholic and arguably the most conservative
              | of German states—were asked about their
              | perceptions of Christians and Muslims living
              | in the CIS (which contains countries like
              | Azerbaijan, whose population is 95% Muslim
              | and which is located near Iran) in terms of
              | their religiousness, importance of religious
              | identity, aggression potential, and attitudes
              | toward terrorism. Compared to Christians, we
              | assumed that Germans expected Muslims to be:
              | (a) more intrinsically religious; (b) more strongly
              | religiously identiﬁed; (c) more aggressive; and
              | (d) more accepting of terrorism. We expected
              | these perceptions to be independent of whether
              | German participants were of a Christian de-
              | nomination or not. If our assumption was
              | correct, then the expected effects should not be
              | likely due to processes of social identity related
              | to religious afﬁliation (Tajfel, 1982). In other
              | words, expected effects should not be mainly
              | based on German Christians stereotyping of
              | Muslims because they consider the latter to be
              | a religious outgroup.
              | Method
              | Participants and design In total, 119 passers-by
              | at a pedestrian zone (67 females and 52 males,
              | ages ranging from 15 to 66 years; M = 32.49,
              | SD = 14.17) participated in Study 1, which was
              | based on a 2 (religion of target group: Christian
              | vs. Muslim) × 2 (denomination of participants:
              | Christian vs. no denomination) factorial between-
              | subject design.
              | Material and procedure Participants were re-
              | cruited at a pedestrian zone near the Ludwigs-
              | Maximilians-University Munich campus and
              | asked whether they would be willing to partici-
              | pate in a study dealing with attitudes towards
              | different religions. If they agreed, they were led
              | to an experimental lab at the nearby University
              | campus and read the following synopsis:
              | Religion is an important part of many societies and
              | many peoples’ daily life. Therefore, it is important to
              | learn as much as possible about religion in different
              | cultures. In the present study, we are interested in
              | your perception of Muslims (Christians) in the CIS
              | (ex-Soviet Union).
              | Subsequently, participants estimated Muslims’
              | (Christians’) aggression potential using a German
              | translation of an aggression questionnaire by
              | Buss and Perry (1992). This translation was
              | modiﬁed from a ﬁrst-person to a third-person
              | perspective (α = .93). Next (and in keeping
              | with single-item measurement of attitudes), par-
              | ticipants were asked on a scale from 0 (not at all )
              | to 10 (extremely) to what extent they supposed
              | that Muslims (Christians) condone terrorism as a
              | justiﬁed political instrument. Lastly, participants
              | reported to what extent they assumed that religious
              | identity is important to Muslims (Christians)
              | (0 = not at all important; 10 = extremely important).
              | The distinction between religiosity and religious
              | identity is useful, because religiosity concerns
              | Fischer et al. muslims and terrorism
              | the degree of a person’s religious participation
              | whereas, by contrast, religious identity concerns
              | the afﬁliation of a person with a certain religious
              | group (see Regnerus, 2003, who also measured
              | importance of religious identity using a single
              | item). Finally, participants were asked to assess
              | Muslims’ (Christians’) degree of intrinsic
              | religiosity (α = .61) in a German translation
              | (Zwingmann, Hellmeister, & Ochsmann, 1994) of
              | the religious orientation scale by Feagin (1964).
              | Because intrinsic religiosity is the measure for
              | ‘real’ and lived religiosity (Allport & Ross,
              | 1967; Bergin, 1991; Hill & Pargament, 2003),
              | we only used intrinsic religiosity as a measure of
              | religiosity (as opposed to extrinsic religiosity).
              | Finally, participants indicated in open-ended
              | question format their own religious denomination,
              | were informed about the actual aim of the
              | investigation, and were dismissed.

              | η2 = .07), to be more aggressive (F(1, 115) = 5.69,

              | that followed Baron and Kenny’s (1986) medi-
              | ation criteria was conducted in order to investi-
              | gate whether Muslims were expected to be
              | more accepting of terrorism because they were
              | assumed to be extraordinarily: (a) aggressive;
              | (b) intrinsically religious; or (c) strongly iden-
              | tiﬁed with their religion. Preliminary regression
              | analyses revealed that only the assumed aggres-

              | different expectations about Christians’ and
              | Muslims’ attitudes toward terrorism. First of
              | all, a regression analysis with the experimental

              | criterion ‘attitudes toward terrorism’ revealed
              | a signiﬁcant regression equation (R 2 = .49;
              | F(2, 116) = 54.55, p < .001). Both the expected
              | aggression potential (β = .58; t(117) = 8.16,
              | p < .001) and ‘religion of target group’ (β = –.24;
              | t(117) = –3.44, p < .01) reached a signiﬁcant
              | regression weight. A Sobel Test revealed that
              | the indirect effect of the independent variable
              | (religion of target group) on the dependent
              | variable (attitudes toward terrorism) via the
              | mediator (expected aggression potential) was
              | signiﬁcantly different from zero (Z = –3.44,
              | p < .001). Hence, the unmediated β-coefﬁcient
              | for religion of target group on attitudes toward
              | terrorism significantly decreased when the
              | expected aggression potential was controlled
              | for. Thus, the expected aggression potential
              | mediated the effect of religion of target group
              | on attitudes toward terrorism.
              | In sum, Study 1 conﬁrmed our expectations:
              | German participants assumed Muslims to be
              | more religious, more aggressive, more strongly
              | identiﬁed with their religion, and more accepting
              | of terrorism than Christians. Furthermore, a
              | mediational analysis revealed that participants
              | expected Muslims to be more accepting of ter-
              | rorism because they were expected to be more
              | aggressive than Christians. By contrast, intrinsic
              | religiosity and importance of religious identity
              | were not signiﬁcant mediators. In the next step,
              | we investigated whether Muslims are indeed
              | more intrinsically religious, more strongly
              | identiﬁed with their religion, more aggressive,
              | and more supportive of terrorism than Christians
              | by directly surveying Christians and Muslims via
              | self-assessment.
              | Study 2
              | Muslims and Christians from the CIS were asked
              | about their intrinsic religiosity, the importance
              | of their religious identity, aggression potential,
              | and their attitudes toward terrorism.
              | Method
              | Participants and design Participants were
              | recruited in two nations of the CIS (Ukraine
              | and Azerbaijan). Fifty-one (27 females and
              | 24 males, ages ranging from 17 to 84 years;
              | M = 42.43, SD = 15.12) Christians (N = 27; age:
              | M = 40.67, SD = 14.76) and Muslims (N = 24; age:
              | M = 44.00, SD = 15.80) participated in Study 2,
              | which was based on a 2 (religion: Christian vs.
              | Muslim) × 4 factorial multivariate design with
              | intrinsic religiosity, importance of religious iden-
              | tity, aggression, and attitudes toward terrorism
              | as dependent variables.
              | Material and procedure Participants read
              | instructions similar to those of Study 1. The
              | only difference was that the present study
              | focused on the participants’ own attitudes,
              | rather than on stereotypes and expectations
              | of Muslims and Christians. After having read
              | the introduction, participants indicated their
              | religious denomination. Subsequently, par-
              | ticipants answered a Russian translation of
              | the same questions and scales used in Study 1;
              | that is, a scale of intrinsic religiosity (α = .79;
              | Feagin, 1964), aggression potential (α = .83;
              | Buss & Perry, 1992), importance of religious
              | identity, and attitudes toward terrorism. Finally,
              | participants were informed about the aim of the
              | investigation, thanked for their participation,
              | and dismissed.
              | Results and discussion
              | A 2 × 4 MANOVA with religion of partici-
              | pants (Muslims vs. Christians) as a between-
              | participants factor, and intrinsic religiosity,
              | importance of religious identity, aggression,
              | and attitudes toward terrorism as dependent
              | variables, revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for
              | type of religion (multivariate F(4, 46) = 2.64,
              | p < .05, η2 = .19). All means and standard de-
              | viations are reported in Table 1. Univariate
              | follow-up analyses revealed that religious
              | identity was more important to Muslims than
              | Christians (F(1, 49) = 4.51, p < .05, η2 = .08).
              | In contrast, no differences between religious
              | groups were observed regarding intrinsic
              | religiosity (F(1, 49) = 0.04, p = .85, η2 = .00),
              | aggression potential (F(1, 49) = 0.12, p = .73,
              | Fischer et al. muslims and terrorism
              | η2 = .00), and attitudes toward terrorism
              | (F(1, 49) = 3.10, p = .09, η2 = .06).
              | Study 2 revealed that three of four implicit
              | theories that Germans hold regarding Muslims
              | (as compared to Christians) were without basis:
              | Muslims did not report that they were more in-
              | trinsically religious, more aggressive, or more
              | supportive of terrorism than Christians. How-
              | ever, Muslims reported that their religious
              | identity is more important to them than did
              | Christians. This result might have important
              | implications for Muslims’ and Christians’ atti-
              | tudes toward terrorism as a political instrument:
              | if a terrorist attack is conducted by a Christian
              | perpetrator, then Muslims might experience
              | strong religious identiﬁcation because they were
              | threatened by a perpetrator with a different
              | (Christian) religious afﬁliation. However, if a
              | terrorist attack is conducted by a Muslim per-
              | petrator, then Muslims’ religious identiﬁcation
              | might be less pronounced because the religious
              | afﬁliation of the perpetrator matches with their
              | own religious afﬁliation. In contrast, because
              | religious identiﬁcation is less important for
              | Christians than it is for Muslims, Christians’
              | religious identiﬁcation might be less affected
              | by the denomination or religious afﬁliation
              | of a terrorist. As a consequence, Muslims (be-
              | cause of the stronger religious identiﬁcation)
              | might regard terrorism as less justiﬁed if the
              | perpetrators were Christians compared to if they
              | were Muslims, whereas Christians’ perceptions
              | of a terrorist attack (because of the less pro-
              | nounced religious identiﬁcation) might be less
              | affected by the religion of the perpetrator. Study 3
              | was designed to test this line of thought.
              | Study 3
              | Muslims and Christians from the CIS read a
              | description of a religiously motivated terrorist
              | attack, which was either conducted by Muslim
              | or Christian aggressors (i.e. threat to religious
              | identity). Subsequently, participants indicated
              | to what extent they were (a) religious, (b) iden-
              | tiﬁed with their religion, (c) aggressive, and
              | (d) to what extent they perceived the terrorist
              | attack as justiﬁed. Because of the higher im-
              | portance of religious identity, Muslims were

              | expected to regard terrorism as less justiﬁed
              | if the perpetrators were Christians than if they
              | were Muslims. In contrast, Christians were not
              | expected to be sensitive to the religious source
              | of the attack. Furthermore, we expected this
              | interaction effect to be mediated by importance
              | of religious identity—and not by a greater
              | aggression potential of Muslims compared to
              | Christians—as was suggested by the results
              | from Study 1 on Westerner’s implicit theories
              | about Muslims.
              | Method
              | Participants and design Sixty (25 females and
              | 35 males, ages ranging from 18 to 67 years;
              | M = 39.03, SD = 12.22) Christians (N = 30;
              | age: M = 38.93, SD = 11.97) and Muslims
              | (N = 30; age: M = 39.13, SD = 12.67) from the CIS
              | participated in Study 3. The study was based on
              | a 2 (religion of participants: Christian vs. Muslim) × 2
              | (religion of terrorists: Muslim vs. Christian) factorial
              | between-subject design.
              | Material and procedure First of all, participants
              | received a description of a terrorist attack, which
              | was conducted either by Muslim or Christian
              | extremists. This description was formulated as
              | a ﬁctive newspaper article and contained the
              | following information to be imagined by the
              | participants:
              | Religiously motivated aggression and terrorism has
              | increased over the last few years, and has become
              | one of the most challenging social problems facing
              | the modern world. In the following study, we want
              | to investigate the effects of religiously motivated
              | aggression on individuals’ cognitions and emotions.
              | In order to prevent biasing your assessments, we
              | have not named the location or date of the following
              | description of a disastrous terrorist attack; needless
              | to say, it was a tragic example of Muslim (Christian)
              | aggression that was conducted in a major city in
              | the CIS some months ago by Muslim (Christian)
              | terrorists. Fourteen people lost their lives and
              | many others were seriously injured. People in that
              | city are still shocked and are desperately trying to
              | reclaim a sense of normality in their lives. A letter
              | from the terrorists revealed that Muslim (Christian)
              | extremists, who approved of using force to further
              | their religious agenda, were responsible for that
              | terrorist attack.
meta          | 378
text          | Next, participants ﬁlled out the same scales and
              | items as in the previous two studies: intrinsic reli-
              | giosity (α = .66), importance of religious identity,
              | aggression potential (α = .86), and attitude to
              | the terrorist attack. Finally, participants indicated
              | their religious denomination, were debriefed,
              | informed about the aim of the investigation, and
              | dismissed. Please note that all participants were
              | informed that the described terrorist attack was
              | only ﬁctitious and not real. It was also ensured
              | that no participant left the study with negative
              | emotions or mindsets.
              | Results and discussion
              | A 2 × 2 × 4 MANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant main
              | effect for the factor ‘religion of participants’

              | revealed that religious identity was more im-

              | Mediational analyses Preliminary analyses
              | revealed that only ‘importance of religious
              | identity’ could be a potential mediator of the
              | interaction effect of ‘religion of terrorists’
              | and ‘religion of participant’ on ‘justiﬁcation
              | of terrorism’. The aggression potential and
              | degree of intrinsic religiosity were not potential
              | mediators. Because the simple effects analysis
              | revealed that only Muslims’ attitudes toward
              | terrorism were affected by information about
              | the religious denomination of the terrorists,
              | the following analyses for religious identity as
              | a potential mediator were conducted only for
              | Muslims.
              | A regression analysis with the predictor
              | ‘religion of terrorists’ and the criteria ‘justiﬁca-
              | tion of terrorist attack’ revealed a signiﬁcant
              | We found that Germans in Munich, Bavaria, ex-
              | pected Muslims to be more intrinsically religious,
              | more aggressive, more strongly identiﬁed with
              | their religion, and more supportive of terrorism
              | than Christians, and that assumed/expected positive
              | attitudes toward terrorism were mediated by an
              | expected higher aggression potential of Muslims
              | (Study 1). However, direct surveys of Muslims
              | and Christians in the CIS showed that these
              | religious groups only differed with regard to the
              | importance of their religious identity: Muslims
              | reported a stronger identiﬁcation with their
              | religion than did Christians (Study 2). From this
              | result, we concluded that Muslims’ (relative to
              | Christians’) religious identity is more strongly
              | affected by the religion of a terrorist perpetrator,
              | which could possibly result in different attitudes
              | toward terrorism (Study 3). As expected, Muslims
              | assessed a terrorist attack to be less justiﬁed if
meta          | 379

              | it was conducted by Christian extremists than if it
              | was conducted by Muslim extremists. In contrast,
              | Christians’ acceptance of a terrorist attack did
              | not depend on whether the perpetrators were
              | Christian or Muslim. Furthermore, this differ-
              | ence between Muslims and Christians was
              | mediated by differences related to importance
              | of religious identity: when importance of
              | religious identity and the religion of perpetrators
              | (Muslim or Christian) were considered together,
              | only the importance of religious identity affected
              | Muslims’ attitudes toward terrorism. Note that
              | this result clearly contradicted the Germans’
              | implicit theory that Muslims favor terrorism
              | because they are extraordinarily aggressive.
              | Muslims’ attitudes towards terrorism did not
              | depend on an increased aggression potential,
              | but on their own religious identity. Please also
              | note that increased religious identiﬁcation of
              | Muslims did not lead to more justiﬁcation of
              | Muslim aggression, but to lowered justiﬁcation
              | of Christian aggression. This clearly contradicts
              | implicit theories Westerners hold about Muslims
              | (see Study 1).
              | Limitations
              | There were some limitations to our research that
              | must be borne in mind. First of all, our samples
              | were relatively small and thus not likely to be
              | representative of Christians and Muslims else-
              | where, nor of perceptions held by Christians and
              | nonreligious individuals elsewhere. Future re-
              | search should employ larger samples in order
              | to improve our ability to generalize our present
              | ﬁndings. Second, although recent research
              | revealed that Muslim youth in the USA are sig-
              | niﬁcantly more religious than comparable non-
              | Muslim youth in the USA (Ahmed, 2004), there
              | is doubt as to whether increased importance of
              | religious identity is unique to Islam: other research
              | has also shown that the centrality of religious
              | beliefs in one’s life is a component of intrinsic
              | religiosity and religious fundamentalism, and
              | neither of these two constructs are particularly
              | associated with a speciﬁc religious content or
              | different religious denomination. For example,
              | Hunsberger, Owusu, and Duck (1999) have
              | shown that the construct of religious fundamen-
              | talism operates similarly across religious and
meta          | 380
text          | cultural contexts. Speciﬁcally, for both Ghanaian
              | Muslims and Christians as well as for Canadian
              | Christians, religious fundamentalism was posit-
              | ively correlated with right-wing authoritarianism
              | and positively associated with negative attitudes
              | toward homosexuals (see also Hunsberger, 1996).
              | In addition, Burris and Jackson (2000) have
              | demonstrated that, for a sample of Christians,
              | intrinsic religious orientation was strongly
              | correlated with religious group identiﬁcation.
              | Intrinsically religious participants, whose
              | religious self-perceptions concerning religious
              | group membership were threatened, showed
              | increased religious self-stereotyping. For these
              | reasons, it is important to acknowledge that
              | the results of the present studies—that illustrate
              | stronger religious identiﬁcation among Muslim
              | than among Christian participants—may be
              | in part due to the context and/or small samples
              | from which the participants were recruited.
              | Hence, future research should further investigate
              | whether different religious afﬁliations are asso-
              | ciated with differences in religious identiﬁcation
              | by employing larger samples and different
              | cultures.
              | Third, Study 1 revealed that German partici-
              | pants perceived Muslims more negatively than
              | they did Christians. This might still be due to
              | evaluative ingroup/outgroup distinctions, be-
              | cause Muslims are considered an outgroup by
              | both German unafﬁliated persons and German
              | Christians. Given that unfavorable attitudes
              | toward religious outgroups are quite prevalent
              | (Jackson & Hunsberger, 1999), it seems possible
              | that social identity processes may still have been
              | relevant to both groups. Fourth and ﬁnally, with
              | regard to the ﬁndings of Study 3, that Muslims
              | viewed a terrorist attack as less justiﬁed if the
              | perpetrators were Christian rather than Muslim,
              | we want to note the potential relevance of his-
              | torical and current inequalities between some
              | countries that are predominantly Christian
              | versus Muslim in shaping Muslims’ perceptions
              | of the justiﬁability of terrorist attacks. Hence, it
              | would be a fruitful endeavor for future research
              | to control potential (perceived) historical differ-
              | ences between Muslim and Christian countries,
              | and their effect on perceived justiﬁability of
              | aggressive acts.
              | Theoretical and practical implications
              | Because implicit theories are used to interpret
              | and evaluate the social world (e.g. Hong et al.,
              | 2001), guide social judgments, and inform social
              | actions (e.g. Levy, 1999; Levy et al., 2001), these
              | results might have important implications for
              | understanding and social interaction between
              | the Islamic and Western Christian world: the
              | Western Christian world assumes Muslims to be
              | more aggressive than Christians, and therefore to
              | be more supportive of terrorism than Christians.
              | As a consequence, Muslims might be regarded
              | as potential aggressors threatening the Western
              | world, which would lead to oppressive actions
              | and preventive decisions such as military inter-
              | ventions (e.g. the war in Iraq, 2003, or the war in
              | Afghanistan, 2001), economic embargoes (e.g.
              | Iraq, 1991 to 2003) or interdictions of Islamic
              | symbols (e.g. the interdiction of head scarves
              | of Muslim women in German schools). Conse-
              | quently, Muslims interpret such actions by the
              | Western Christian sphere to be a threat to their
              | religious identity, which results in a different
              | attitude toward terrorism. This, in turn, conﬁrms
              | implicit opinions and stereotypes that Western
              | people hold regarding Muslims, and results in
              | further encroachments and restrictive actions
              | against Muslims and Islamic countries. This
              | line of thought illustrates how (unjustiﬁed) im-
              | plicit theories about Muslims could lead to a self-
              | fulﬁlling prophecy (e.g. Madon, Jussim & Eccles,
              | 1997; Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1968), maintaining
              | or even intensifying a vicious circle. In order to
              | break through this circle, the Western world
              | should avoid threatening Muslims’ religious
              | identity. For instance, it should be communicated
              | that military interventions to ﬁnd terrorists (e.g.
              | the Afghanistan war) are not meant to impair
              | Muslims’ religious or cultural identity. To con-
              | clude, the present results suggest that it is im-
              | portant for Western Christian society to critically
              | question its own stereotypic beliefs about Muslims
              | in order to promote a better understanding and
              | harmony between cultures.
              | Note
              | 1. Please note also that 15–20 years ago, Christians
              | in Ireland were using terrorism on a frequent
              | Fischer et al.
              | muslims and terrorism
              | basis as a political instrument. We investigated
              | only perceptions and stereotypes of religious
              | groups, and do not propose that attitudes toward
              | terrorism are indeed speciﬁc to a
              | certain religion or religious orientation.
