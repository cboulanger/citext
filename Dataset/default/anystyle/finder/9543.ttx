              | A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | Xavier Guillaume
              | Abstract: The aim of this essay is to discuss the places of the notions of subjectivity and reflexivity
              | within International Relations (IR) theory by contrasting the classical perspective inspired by
              | positivism with a dialogical perspective which tries to fully integrate these notions in its examination
              | of the specific nexus between identity and alterity. This dialogical perspective proposes a reflexive
              | tool, the hermeneutical locus, which is intended to provide a way to assess the subjectivity of the
              | cognised without falling into reification and a reflexive archaeology of the discipline of IR itself. In
              | this sense, a dialogical approach wishes to offer a reflexive tool for and on IR theory.

              | The general theme of this FQS special issue on reflexivity and subjectivity is of
              | great interest and significance in social sciences today and more particularly in
              | the field of International Relations (IR). IR is the field of study that attempts to
              | understand and/or explain interactions between state-based and/or non state-
              | based actors on a level that is not limited to the domestic realm and which is
              | often termed "international politics". In IR the traditional positivist perspective has
              | proved either to be a failure in its pretensions to provide the only theoretical and
              | scientific framework for social sciences or it has shown its limits as an epistemic
              | research programme (see LAKATOS 1970). In IR theory, the struggle during the
              | late eighties and early nineties against the dominant positivist research
              | programmes resulted in the emergence, among other currents, of a "middle
              | ground" meta-theory known as constructivism. This emergence lead to a
              | reflection in the discipline which specifically tackled not only the ontological, but
              | more specifically the epistemological and axiomatical dimensions of the different
              | IR research programmes (ADLER 1997; LAPID 1989). [1]
              | The main aim of this article is to provide a reflection on the meaning to give to
              | reflexivity and subjectivity when one discuss IR theory according to a specific
              | positive heuristic of the constructivist programme, that of dialogism (GUILLAUME

              | Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | 2002). Throughout the text, except when specified, I will adopt Mats ALVESSON
              | and Kaj SKÖLDBERG's (2000, p.5) definition of reflexivity as a conscious and
              | continuous attention to "the way different kinds of linguistic, social, political and
              | theoretical elements are woven together in the process of knowledge
              | development, during which empirical material is constructed, interpreted and
              | written". The interconnected notion of subjectivity designates, in turn, the quality
              | of either the cognised or the cognisant agents within the scientific framework in
              | each dimensions of their interrelations. A dialogical perspective, inspired by
              | Mikhail M. BAKHTIN's work, thus wishes to provide an epistemic framework to
              | the relations cognisant and cognised subjects entertain together in each level of
              | their interactions. [2]
              | Reflexivity and subjectivity are in effect fundamental problematics to those
              | wishing to design social sciences beyond the positivist standpoint as far as the
              | latter only recognised reflexivity in the sole consciousness of the cognisant to his
              | work. Furthermore, the positivist standpoint categorically refused to fully consider
              | the problem of subjectivity, especially that of the cognised. The real challenge,
              | however, resides in the articulation of a coherent relation between the two
              | elements within a research programme, trying thus to integrate them in a scien-
              | tific framework (i.e. a project aimed at constituting and constructing knowledge)
              | without falling into the recurrent problems of a "relational theory of reference",
              | such as postmodernism, which, in the words of Alexander WENDT (1999,
              | pp.56-57, original emphasis),
              | "cannot account for the resistance of the world to certain representations, and thus
              | for representational failure or misinterpretations. [...] The external world to which we
              | ostensibly lack access, in other words, often frustrates or penalizes representations.
              | Postmodernism gives us no insight into why this is so, and indeed, rejects the
              | question altogether." [3]
              | Dialogism represents an answer to WENDT's challenge for "a theory that takes
              | account of the contribution of mind and language yet is anchored to external
              | reality", as it proposes a form of relational perspective which soundly integrates
              | this "external reality". This type of perspective, as underlined by Mustafa
              | EMIRBAYER (1997, pp.287-288, my emphasis), effectively
              | "derive[s] the meaning, significance, and identity [of the cognised] from the
              | (changing) functional roles they play within that transaction [i.e. relationality]. The
              | latter, seen as a dynamic, unfolding process [e.g. a dialogue], becomes the primary
              | unit of analysis rather than the constituent elements themselves." [4]
              | These dimensions are furthermore "inseparable from the [relational] contexts
              | within which they are embedded", or, in other words, in the external reality
              | missing in WENDT's account of relational perspectives. By anchoring an
              | understanding of international relations through a relational perspective of the
              | cognised, dialogism provides a way to articulate the notions of reflexivity and
              | subjectivity that are necessarily linked to a sound consideration of the cognised
              | self-understanding/perception and its relationality to other cognised (see

              | Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | BRUBAKER & COOPER 2000). Moreover, reflexivity and subjectivity are an
              | actual problematic as they are related to both cognised and cognisant agents
              | (whether individually or collectively) in the three different levels constituting the
              | scientific framework. This essay therefore wishes to address these three following
              | levels: (i) the level of the cognised "objects" (we will see that this term itself is
              | questionable) in their subjective interrelations as agents within political, social,
              | economical, and historical structures; (ii) the level of the scientific research itself,
              | the reflexive and subjective relations the cognisant "subject" entertains with the
              | cognised "object"; (iii) the level of the reflexive and intersubjective interactions
              | between cognisant "subjects". Dialogism, as we will see, precisely offers a model
              | to understand or, at least, problematise each levels either within their own
              | dimensions or in their interrelating ones. [5]
              | In order to bring about this threefold connection, I will first discuss the traditional
              | positivist frame adopted by most IR scholars and situate the notions of reflexivity
              | and subjectivity in relation to it. This will lead me to tackle the first level mentioned
              | above and call attention to the subjective quality of the cognised, especially when
              | the latter is problematised as an identity. I will then introduce the foundation of a
              | dialogical approach in IR which specifically attempts to integrate the notion of
              | identity as a specific factor in international relations while embodying the notions
              | of reflexivity and subjectivity at the core of its epistemological concerns notably by
              | underlining the transgredient character between identity and alterity. In the
              | second section, I will introduce the two other levels of the scientific inquiry by
              | stressing the need to develop a processual/relational approach of IR theory in
              | order to avoid as much as possible the risk of reification existing in the passage
              | from the first to the second level and to conduct a reflexive assessment of one's
              | own discipline, such as IR theory, by considering it as a site of cultural practice.
              | Dialogism is thus presented as a reflexive tool for and on IR theory, through the
              | hermeneutical locus it creates, with all its epistemological consequences either in
              | the relations the cognisant entertains toward the cognised or the cognisant
              | toward other cognisant. [6]
              | 2. International Relations Theory, the Question of the Identity-Alterity
              | Nexus, and the Dialogical Approach of International Relations
              | Traditionally, IR theory only focalised on the two main factors (interest and power)
              | that were deemed to causally explain what was considered to be at the core of
              | the discipline: war and peace. Up to the end of the 1980s, the main trend within
              | IR theory was to address these factors within a positivist frame regarding natural
              | sciences as the way to follow if one wanted to do "real" science. Contrary to most
              | social sciences, IR only lately fully integrated another possible "explanatory"
              | factor—identity—to its general theoretical framework, finally avoiding it and
              | dismissing it as secondary as it used to within traditional perspectives. This
              | emergence, as illustrated in several contributions (see for instance LAPID &
              | KRATOCHWIL 1996; KATZENSTEIN 1996), partly enabled IR scholars to rethink
              | the epistemological and methodological dimensions of their field by stressing out
              | more saliently the question of identity, without actually threatening the more
              | traditional approaches, thus reconsidering a usually unproblematised element of

              | Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | IR theory: the ways to assess the object of study. This section will first present
              | the traditional developments in IR concerning the notions of subjectivity and
              | reflexivity and then introduce dialogism as an alternative perspective for IR to
              | approach both these notions in function of a specific factor, identity, and the three
              | dimensions characterising the scientific inquiry. [7]
              | As mentioned, IR theory for long has been based upon a perspective that only
              | interest and power were at the heart of any explanation, or even understanding,
              | of the international world. This foundation is the result of a disciplinary "debate" in
              | IR between the so-called "idealists" and the emerging "realists" during the
              | interwar period. As the (realist) naming suggests (see CARR 1939), the formers
              | were deemed to provide a normative, utopian, ought-to-be perspective on world
              | politics, based on the ground that ideas/norms were at the heart of international
              | relations (e.g. WILSON's fourteen points1). The latter, however, were depicted, in
              | a debate that was mainly constructed by them (see THIES 2002), as providing a
              | "realist" and "objective" perspective on world politics, taken the international world
              | as it is in its anarchic and conflictual dimensions and not as the "idealists" wished
              | it could be, a non "zero-sum" game in which conflicting national interests can be
              | resolve through the rule of law (see BROWN 2001, pp.21-30). In his definition of
              | political realism, Hans J. MORGENTHAU (1967, p.4, my emphasis), the founding
              | father of post-war realism, synthesised what was at stake in the development of
              | the discipline at that time and the subsequent basic epistemological driving lines
              | which were to be adopted by most IR scholars since then, whether "realist" or not.
              | "Political realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by
              | objective laws that have their roots in human nature. In order to improve society it is
              | first necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. The operation of these
              | laws being impervious to our preferences, men will challenge them only at the risk of
              | failure. Realism [...] must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theory
              | that reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It believes
              | also, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and opinion—
              | between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence and illuminated
              | by reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from the facts as they
              | are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking." [8]
              | According to MORGENTHAU, then, all IR scholar should follow a positivist-
              | empiricist perspective according to which the objects cognised are metaphysically
              | detached from their linguistic and theoretical assessment by the cognisant. What
              | matters for such a perspective is the correspondence between the signifiers used
              | by the cognisant and the referents, objectively rendered by the signifiers, deemed
              | to be existing independently from the formers. Observation, experimentation,
              | falsidical testing and the judgement of history are among the many ways by which
              | theories can be measured as correspondent to the truth of external reality. This
              | monistic metaphysic implies that as there is one world "out there", there can only
              | be one true (scientific) perspective corresponding to this sole reality (see
              | 1 President Woodrow WILSON's fourteen points justified ideologically the US entry in WWI. It is a
              | classical illustration of an ought-to-be perspective in IR.

              | SPEGELE 1996, pp.48-49). The notion of interest provides, in turn, the con-
              | ceptual link between both worlds. To refer to MORGENTHAU (1967, p.5) again,
              | "The main signpost that helps political realism to find its way through the landscape of
              | international politics is the concept of interest defined in terms of power. This concept
              | provides the link between reason trying to understand international politics and the
              | facts to be understood. [...] We assume that statesmen think and act in terms of
              | interests defined as power, and the evidence of history bears that assumption out.
              | [...] Thinking in terms of interest defined as power, we think as [the statesman] does,
              | and as disinterested observers we understand his thoughts and actions perhaps
              | better that he [...] does himself. The concept of interest defined as power imposes
              | intellectual discipline upon the observer, infuses rational order into the subject matter
              | of politics, and this makes the theoretical understanding of politics possible." [9]
              | From its realist birth then, the discipline of IR has been trying to reach a
              | "scientific", and thus honourable, status within social sciences, a drive that was
              | mainly and until quite recently embodied in the attempt to do and be as "real
              | science" does and is. By "real science" it was usually and effortlessly meant
              | natural sciences and their positivist/rationalist approach in addition to a tendency
              | to only adopt quantitative and/or formal methods. Far from rejecting a priori any
              | "positivist" approach in IR, I support that IR theory should not bluntly strive to
              | attain a "positivist" and thus "scientific" status by focalising on what might well be
              | an aporia for many aspects of international relations. Social sciences cannot
              | become like the natural sciences even though they might well be inspired
              | methodologically by them. "Positivist" approaches to international relations have
              | in effect proved to be feasible, necessary and, often, relevant. Recent analysis of
              | fundamental topics such as war or national identity, however, showed that there
              | is a demand for different and/or complementary approaches as Erik RINGMAR
              | (1996) and Rodney B. HALL (1999) underlined in their recent books which
              | focused on this other fundamental factor of international relations: identity. If the
              | positivist quest thus was highly understandable, it missed, however, one simple,
              | yet major, flaw in such a drive: natural sciences do not deal with self-conscious
              | and reflexive subjects.2 [10]
              | We can now sort out what are the traditional places held by the notions of
              | subjectivity and reflexivity within IR following MORGENTHAU's statements,
              | perfectly reflecting the three tenets of positivism which remains the main
              | conscious or unconscious epistemic framework used by IR scholars (see
              | NEUFELD 1995, pp.22-38). The first tenet is that of "truth as correspondence"
              | which affirms the validity of positive knowledge by its objective correspondence to
              | the external and observable world. What is at stake here is the assumed
              | separation between the cognised (the object, the external reality) and the
              | cognisant (the subject). The notion of objectivity, following MORGENTHAU and
              | most of the "positivist" literature in IR, refers here to one of its possible
              | definitions: the "quality of what exist independently of any knowledge or idea"
              | 2 It might be arguable, however, that small parts of the natural sciences (in its most
              | encompassing acceptation) deal with self-conscious and reflexive subjects (such as the
              | primatologists with the pigmy chimps Bonobo for instance).

              | Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | (NADEAU 1999, p.451). The second tenet is also linked to the idea of objectivity
              | but in its definition as "the quality of one who sees things the way they are without
              | being influenced by its preferences or habits" (NADEAU 1999, p.451). In the idea
              | of the value-free nature of scientific knowledge resides the objective quality of the
              | cognisant in its capability to discipline, to discern and to separate what the facts
              | are from the values, and the realm of the object from its subjective world. These
              | characterisations of the notion of objectivity are, in turn, to be linked to the third
              | tenet of positivism, the idea of the methodological unity of science which consider
              | that the approaches developed to make sense of the natural world are
              | appropriate to address the social world as its fundamental nature, a realm of
              | object, is not essentially different from the former. In sum, within a positivist
              | scenario, the two definitions of objectivity are encompassing the notions of
              | subjectivity and reflexivity. Subjectivity, for instance, is understood as defining the
              | natural relation the cognisant entertains with the cognised, the aim of the former
              | being to transcend his subjectivity to reach an objective mode of relation to the
              | latter. As the cognised is an object, the only subject of science, the cognisant,
              | has to be objective. In this sense, the cognisant has to be reflexive to the
              | cognised to the extent the cognisant has to discipline his relation to the latter in
              | order for it to reach an objective, value-free, status. Subjectivity and reflexivity are
              | thus subsumed into the two definitions of objectivity as mentioned before. [11]
              | This positivist understanding of the concepts of subjectivity and reflexivity is
              | highly embedded in the epistemological developments within natural sciences
              | and unfortunately is rather poor for the social sciences if bluntly translated. In
              | effect, social sciences, as part of the humanities, study human consciousness as
              | a subject (whether individually or collectively) of a material world within which it
              | constructs a social, intersubjective world (GUZZINI 2000, p.164) by the
              | interweaving of what BAKHTIN (1986b) would call texts, that is all the activities by
              | which human beings are "readable". A text, in the BAKHTINian sense,
              | encompasses both narrative and behavioural "documents", which should not be
              | understood as an exclusive choice, in the humanities, to the sole discourse
              | analysis or hermeneutical perspectives. The aim of social sciences is to read the
              | different texts of human activities, that the cognised produces whether
              | consciously or not, through different lenses (the diverse sub-fields of social
              | sciences) and a diversity of approaches (positivist, structuralist, systemist,
              | dialogical, etc.). To reframe this argument in BAKHTIN's words (1986c, p.161),
              | natural sciences are monological while social sciences are dialogical in regards to
              | their "object" of studies. Natural sciences necessarily and naturally possess what
              | BAKHTIN calls an "epistemological consciousness" which is "a unitary and
              | unique consciousness".
              | "Everything this consciousness deals with must be determined by itself alone: any
              | determinateness must be derived from itself and any determination of an object must
              | be performed by itself. In this sense, epistemological consciousness cannot have
              | another consciousness outside itself, cannot enter into relation with another
              | consciousness, one that is autonomous and distinct from it. Any unity is its own unity;
              | it cannot admit next to itself any other unity that would be different from it and
              | independent of it (the unity of nature, the unity of another consciousness), that is, any

              | sovereign unity that would stand over against it with its own fate, one not determined
              | by epistemological consciousness. This unitary consciousness creates and forms any
              | matter it deals with solely as an object and not as a subiectum, and even a subiectum
              | is no more than an object for it. The subiectum is known and understood only as an
              | object, for only valuation could render him a subiectum—the bearer of his own
              | autonomous life, experiencing his own fate" (BAKHTIN 1990, pp.88-89). [12]
              | The humanities on the contrary have to take into account the subiectum because
              | they possess the "specific task of establishing, transmitting and interpreting the
              | words of others" (BAKHTIN 1981, p.351). Natural sciences are the only subject,
              | the only intellect, at work cognising and speaking about an object which is
              | necessarily voiceless. To give a voice to the cognised, it is then important in
              | social sciences to consider the cognised as a subject and to try to adapt our
              | epistemology to this fundamental consideration. In review then, social sciences
              | are oriented towards the reflexive interconnection of at least two subjects, that of
              | the cognisant and that of the cognised. The fact that the cognised is regarded as
              | an "object" in the positivist sense is as much an epistemic choice as it is to regard
              | the cognised as a "subject" in the dialogical sense. However, the dialogical
              | perspective tries to problematise the inherent subjective quality of the cognised.
              | To quote BAKHTIN (1986d, p.144) again
              | "Sciences of the spirit [i.e. the humanities]; their field of inquiry is not one but two
              | 'spirits' (the studied and the person who studies, which must not be merged into one
              | spirit). The real object of study is the interrelation and interaction of 'spirits'." [13]
              | In order to address these different elements by focalising on the question of
              | identity and identity formation, I will hereby elaborate a dialogical perspective,
              | grounded on Mikhail Mikhailovitch BAKHTIN's works. The widespread interest in
              | BAKHTIN thinking has been a major source of renewal in several disciplines such
              | as in literary studies, linguistics or the humanities in general3. It has, however,
              | never been seriously taken into consideration within the field of IR except for
              | some authors which used him in a very impressionistic way (see ASHLEY 1989,
              | pp.263 and 281; SHAPIRO 1989, p.81). One has to refer to an article by Iver B.
              | NEUMANN (1996, pp.148-149 and 154-155) to see an outline of the possible
              | uses of BAKHTIN within IR theory and its potential relevance to the identity-
              | alterity nexus. By focalising on identity and identity formation in international
              | relations, the traditional nexus represented by war and peace (conflict and co-
              | operation), underpinning most IR works so far, would not be alone anymore to
              | serve as an underlying characterisation of the interplay between states or other
              | agents in the international system. The identity-alterity nexus is in effect a
              | contending, yet not necessarily competing, characterisation at the heart of the
              | epistemological and methodological renewal witnessed during the past decade.
              | This renewal fundamentally concentrated on the questioning of the definition and
              | use of omnipresent concepts such as anarchy (i.e. the absence of a hierarchy
              | and an order among the main agents of international relations) in the overall
              | 3 See for instance the different interdisciplinary books edited in the past five years by Amy
              | MANDELKER (1995), Michael BELL and Michael GARDINER (1998) and Peter HITCHCOCK
              | (1998).

              | understanding and explanation of international relations. As WENDT (1992)
              | showed, anarchy had been reified by traditional approaches and thus became a
              | substantive concept which was used to deterministically construct its objects of
              | study. Anarchy became the structural lenses through which the object of study—
              | most generally the state—was constructed. The problem with "positivist"
              | perspectives in IR was then not so much about the idea that social facts, the
              | object of study and, for some, reality as such were constructed but rather the
              | question of "how" it was done and which consequences it has reflectively on IR
              | theory. This is precisely the kind of questions a dialogical understanding of
              | international relations tries to answer to. However, by using "identity" as a
              | different pattern of understanding we should not fall into the same conceptual
              | trap. Constructivism, as a research programme, has to avoid following the new
              | "logic of identity", as traditional approaches followed the "logic of anarchy", in
              | order to construct a valid and coherent epistemic body (WEBER 2001, p.78). [14]
              | In using the category "identity" we should therefore be aware of and emphasise
              | the inherent difficulties and ambiguities related to it, as "identity" is both a
              | category of political and social practices and a category of political and social
              | analysis (see BRUBAKER & COOPER 2000). An "identity" might then be a
              | category of practice of a cognised subject who might be taken as an "object"
              | through the lenses of "identity" as a category of analysis. We are thus precisely in
              | the moment where the traditionally defined subjectivity and objectivity are
              | collapsing together, since what is felt as an "identity" by a subject can be
              | interpreted only through its objectivation—its constitution as a category of
              | analysis. As mentioned, the danger of such a necessary objectivational
              | movement lies in its reification, which according to our dialogical framework can
              | be understood in two complementary ways. First, and in a more classical
              | understanding, if "identity" is not a necessary category of analysis to make sense
              | of phenomenon related to "identity" as a category of practice, it should not be
              | used "...in an implicitly or explicitly reifying manner, in a manner that implies or
              | asserts that ... 'identities' exists and that people 'have' ... an 'identity'". This type
              | of reification is however common, as exemplified by the neorealist use of
              | "anarchy", and therefore scholars,
              | "[...] should seek to account for this process of reification. We should seek to explain
              | the processes and mechanisms through which what has been called the 'political
              | fiction' of the 'nation' [or 'identity'] can crystallize, at certain moments, as a powerful,
              | compelling reality. But we should avoid unintentionally reproducing or reinforcing such
              | reification by uncritically adopting categories of practice as categories of analysis"
              | (BRUBAKER & COOPER 2000, pp.5-6; see also MELUCCI 1995, pp.42, 50-51). [15]
              | Second, following a dialogical understanding and in an attempt to address
              | BRUBAKER and COOPER's stance, reification also means to treat the cognised
              | as a voiceless "object". It is to say, as we will see, that "identity", as a category of
              | analysis, should not become a monological construction of categories of
              | practices. The cognised is or has been a subject and "identity" as a fictional
              | (narrative), subjective (individual) and intersubjective (collective) phenomenon
              | cannot therefore be studied as a voiceless "object" since it will characterise it as a

              | thing and not as a reflexive self-representation. A dialogical understanding of
              | "identity", and therefore any objectivational movement adopting such a
              | perspective, partially lift up this problem by approaching an "identity" through the
              | conscious mediation of a hermeneutical locus from which an "identity" is set in a
              | dialogical network relative to other "identities" (alterity) defined as relevant by
              | their place in this network (determined by their expression, contextuality and rela-
              | tionality in/to this "identity"). Dialogism then is a sound way to propose an
              | analysis of "identity" without falling into the reification of the concept, as it was the
              | case with "anarchy". It is furthermore a sound assessment of the epistemic
              | relation the cognisant has with the cognised. In effect, the process of
              | objectivation should not become the effacing of the subjective quality of this
              | "object". The cognisant should enter in a dialogue with the cognised. This
              | dialogue, however, shall never be "full" as there will always be a discrepancy in
              | the communication between the two elements. It precisely is in this dissymmetric,
              | but not necessarily unequal, relation that lies the possibility of knowledge as the
              | cognisant situates him/herself outside the cognised, establishing a dissymmetric
              | dialogue by framing this interrelation through a problématique (in the French
              | acception) (AMORIM 1996, pp.22-23, 31, 59). [16]
              | So let's turn now to the key notion of dialogism to see how it can allow us to
              | tackle in a positive and heuristic perspective the problematic relations the notion
              | of "identity" raises in IR theory. In effect, dialogism can constitute a model which
              | can epistemologically address the need of an adequate framework in relation to
              | the nexus between "identity" and "alterity" while integrating in this framework the
              | notions of subjectivity and reflexivity.4 Dialogism is a concept which mainly has to
              | do with discursive elements and relates more specifically to utterances. BAKHTIN
              | (1986a, p.92, my emphasis) states that:
              | "The expression of an utterance can never be fully understood or explained if its
              | thematic content is all that is taken into account. The expression of an utterance
              | always responds to a greater or lesser degree, that is, it expresses the speaker's
              | attitude toward others' utterances and not just his attitude toward the object of his
              | utterance. [...] However monological the utterance may be [...], however much it may
              | concentrate on its own object, it cannot but be, in some measure, a response to what
              | has already been said about the given topic, on the given issue, even though this
              | responsiveness may not have assumed a clear-cut external expression. [...] The
              | utterance is filled with dialogic overtones, and they must be taken into account in
              | order to understand fully the style of the utterance. After all, our thought itself [...] is
              | born and shaped in the process of interaction and struggle with others' thought, and
              | this cannot but be reflected in the forms that verbally express our thought as well. [...]
              | The interrelations between inserted others' speech and the rest of the speech (one's
              | own) [...] are analogous (but, of course, not identical) to relations among rejoinders in
              | dialogue". [17]
              | An utterance is thus a moment within a semantic network which is composed by
              | the sum of all the existing utterances to which the utterance examined is
              | 4 The following paragraphs are a synthesis of the dialogical approach I presented in Xavier
              | GUILLAUME (2002).

              | somehow "responding to". This interweaving of utterances is not necessarily an
              | interrelation between actual and active utterances, as it can in fact exist between
              | actual and active utterances and absent and passive ones (TODOROV 1981,
              | p.97). All in all, an utterance is functionally defined by at least one or many
              | utterances which belong to a set of utterances either contemporary and/or pre-
              | existing, active and/or passive. There is another essential quality of the utterance:
              | "[I]ts quality of being directed to someone, its addressivity. [...] This addressee can be
              | an immediate participant-interlocutor in an everyday dialogue, [...] a more or less
              | differentiated public, ethnic group, contemporaries, like-minded people, opponents
              | and enemies. [...] And it can also be an indefinite, unconcretized other [...]. Both the
              | composition and, particularly, the style of the utterance depend on those to whom the
              | utterance is addressed, how the speaker (or writer) senses and imagines his
              | addressees, and the force of their effect on the utterance" (BAKHTIN 1986a, p.95,
              | emphasis are mine). [18]
              | Addressivity is therefore another central characteristic of any utterance since it
              | provides an anchorage between dialogism and a theory of "identity". There are
              | two mains reasons for such an affirmation. On the one hand, it is necessary to
              | understand an utterance as an all-embracing category which is not limited only to
              | purely discursive practices. Any utterance is indeed a conception of the world, a
              | Weltanschauung (TODOROV 1981, p.97). As noted by BAKHTIN in his 1926
              | "Discourse in Life and Discourse in Art" (BAKHTIN 1994, pp.163-164),
              | "the extraverbal situation is far from being merely the external cause of an utterance
              | —it does not operate on the utterance from outside, as if it were a mechanical force.
              | Rather, the situation enters into the utterance as an essential constitutive part of [its
              | semantic structure]". [19]
              | On the other hand, in an intertextual relation5, the utterance witnesses a subject.
              | In other words, an utterance in order to be part of a dialogical network has not
              | only to embody a semantic or logical relation to an object but also receive an
              | author, its originator by which he/she expresses his/her position. From language
              | we thus enter another realm of existence, that of subjectivity, as an utterance can
              | be the actual expression of the cognised self-understanding/representation. [20]
              | In order to understand international relations in a dialogical manner by focalising
              | on identity as a factor, it is then necessary to provide an analytical tool enabling
              | the cognisant to make sense of the cognised without reifying the latter according
              | to the problématique of the former. The hermeneutical locus provides such a tool
              | as it is characterised as the interweaving in a specific place (the utterance) of an
              | identity's expression, its contextuality and its relations to other identities (other
              | utterances). In review then, dialogism is defined as the interweaving of
              | utterances that respond to each other. An utterance is characterised as a
              | hermeneutical locus through its expression, its context and its relation to other
              | 5 Julia KRISTEVA introduced a distinction between intertextuality, the relation of any utterance
              | with other utterances, and dialogism in order to differentiate BAKHTIN's literary theory from his
              | anthropological philosophy (see KRISTEVA 1986a, pp.34-61; 1986b, pp.109-112).

              | utterances whether this relation is present and/or past, active and/or passive.
              | Furthermore, an utterance's addressivity links its discursive dimension to its
              | subjective one by enabling the discerning of its figuration of alterity, hence
              | dialogically of its own self. What is then missing is an understanding of the
              | significance of alterity to identity (and vice versa) within a dialogical framework.
              | BAKHTIN (1990, pp.15-16) characterises this relation between a self and an
              | other as transgredient. This notion, borrowed from nineteenth century German
              | school of aestheticism, states that an element is named transgredient when it
              | designates "elements of our conscience which are exteriors to it but nonetheless
              | essential to the process of its perfection, to its constitution as a totality"
              | (TODOROV 1981, p.146). Transgredience means that a self establishes a
              | necessary relation with a multitude of other selves (alterity); a self alone cannot
              | therefore constitute and be itself within its own realm of existence without the
              | other. According to BAKHTIN's anthropological philosophy, it is therefore
              | impossible to become truly self-conscious, to be one self, if one does not reveals
              | one's self to the other, through the other and with the help of the other (BAKHTIN
              | 1984, p.287). [21]
              | For BAKHTIN, in order to reach an encompassing view of a self, one has to
              | integrate through dialogue the vision of a multitude of interactions between the
              | self and selves (alterity) and their position in the world. Dialogism is therefore an
              | epistemologically sound way to establish such semantic network (BAKHTIN 1990,
              | p.36). Even monological utterances enter a dialogical network even if they
              | participate in an unsound ethical and epistemological position since they deny
              | "the existence outside itself of another consciousness with equal rights and equal
              | responsibilities, another I with equal rights [...]". Furthermore, in a monological
              | approach, taken at its extreme,
              | "[a]nother person remains wholly and merely an object of consciousness, and not
              | another consciousness. No response is expected from it that could change
              | everything in the world of my consciousness. Monologue is finalized and deaf to the
              | other's response, does not expect it and does not acknowledge in it any decisive
              | force. Monologue manages without the other, and therefore to some degree
              | materializes all reality. Monologue pretends to be the ultimate world. It closes down
              | the represented world and represented persons" (BAKHTIN 1984, pp.292-293). [22]
              | Within a monological figuration then, the other becomes an object of the self's
              | own conscience which can be interpreted and modified at will in function of the
              | self's own needs as a self-representation. BAKHTIN's dialogism is thus
              | concerned with both ethics and epistemology. Ethically, the completion and
              | perfection of one's self is determined by the reflexive and dialogical integration of
              | other selves (contrary to a monological perspective). Epistemologically, dialogism
              | enables us to access soundly the identity-alterity nexus by stressing their inter-
              | relations in an interweaving of mutually-responsive utterances which can be
              | understood by the delimitation of a hermeneutical locus. This interweaving
              | relation constitutes in turn the transgredient relation between a self and other
              | selves: one cannot be defined without an other. We will see in the next section

              | Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | the epistemic consequences this has on an IR theory aiming at tackling the
              | identity-alterity nexus in regards to the notions of subjectivity and reflexivity. [23]
              | Some IR scholars have already underlined the necessity to address the identity-
              | alterity nexus by stressing the ethical question "how we should treat the Other"
              | (WENDT 1999, pp.21-22, original emphasis) when we have to make sense of
              | international politics, which fundamentally is a politics of the other, a politics of
              | alterity (GUILLAUME 2002). Otherness should be taken into account in IR theory
              | to react to the positivistic orientation which dismissed the subjective quality of the
              | other by assuming that it is a functional equivalent to an identity (see WALTZ
              | 1979, pp.95-97). Furthermore, traditional approaches assumed the rationality,
              | and thus uniformity, of the multiple identities interacting in the international
              | system. They even dismissed the subjective quality of the identities at stake
              | refusing to acknowledge this "field of possibilities" (DOTY 1996, pp.340-341) that
              | the notions identity and alterity possess in their political, cultural and sometimes
              | vital implications. This specific "field of possibilities" is beginning to be explored
              | by IR scholars such as R.B.J. WALKER (1993) or David L. BLANEY and Naeem
              | INAYATULLAH (1994; INAYATULLAH & BLANEY 1996) whose postmodern or
              | critical approaches essentially focalised on normative and ethical dimensions.
              | These fundamental contributions, however, seem to adopt a "logic of identity"
              | without trying on the first hand to epistemologically integrate the identity-alterity
              | nexus to IR, and by extension the notions of subjectivity and reflexivity. [24]
              | This section tried to underline dialogism as an epistemological alternative to the
              | traditional positivist perspective underpinning most IR scholarship since the
              | 1950s. While positivism might have a certain relevance for number of topics
              | related to international relations, it remains that positivism is only but one
              | epistemic stance among others. Dialogism represents one of these possible
              | stances, in particular in relation to the identity-alterity nexus problématique which
              | positivism tends to avoid as the idea of the subjectivity of the cognised is
              | dismissed through the veil of objectivity. In effect, we have seen that a way to
              | tackle the identity-alterity nexus according to dialogism is to define identity as an
              | utterance in the sense and with the consequences I have underlined according to
              | a dialogical perspective. This perspective furthermore defines identity, a
              | subjectivity, in its transgredient relation to otherness, that is alternative subjective
              | self-understandings/representations. Dialogism is thus a way to address the first
              | level of the scientific inquiry, the level of the cognised's subjective relations, prob-
              | lematised in this framework as identities, by recognising the "object of study" as a
              | subiectum and not as a voiceless thing. The hermeneutical locus, understood
              | dialogically as the interwoven relations in an utterance of the identity-alterity
              | nexus, thus becomes the actual "dynamic epistemic structure according to which
              | the 'act' or 'phenomenal' event means and functions" (DOP 2000, p.18). The
              | cognised subjectivity is then accessible to the cognisant through an assessment
              | of its expressivity, its contextuality and its relationality vis-à-vis other subjective
              | self-understandings/ representations. This structure is constructed through the
              | problématique set up by the cognisant according to the epistemic limitations the
              | hermeneutical locus imposes on him. The next section will accordingly present a
              | relational assessment of the two levels of the scientific inquiry left. [25]

              | 3. The Hermeneutical Locus as a Reflexive Tool for and on
              | International Relations Theory
              | To consider the cognised as a subject is, of course, an ontological position in the
              | same sense that those who consider the cognised as an object participate to
              | another ontological position. To recognise this most forgotten evidence does not
              | only participate to a reflexive consideration about any form of approaches, such
              | as dialogism, but also requires us to undertake an epistemological discussion of
              | this approach according to this stance. In effect, any approach should to a
              | minimum extent integrate a reflection on the epistemic consequences one's own
              | ontological choices bear. Such assessments should, in turn, take into
              | consideration the two levels of scientific inquiry remaining to further discuss: i) the
              | relation between the cognisant and the cognised and, ii) the relations between
              | the cognisants. The hermeneutical locus, a dialogical mechanism I introduced in
              | the previous section, provides us with a tool by which both levels can be
              | considered in examining and taking into account the expressivity, the
              | contextuality and the relationality of each levels. Moreover, each level is more
              | particularly concerned with a specific problem or concern, whether that of
              | reification the cognisant might impose on the cognised or of the meaning of the
              | intersubjective quality of the relations existing between the cognisants. In other
              | words, the hermeneutical locus should represent a reflexive tool for and on IR
              | theory. [26]
              | As mentioned, one of the main problems which faces any approach wishing to
              | recognise the subjective quality of the cognised is that of reification. Dialogism,
              | via the hermeneutical locus, tries to bypass this problem by focusing on a
              | dialogical account of the cognised. In effect, according to this perspective, the
              | object of study is not the cognised itself but the process of their interrelations and
              | interactions. As Pierre BOURDIEU noted once, "il faut penser relationnellement"
              | [one has to think relationally] (1992a, p.200). The cognisant is actually fostering a
              | subjective and reflexive relation to the cognised according to a problématique
              | delineating the cognised's "objectivation" in its interrelations with other subjects.
              | BAKHTIN (1986c, p.161) sustains that a subject cannot, epistemologically, be
              | studied as thing for to do so would make it voiceless while being subiectum.
              | "Cognition of it [therefore] can only be dialogic". This signifies that the process of
              | objectivation, the structuring of a subject into a problématique, is possible as long
              | as this objectivation does not transform a subiectum into a voiceless object. The
              | objectivation should not become an instrumentalisation of the subject to the pro-
              | blématique and the subsequent theoretical framework as was the case with most
              | positivist scholarship. An interesting and simple example, illustrated by a recent
              | article from Richard LEBOW (2001), is the classical interpretation and use of
              | THUCYDIDES' History of the Peloponnesian War as a one of the main realist
              | forebear in their different claims about the structure of the war-peace nexus
              | (WALTZ 1979, p.127). THUCYDIDES has always been seen as one of the first
              | setting the underpinning elements of IR realism such as: (a) the centrality of the
              | states (city-states) as the dominant and functionally equivalent units of action; (b)
              | the depiction of the states as power-seeking entities whether as a means or as an
              | end and (c) the ascription to the states of a rational behaviour assessable in

              | Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | rational terms (KEOHANE 1986, p.7). Furthermore, THUCYDIDES' account of
              | war and his "causal" approach to facts made him an enlightened observer on the
              | mechanisms at work in an anarchic system—a system in which nothing higher
              | than the units can either delimit or reduce the units in their power-seeking drive
              | —, thus reflecting the "state of nature", a zero-sum game like environment, in
              | which these units act. THUCYDIDES is thus deemed to have set up and to reflect
              | the natural and unchanging rules that drove, drive and will drive the states in their
              | relations and then is basically reflecting the fundamental hard core of the realist
              | research programme (see LAKATOS 1970, p.48). [27]
              | These use and appropriation are, however, and to follow LEBOW (2001, p.559),
              | a "superficial and one-sided portrayal" of THUCYDIDES' book which is typical of
              | a certain perspective of IR theory as a nomothetic approach to the social world
              | (see LEVY 2001, p.41). In effect, realists tend to superimpose their programme's
              | hard core to the articulation of, in this case, THUCYDIDES' Peloponnesian War
              | while ignoring the incompleteness and errors such a superimposition bears
              | (BAGBY 1994, LEBOW 2001). These critics follows the line of the traditional
              | distinction between nomothetic (e.g. IR theory) and idiographic (e.g. history)
              | disciplines and the need for the former to adopt some of the latter's natural
              | impetus to regard evidences, whether pro or contra one's theory, and context as
              | compelling elements since the former tend to "allow their theories to take priority
              | over the evidence, focus on those historical events that confirm their theories,
              | and ignore the larger context in which events occur and in the absence of which
              | those events cannot be fully understood" (LEVY 2001, pp.49-50). The nomothetic
              | drive to construct and test theories is the underlying reason why THUCYDIDES
              | was perceived by the realists as a forebear since they picked in his work what
              | seemed to fulfil their expectations, as in the Melian Dialogue, and to provide a
              | test for their ahistorical theory on how international relations were framed and
              | worked. LEBOW strikingly demonstrates a contrario that if a "realist"
              | THUCYDIDES is indeed present, he is far from being the only, or even the most
              | important, THUCYDIDES speaking in the Peloponnesian War: There is also a
              | constructivist THUCYDIDES voicing in the text. In effect, a close reading of
              | THUCYDIDES' History shows that his underlying inquiry is that of the relationship
              | between nomos (convention) and phusis (nature), and its implications for the
              | constitution of the Greek culture and civilisation, and that his conclusion
              | emphasises the role of nomos in the construction of identities and in the
              | delineation and limitation of the behaviour of both individuals and societies
              | (LEBOW 2001). As this example illustrated, the main problem with non-reflexive
              | nomothetic perspectives is that they consider the way of doing science in what
              | Michel MEYER (1986, p.20) coins an apocritical direction, that is a direction which
              | isolate a certain number of problems (e.g. why states go to war?) and by
              | answering these problems seeks to solve and suppress them as such. In a
              | fashion that is parallel to natural sciences, the aim of "positivist" social sciences is
              | to offer, as Meyer underlined, "an apocritical answer [which] closes the inquiry,
              | stems back and breaks away from the problems at stake" as it provides an
              | answer which is supposed to solve and suppress the question altogether. [28]

              | Social sciences, however, by answering to a problématique do not actually solve,
              | and thus suppress, the "problem" at the origin the latter. Natural sciences deal
              | with objective questionings that require definite answers in order to suppress
              | them. Of course, once solved these questionings create new ones but they are
              | definitively "behind" in the realm of science. In other words, we do not ask
              | ourselves the question to know why an apple falls from a tree anymore yet we still
              | wonder why states go to war. This recurrent questioning still manage to create
              | wide debates in IR, as in the Democratic Peace debate, despite nearly three
              | thousands years of more or less cunning tries from THUCYDIDES' hubris to
              | HUNTINGTON's civilisational explanation. Maybe the right answer has yet to be
              | found, and many liberals see in the Democratic Peace argument such a definite
              | answer (see RUSSETT 1993), yet none of the answers so far given brought
              | about the suppression of the question "why states go to war?" or the peace-war
              | nexus problématique as such. Anyhow, if Democratic Peace proponents would
              | prove that in order to solve and suppress this question altogether it was
              | necessary to establish global democracy in the world, it remains nonetheless that
              | the peace-war nexus would still remain as a problématique, whether or not it is
              | transformed in a softer or more focused articulation between co-operation and
              | conflict. States, or other agents of international relations, will always interact,
              | perform or behave in a way that will require IR scholars to consider which nexus
              | might be the most relevant to explain or understand some phenomena. [29]
              | The focus of IR theory should then shift from this traditional apocritical direction,
              | which blindfolds many IR scholars from epistemic and, often, methodological
              | problems, to a more reflexive direction as underlined by ALVESSON and
              | SKÖLDBERG's definition (2000, p.5). As their definition suggests, there are two
              | moments in which reflexivity can take part in IR theory. The first movement is
              | related to the second level of the scientific inquiry while the second movement is
              | related to the third level. On the one hand, reflexivity is thus present in the
              | relations the cognisant has with the cognised, that is how the former reflexively
              | constructs the latter and the process of its interactions and interrelations with
              | other subjects. Dialogism offers such a frame, as presented in the previous
              | section, by delineating the cognisant scope of inquiry according to a reflexive tool,
              | the hermeneutical locus, which specifically deals with processuality, through its
              | focus on relationality, and aims at bridging IR theory nomothetic tradition to a
              | more idiographic conception for dialogism possesses a particular interest in
              | contextuality and expressivity. The three elements of the hermeneutical locus
              | entail that a special attention should be paid to the actual reflexive way by which
              | the cognisant chooses the "identities" at stake in its construction of a
              | problématique. An elegant way to further avoid reification and instrumentalization
              | is thus to employ conscious counterfactual thought experiments which, in the
              | words of Philip TETLOCK and Aaron BELKIN (1996, p.15), provides, by
              | "asking people to think how things could have worked out differently[,] a means of
              | preventing the world that did occur from blocking our views of the worlds that might
              | well have occurred if some antecedent condition had taken on a different value". [30]

              | Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | This specification is only one among several, and not the most important to their
              | eyes, that counterfactuals could take according to TETLOCK and BELKIN. Both
              | authors actually favour counterfactuals within a highly positivist perspective on
              | how to deal with social sciences, rejecting altogether the implications of
              | counterfactuals within more interpretative perspectives (whether constructivist or
              | postmodern for instance) in world politics. Hence, TETLOCK and BELKIN
              | implicitly put aside those latter perspectives as unscientific as they are and not
              | being able to predict events and only able to offer subjective, circular and
              | nonfalsifiable standpoints (TETLOCK & BELKIN 1996, pp.27, 30-31, 37-38). This
              | view, as stressed by Steven WEBER (1996) and Richard LEBOW (2000, p.578),
              | is extremely reductive on the possible use of such an interesting tool and one
              | should, on the contrary, expand its scope by focusing more on its use as a way
              | "to accrue evidence and arguments to convince people that some hypotheses are
              | probably weak and others probably stronger" (WEBER 1996, p.272).
              | Furthermore, and as specified by LEBOW (2000, p.551, my emphasis), "the
              | methods of counterfactual experimentation need to be commensurate with the
              | purposes for which they are used [...]". A dialogical understanding of international
              | relations specifically undertakes such experimentation by concentrating on
              | contextuality and expressivity in order to determine which utterances, which
              | competing or alternative self-understanding/ representation(s) are to be
              | considered as dominant in the dialogical constitution and performance of an
              | intersubjective representation defined as national. There are naturally many
              | dialogical interactions constituting a self-understanding/representation, the point
              | being to evaluate which dialogue is dominant for a specific self-
              | understanding/representation within a situated intersubjectivity. The dominant dia-
              | logue should henceforth arise as a heuristic momentum only if it is put in
              | perspective with counterfactual dominant and non-dominant dialogues, that is
              | alternative dialogues which allow the cognisant to a situated and processual
              | reference outside the self-understanding/representation constructed as a subject of
              | study. This necessity to evaluate alternative, counterfactual elements arise from
              | the risk that the dialogue constructed by the cognisant has been so to explain or
              | understand events ex post facto, that is it has been chosen in order to explain or
              | understand a certain outcome, or even to fulfil the expectancies of the
              | problématique or the theoretical model chosen by the cognisant (this point always
              | had been a major criticism to nomothetic disciplines from more idiographic ones).
              | Such a construction would not be epistemologically sound since it would then
              | make inferences in the perspective of the outcome. [31]
              | Counterfactuals constitute therefore a way to reflexively and soundly construct a
              | problématique and its related theoretical developments. Furthermore,
              | counterfactual thought experiments are vital ingredients in the evaluation and
              | testing of the heuristic of the dominant dialogue proposed by the cognisant (see
              | LEBOW 2000, pp.558-564). This counterfactual logic globally follows a double
              | rationale which firstly establishes a dominant dialogue as a "logical imperative",
              | appealing to a more nomothetic dimension, within a certain context by imagining
              | what other dialogues would plausibly be and which relevance they would have in
              | a specified situated intersubjectivity and relationality. This logical exercise is
              | aimed at establishing the sine qua non dialogue in a certain contextuality framed

              | Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | by the problématique. Consequently, however, this dominant dialogue also has to
              | be a "historical imperative", the second component of the counterfactual rationale
              | and which would result in a more idiographic dimension in IR theory, if one wants
              | to reach a sound understanding. This historical imperative seeks to consider the
              | alternatives which were actually offered by the cognised according to contempo-
              | rary evidence (see FERGUSON 1997, p.79-90).6 The dominant dialogue chosen
              | should therefore be the result of a double rationale—logical and historical—which
              | through an evaluation of the possible alternatives and of the robustness of
              | historical evidences should both alleviate the reification of the "identities"
              | contemplated, rule out a deterministic study of their dialogue and evaluate the
              | historical pertinence of the dialogue chosen by situating them simultaneously
              | within a probabilistic frame and a historical relevance. [32]
              | Reflexivity, on the other hand, is also present in the relations the cognisant
              | entertains with other cognisant. Reflexivity, following BOURDIEU's "epistemic
              | reflexivity" (BOURDIEU & WACQUANT 1992), means that the cognisant has to
              | consider that him/herself as a "cultural producer" and thus to reflect on the "socio-
              | historical conditions of possibility" of this specific discourse that is science. The
              | point is to subject the cognisant to the same critical inquiry he/she was compelled
              | to apply to the cognised. In BOURDIEU's terminology, any discipline of social
              | sciences has to undertake a work of "objectivation of the subject who objectivize"
              | in which open debates and mutual criticism, dialogical debates BAKHTIN would
              | say, are undertaken in order to institutionalise reflexivity. IR, however, possessed
              | and still possess to a large extent, according to LAPID (1989, pp.249-250), "the
              | dubious honor of being among the least self-reflexive of the Western social
              | sciences". Some IR scholars have nonetheless tried to tackle the notion of
              | reflexivity and to provide an account of it within the discipline. So far, the most
              | thorough treatment of the notion of reflexivity in IR, to my knowledge, is to be
              | found in Mark NEUFELD's The Restructuring of International Relations Theory
              | (1995). NEUFELD (pp.13-21), drawing from KANT, HEGEL and MARX, situates
              | "theoretical reflexivity", in the overall category of critical thinking, as one of the
              | main characteristics of emancipatory theory. This specific positioning stands in
              | sharp opposition to positivist IR theory, and provides a special "attention to the
              | creative role of human consciousness, and an engagement in social criticism in
              | support of practical political activity orientated toward radical social change",
              | theoretical reflexivity therefore being the "theoretical reflection on the process of
              | theorizing itself". This general definition embeds three core elements which are
              | "(i) self-consciousness about underlying premises; (ii) the recognition of the
              | inherently politico-normative dimension of paradigms and the normal science
              | tradition they sustain; and (iii) the affirmation that reasoned judgements about the
              | merits of contending paradigms are possible in the absence of a neutral
              | observation of language". NEUFELD acknowledges that (i) is admittedly
              | recognised by both positivist and post-positivist stances but stresses that (ii) and
              | 6 Richard LEBOW (2000, pp.567-574) proposes a very strong criticism of FERGUSON's overall
              | use of counterfactuals. These criticisms are justified especially as FERGUSON's historical
              | restrictions would "exclude entire categories of plausible-world counterfactuals" (p.569). The
              | perspective that I propose hereby is nonetheless still consistent with LEBOW's criteria
              | (pp.581-585) as I try to adapt counterfactuals to a use specific to more interpretative
              | perspectives in IR theory and with a precise epistemological articulation.

              | (iii) are actually what makes "reflexivity a virtual antonym of positivism"
              | (pp.40-41). Both elements, in effect, oppose the positivist standpoint about "truth
              | as correspondence" and science as a "process without a subject". If anyone
              | committed to a post-positivist perspective can readily agree on the second
              | element, one has to be careful on the first. NEUFELD's normative and
              | emancipatory stances, on the one hand, recognise the intersubjective nature of
              | science (p.42), yet, on the other hand, reassess the necessity of a truth value
              | which would not be situated anymore in an empirical reality, however constructed
              | by the cognisant, but through each theories' politico-normative assumptions. In a
              | paradoxical way, NEUFELD, and many other normativists, actually abide to a
              | form of "positivism" as they remain attached to a fundamental criteria linked to
              | the basic principle of "truth as correspondence", "truth" in this case being the
              | normative requirement of emancipation. Consider the following (p.44):
              | "[...] reflexive theorists accept incommensurability as the necessary consequence of
              | the fact that paradigm-specific knowledge-defining standards are themselves
              | intimately connected to and embedded in competing social and political agendas, the
              | political-normative contents of which are not amenable to any neutral observation
              | language". [33]
              | In other words, since "empirie" does not fit to be a relevant referent as there is no
              | neutral observation language, contending perspectives cannot be confronted
              | according to this form of referent. Yet, "reflexive theorists do not accept that
              | recognizing contending paradigms as incommensurable means reasoned
              | assessments are impossible". Furthermore (p.46), "judgements about contending
              | paradigms are possible by means of reasoned assessments of the politico-
              | normative content of the projects they serve, of the ways of life to which they
              | correspond". Thus, judgement is possible with an admittedly unneutral
              | observation language which will reasonably evaluate the different "paradigms"
              | according to a normative referent, that of the emancipatory potential of these
              | "paradigms". If I supported the idea that this type of normativism can be equated
              | to "positivism", it was to underline that both perspectives were attached to the
              | idea of truth, whether "empirical" or "normative", in an epistemic assessment of
              | the value of a theory. The notion of truth, however, has long been discarded by
              | most contemporary epistemologists (see AGAZZI 1988) as an aporia alleviated
              | by the simple knowledge that all scientific (or normative) inquiry participate in an
              | open intersubjective discourse. The point of reflexivity in IR theory precisely is to
              | recognise the intersubjective process any "paradigm" went through in order to
              | establish "operative criteria" on the use of certain number of notions (e.g. anarchy
              | or identity) in order to set a scientific (or normative) agenda according to an
              | agreement on these criteria (see AGAZZI 1988, p.19). The danger of NEUFELD's
              | perspective is to reduce IR theory to a mere backup of theories deemed
              | "emancipatory", the new criterion of truth, which will be defined through "a
              | broader debate about which 'purposes', which 'enquiries' and which 'ideologies'
              | merit the support and energy of International Relations scholars" (NEUFELD
              | 1995, p.68, my emphasis). NEUFELD proposes a crude and simplistic opposition
              | between "science" and "politico-normative" which does not take into account the
              | possibility to render and recognise the second while continuing working in the

              | framework of the first. If one can understand NEUFELD's will to replace the idea
              | of episteme, a timeless and unchanging perspective, by that of phronesis,
              | integrating variability and contingency (p.45), one cannot fail to situate NEUFELD
              | in close range to doxa, the realm of opinion, as the validity criterion chosen by
              | him is highly subjective, not even intersubjective. To the credit of NEUFELD, one
              | has nonetheless to recognise with him that IR theory, as underlined WEBER
              | (2001, pp.129-134), is a site of cultural practice.
              | "It is a site where stories that make sense of our world are spun, where signifying
              | practices about international politics take place, where meanings about international
              | life are produced, reproduced, and exchanged. [...] More importantly, IR theory is a
              | site of cultural practice because it provides a framework for storytelling itself"
              | (pp.129-130, original emphasis). [34]
              | As it is rightly pointed by many critical theorists, whether or not following
              | NEUFELD's predicaments, IR theory had the tendency to consider its own
              | framework of analysis, alongside many different concepts such as anarchy or
              | identity, as natural, neutral and unbiased as they were considered to participate in
              | the scientific inquiry in the tradition of "real science". Mainstream IR theory further
              | participated in a standardisation of the discipline by expelling alternative
              | explanations, usually based on non-positivist or non-quantitativist positions, in
              | light of their "constructivist", "unneutral" or "biased" grounding. They placed
              | alternative perspectives outside the realm of IR theory, i.e. the realm of science,
              | and rejected them altogether as most of these perspectives tried to provide a
              | more reflexive turn and function, in the sense given by ALVESSON and
              | SKÖLDBERG, to the discipline (see WEBER 2001, p.131). These parochial
              | views on IR theory were due, in my opinion and as we foresaw in the previous
              | section, to a misplaced focus on what was to be understood as "science",
              | "empirical" or "unbiased", as natural sciences were the actual referent to social
              | sciences. In light of the discussion so far, it seems necessary to create new
              | foundations for social sciences, foundations which acknowledge the peculiar
              | nature of the cognised and the specific place of the cognisant in their overall
              | interactions in a system of knowledge aside from the realm of opinion and
              | political partisanship. [35]
              | Dialogism, by the intermediary of the hermeneutical locus, provides a reflexive
              | account of IR theory as a site of cultural practice. The hermeneutical locus can in
              | effect be used on utterances (e.g. realism, liberalism, constructivism,
              | postmodernism, etc.) which will be examined as specific utterances according to
              | their place in the academic discussion concerning international relations, thus
              | offering an analysis of IR which takes as a starting point the idea that each
              | current within our discipline, as any fields of social sciences, or any specific
              | discursive assessment (a book, an article, a presentation, etc.), can be
              | considered through a reflexive investigation. The aim of this investigation is to link
              | both the critical tradition, represented here by NEUFELD, and a more traditional
              | "disciplinary history" (see HOLDEN 2002). It is, in a way, to ask for an
              | archaeology of IR theory in all its dimensions. As HOLDEN (2002, p.255)
              | rightfully noted, there should not be any "privileged vantage-point from which IR's
              | © 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/

              | Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | disciplinary history can be written. This means that 'critical IR' itself needs to be
              | analysed and contextualized". Critical IR, like any other currents of IR theory, has
              | to submit itself to the same scrutiny it used to submit the others. This scrutiny, as
              | I just mentioned, can take the form of an archaeology, a term inspired by Michel
              | FOUCAULT (1969) who gave it to his inquiry of discourses some 30 years ago. [36]
              | An archaeology (FOUCAULT 1969, pp.182-183) is fundamentally not a way to
              | find a hidden discourse behind the utterance under examination, in a structuralist
              | sense, but a way to define utterances as such, as "practices obeying to rules". An
              | archaeology of IR aims to define an utterance within IR discourse in its specificity
              | vis-à-vis other utterances and in their unity within "the types and rules of discurs-
              | ive practices that go beyond the individuals works". An archaeology is, finally, an
              | exteriority which does not aim at describing the origin of an utterance but at sys-
              | tematically depicting the latter as an "object" of inquiry. We clearly see here that
              | we are at the juncture of both critical tradition and a more traditional intellectual-
              | historical perspective. In effect, by paying attention to practices, FOUCAULT
              | wanted to pay attention to "a preconceptual, anonymous, socially sanctioned body
              | of rules that govern one's manner of perceiving, judging, imagining, and acting"
              | (FLYNN 1994, p.30). This is to be linked to the critical tradition. FOUCAULT's
              | objective (1969, pp.170-173), however, was also to pay attention to the archive,
              | that is "a practice which raise a multiplicity of utterances as many regular events".
              | The archive is fundamentally "the general system of the formation and
              | transformation of the utterances". An archaeology is then the description of "the
              | utterances as specified practices in their modality of archive". This is to be linked
              | to the intellectual-historical tradition. As FLYNN noted (1994, p.30),
              | "an archive is the locus of the rules and prior practices forming the conditions of
              | inclusion or exclusion that enable certain practices and prevent others from being
              | accepted as 'scientific,' or 'moral,' or whatever other social rubric may be in use at a
              | particular epoch. [...] Reference to 'epoch' is crucial, for these archives are time-
              | bound and factual; they are discovered, not deduced; they are the locus of practices
              | as 'positivities' to be encountered, not as 'documents' to be interpreted. [...] The claim
              | that these practices are to be registered as facts, not read as the result of intentions
              | of some sort, gives [...] [Foucault's] archaeology its 'positivist' tilt [...]". [37]
              | By considering a precise current of IR theory, from realism to critical theories, as
              | a hermeneutical locus, dialogism can reflexively bring about a refined analysis of
              | IR theory in the overall sense inspired by FOUCAULT's archaeology. Contextually
              | speaking, an utterance, such as that of realism in IR theory, has to be considered
              | as a practice, in the sense given above, taking into account its predicates,
              | assertions and norms as to retrace both the "internal discursive" and the external
              | impetus behind the origin and evolution of this specific utterance within the
              | discourse of IR. Expressively, the many assertions constituting realism—e.g. the
              | books, articles, conferences, interviews of their proponents—are as many
              | elements delineating an archive and thus subject to both "internal" and "external"
              | inquiry. This type of work is to a certain extent already at the heart of the present
              | focus of "the contextualizers", to borrow HOLDEN's terminology (2002). What is
              | missing, however, is this relational dimension under which should also be

              | analysed the contribution of these utterances in an intersubjective discussion
              | which has been one of the focus of this paper: IR theory discourse. Who is
              | "realism" or any "critical theory" answering to? To which extent their utterances
              | reflect monological or dialogical approaches to the cognised or to other
              | cognisant? How are contextually and expressively constructed the approaches'
              | archives within IR theory and, more generally, within social sciences? Are these
              | approaches even taking part in the epistemic reflexivity any discipline has to go
              | through? As these last questions imply, the cognisant should consciously and
              | dialogically participate in IR discourse comprehended as a semantic network. The
              | notion of reflexivity, as presented here, is a way to go beyond the antinomic
              | perspectives of postmodernism, in which is embedded the idea of deconstruction,
              | and modernism, in which is embedded the idea of positivist social sciences.
              | Reflexivity should link the possibility and the necessity of the scientific knowledge
              | with the idea that any knowledge should be deconstructed as a contingent notion
              | grounded in political, social, economic and historical dimensions. As accurately
              | noted by WACQUANT (BOURDIEU & WACQUANT 1992, p.38), "to confuse the
              | politics of science (knowledge) with that of society (power), is [in the end] to reject
              | the historically instituted autonomy of the scientific field". [38]
              | The aim of this section was to underscore the necessity for social sciences, and
              | by extension IR theory, to recognise the subjective quality of its "object of study".
              | As mentioned alongside BAKHTIN (1981, p.351), social sciences possess "the
              | specific task of establishing, transmitting and interpreting the words of others".
              | The process of objectification should then not be equated to a process of
              | reification in which the cognised becomes a voiceless thing instrumentalised by a
              | research programme. The cognised, as a subjective self-understanding/repre-
              | sentation, has to be integrated within IR theory in an epistemological framework,
              | such as dialogism, which structurally tries to avoid the process of reification and
              | thus avoid entering in either the "logic of anarchy" or that of "identity". The use of
              | a counterfactual logic has thus been presented as a complementary way to avoid
              | reification of the cognised within a certain problématique and to reflexively justify
              | the choice of the setting in an hermeneutical locus. Furthermore, dialogism has
              | been presented in opposition to an apocritical perspective and linked to a fully
              | reflexive and ongoing appraisal of (i) the cognisant relations to the cognised,
              | through the problématique and the objectivation; (ii) the cognisant relations to
              | other cognisant within the intersubjective realm of science. In order to achieve
              | this goal, it has been underlined that IR theory has to face the task of recognising
              | itself as a site of cultural practice and thus acknowledge the need of an
              | archaeology of the discipline and its different currents. A dialogical perspective
              | thus wishes to provide a way to account a real dialogue for and on IR theory. [39]

              | Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory
              | 4. Conclusion
              | The BAKHTINian definition of dialogism—as an interweaving of utterances
              | characterised by their contextuality, expressivity and relationality—thus unveils an
              | onto-epistemic dimension designating a process by which any cognised is
              | accessible to any cognisant as long as it is replaced within its subjective semantic
              | network and its relationality to other cognised. Accordingly dialogism is not only a
              | reflexive way by which we can construct knowledge about the social world we
              | study as cognisant but also a way by which we can analyse and evaluate the
              | social world we construct as producers of knowledge. This is to follow
              | BOURDIEU in his opinion that the models used by the cognisant to make sense
              | of the cognised should also be reflexively applied onto the cognisant him/herself
              | (BOURDIEU & WACQUANT 1992). The hermeneutical locus has been presented
              | as a reflexive tool for IR theory as a way to avoid reification and monologism
              | when the cognisant is constituting his problématique and thus is dealing with the
              | cognised. Furthermore, the hermeneutical locus has been equally portrayed as a
              | reflexive tool on IR theory in order to provide the discipline with an archaeology
              | aiming at reconstituting the dialogical relations different IR currents entertain one
              | with another and to qualify and situate each archive with the IR theory discourse.
              | These basic conclusions concerning a dialogical approach do not limit
              | themselves to the sole field of IR theory. All fields of social sciences might benefit
              | from a more reflexive approach whether to their "subject"/ "object" of study or to
              | their own discipline itself. A greater epistemological self-consciousness and self-
              | assertiveness within any type of problématique or research design might prove to
              | be a heuristic drive to improve and better delineate the definition of some arch-
              | concept such as power or identity, as such concepts should reflexively be
              | connected to the problématique at work. [40]
              | It is important to note that a dialogical perspective does not seek to provide the
              | only framework by which subjectivity and reflexivity would be better integrated in
              | IR theory. NEUFELD's attempt (1995) is only but one other framework according
              | to which subjectivity and reflexivity can be addressed within IR. NEUFELD,
              | however, is an epitome of the danger of such an integration if one wants to
              | situate reflexivity and subjectivity at the heart of scientific inquiry. To situate such
              | notions within scientific inquiry is admittedly a normative assumption as to know
              | what is the core of the social sciences composed of. Furthermore, within IR
              | theory, it is to normatively reject monological account of the cognised. But the
              | overall aim of a scientific inquiry, contrary to NEUFELD's politico-normative
              | perspective, is to constitute a body of knowledge within an open and
              | intersubjective discussion (AGAZZI 1988) and not to promote any ideological
              | agenda. To integrate the idea of subjectivity and reflexivity precisely is to
              | constitute a body of knowledge that is self-aware, through its own archaeology, of
              | its bias and limitations. Positivist perspectives, as well as constructivist or critical
              | perspectives, within IR have to take account for the specific characterisation of
              | their "object of study" and to focalise on the process of their interactions and
              | interrelations. A dialogical approach, as I showed, offers such an overall
              | perspective and is specifically designed to tackle the specific nexus between
              | identity and alterity. The latter nexus possesses probably far more reaching

              | potentialities for IR theory than the classical war-peace nexus as it creates more
              | common grounds on which cross-field discussions or examinations can take
              | place. For instance, one can think about linking normative theories about
              | citizenship and politics of recognition (see GIANNI 1998) with IR theoretical
              | perspectives on the interrelations between domestic and international issues
              | focalising on the notion of "national identity" (see KRATOCHWIL 1996). A
              | dialogical approach would thus be a common denominator to reflexively compare
              | and combine both fields. Moreover, this essay wished to establish that a
              | dialogical understanding was a potentially feasible approach to cognise world
              | politics and that to address the question of epistemology was neither a mere
              | speciality nor personal choice but a real heuristic plus for any searchers wishing
              | to clarify and to expand their knowledge on their own practice. [41]
